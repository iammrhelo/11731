you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of <unk> research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones <unk> by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
just to know that jaguar <unk> still journey beyond the milky way , or the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the himalaya , the buddhists still pursue the breath of the <unk> , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initiation <unk> .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> desert of northern kenya , the <unk> in the mountains of the andes , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of <unk> , everest , the goddess mother of the world .
all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of <unk> yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
