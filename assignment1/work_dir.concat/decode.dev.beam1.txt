and yet , you can hear black holes , even if they &apos;re invisible , the reason is that they &apos;re on space-time on the floor like a drum .

for example , when his <unk> <unk> was he asked , &quot; and who are these <unk> young men ? &quot;
and then if you &apos;re standing there , the boy went up vertically , 30 feet high , and disappeared .
these properties of a dialogue are not at these <unk> .

it was supposed to attack the entire area of the attack .
a approach would be to draw a painting .
if we look at the double helix in your two strands , you see these things like teeth .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
one is a <unk> of a hummingbird .

thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things .
in fact , everything about being <unk> and <unk> and <unk> -- cold , challenging conditions .
first we &apos;ve created a little experiment that we gave people legos and they asked them to build something .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new , and as you , as you , we have the other thing that they had built , again , again , again , again .
there was a very beautiful relationship between love to lego and the number of legos .
and i think the ceo basically understands how important meaning is .
but i should point out to point , so that in the fact that the people would have predicted to cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
think of children now .
and i think that in the industrial revolution , adam smith was <unk> , as karl marx , but we really have <unk> . and now we &apos;re in the knowledge of knowledge .
this is in modern conflict , and it &apos;s very natural , because children are very easily to the war .
so the mother &apos;s mother was so bad that she was so bad that she was doing to make our story <unk> , all boys and girls have given new <unk> names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .

as a boy , since the earliest of the earliest , i wanted to be a musician and god thank you , i &apos;m sure i was too .
he &apos;s a boy from a community in cairo who did his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with passion .
so this is encouraging new dreams , new targets and advancements at the various opportunities that has to offer music .
this is a <unk> technology that helps you to do the simple task that &apos;s right at the right time to make the right pill to be able to do .
like , we &apos;re going to call simple , off-the-shelf technologies , and that &apos;s the first of five sentences that i &apos;m going to discuss in this talk .
this year is this year . she went into the <unk> .

i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and unforgettable inventions of cybercriminals .

so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker call the attacker &apos;s <unk> hacker , something that we call a <unk> .
there are some other things that are uploaded to the cybercriminals .
now , you probably wonder , what happened to these people .
and at <unk> of you , i found identify hotels in the hotels that they were recently recently , with <unk> precision somewhere in the globe .

<unk> is also really cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. hans <unk> at the university of university , with <unk> at <unk> .
people always say , &quot; why does you do this ?
finally , i began writing my book to try to show the worldwide scale of this problem , this shows a <unk> line of the individual nations to the <unk> level of food in every country in every country around the world .
so imagine these nine biscuits that i found in the dump represent the world , the world &apos;s <unk> , okay ? at the beginning we have nine .
so this farmer about 16,000 pounds in the growing farmers decided that he was a piece of being filmed , because a little grass potatoes , not to be perfect , are not <unk> to the pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , i cut a piece , put it into a vase and it still leaves another two weeks .
and if you &apos;re using these things , you don &apos;t need to make <unk> .
i &apos;m going to go through a few of my <unk> .
left left to <unk> .
we need to change the stuff .
here &apos;s einstein , of course , <unk> <unk> , the big <unk> sentence , and i &apos;m not sure that james <unk> is the james <unk> or richard harris .

it would definitely be done by people here .
if we had an opportunity to have gotten the opportunity to <unk> the way we talked about the <unk> of the military , we &apos;d talked about the <unk> of the military , and we could predict an era of stability in europe or in europe .
now , in this environment , where you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy or attack , and whether the gun is the attack of the attack , that &apos;s what most of them is to trigger a conflict .
it &apos;s a giant blue area .
so , you &apos;ve ever got to go back to the time to see how a dinosaur would have looked like this , so a dinosaur looks like a dinosaur .

each of their <unk> depends on this critical region , the <unk> , who &apos;s over the 10,000 independent cells , which is every <unk> rhythm -- a high tension rhythm -- a high tension rhythm -- a very low tension -- a low -- to the <unk> .
they were a little bit of sync in sync , but then apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews of people who were going to opened up to the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t think you &apos;re not going to be a metronome , but we all walk -- we <unk> <unk> and back to walking .
am : this weighs just a few tons , so you &apos;re going to go right fast .
but the <unk> scientist in his field .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told them they should be told you , you should look at her name , or the <unk> of her mother .

albert von <unk> once said that , &quot; discoveries are made to see what everyone &apos;s thought , and think what &apos;s nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> at discover magazine .
it &apos;s got fun , unlike any ordinary problems that are honest with no very well <unk> puzzles .
one is the back of the other .
you can &apos;t do that , you can &apos;t physically do it , but it goes back to a computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
so what are going to fall ?
so there &apos;s games like the brain to <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really think a girl is so powerful that we all had to train them to be training .
i remember , as an example , my father was very , very violent , to me .
we &apos;re used to incorporate girls of being a <unk> girl , <unk> of their own life , and they actually made them to objects and they turned into .
and she looked in the eyes of her baby and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , she was a ritual where she was girls who are <unk> , with their families , with their families .

i was a teenager , when i first read &quot; anna <unk> &quot; and the famous sentence i read , &quot; all happy families .
i want to show you how something you can see is that we can look at this .
if i came into the water here , you see a <unk> <unk> and this <unk> is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> water from the himalaya of the himalaya .
and plato , all the boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;m going to show you .

one thing i want to make is that not all the <unk> wear <unk> .
we can <unk> them or turn them up or <unk> .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it to the circuits in terms of depression .
we &apos;re understanding what these circuits are and what the brain areas are and what the brain are in the clinical edge and symptoms of these diseases are responsible .
evolution works in a really rather rather than an engineer .
that &apos;s enough .
what we &apos;ve discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being , like richard , or a <unk> or a crab or a crab , the relative <unk> of this feather is equal to all that we have to now have .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s amazing students , and they couldn &apos;t tell you .
he does this with a <unk> glue .
what we &apos;re doing is we take the hair as a model model , and put them together with another colleague of berkeley .
and what showed you that from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , two thirds of the men are kids , but only one-third of the women of women are .
on monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and i flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , looking at us , and we &apos;re going to say , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous trial of harvard business school school school school called heidi <unk> .
and i got my hand back , and i fell in my hand , and i &apos;ve got more questions about all the other women , and you &apos;ve asked them to ask them , just by men . &quot;
a woman approached me on this , and i looked at her -- she looked a little bit .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as much as they should , but they do .
so not fear was the <unk> factor .
but it &apos;s the middle of the black .
so i want to talk to you now about how we &apos;re going to spread , how we get information about information , how we get information to information .
so , you &apos;re in <unk> , <unk> language . and this works .

if a <unk> <unk> , the grass is going to be on these <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be something interesting .
and now i &apos;m saying that i want to make a game of games on the top , but it &apos;s not true , because it &apos;s already in the development ; it &apos;s already happening .
if not , that &apos;s a bad thing . there &apos;s nothing to do you .
come at a certain time , you get your drinks to half a prize .
and then they can really do good in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a vibrant dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we talked the last time many years ago .
you can also see that i turn around this -- hopefully i don &apos;t shave the world too much .
you can see , here &apos;s how it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who actually had to teach students students , the law of the <unk> , just as a hobby of the <unk> , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
that &apos;s what makes it fun to work on .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who excited excited about it and crazy enough that they work on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what &apos;s brunel , how to reach for his passengers was the experience of the landscape , the experience of the landscape .

from my romantic surprise , the waiter with his boss .
mark <unk> and i have tried to answer that question , right ?
but it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demanded .

&quot; well , it &apos;s a very fancy <unk> of pink . &quot;
so the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re more competent problems that are controlled by nature .
so thank you . thank you .
it &apos;s to replace competition with cooperation .
and then we &apos;re building a <unk> that we can test to the <unk> power of machines , and we can actually , very quickly , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the best <unk> is not going to be understood as a <unk> movement , but as a <unk> movement .
the <unk> step up the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear nuclear power station would provide the energy to the rest of los angeles .
and you take it to you and stick it to the screen of your television , and it &apos;s <unk> from the inside , right ?
if you replace the word , if you replace the internet , it &apos;s very real , that his attitude is now very <unk> . let &apos;s hear it in the same time .
i think it was that exchange that led to the rest of the consequences .
ph : i hope you can grasp it , how do this .
ultimately , the race race to make the future , as the phone company <unk> .
mm : because it has a role in the audience , doing something .
they &apos;re making things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has made what &apos;s built , is a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is an spanish architect and designer .
color : color can <unk> simple , simple materials , if i go through new york , i think .
it &apos;s got me giving up suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco and we all talk about it and build a few installations .
the operation that has laid down the city for the day , is significantly , almost an international model .
even the bits of the airplane had a french machine .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , i ended up with some <unk> and <unk> , at design of the chair that i ended up showing you .
he said , you have one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re just going to be the same position .
but i knew what i knew and i <unk> myself in the office where there was <unk> with <unk> , that never would have anyone to turn to the idea , to turn the headrest in a <unk> and <unk> the headrest .
and dengue fever has spread into <unk> .
two days ago , i was reading , i can &apos;t remember this kind of <unk> , i &apos;ve read that <unk> <unk> , that <unk> the first <unk> of <unk> , about 52 <unk> cases , with about 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that really <unk> the fact that it &apos;s not going to spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males who meets females , every lot of a lot .
so , <unk> are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time , i &apos;m not <unk> of it , although i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the data data .
now , our mobile phone can be construct a story now of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : their health depend depend on where they live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
from the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
as the beginning explains how to pull out , they move phosphorus from water from the ground .
here &apos;s a remarkable article article from a <unk> of &quot; nature , &quot; which is the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it is mentioned like mentioned .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we &apos;re taking one of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and one that &apos;s going to <unk> some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re doing in the world .
and he was called a &quot; <unk> : he looked all the <unk> and mutations of find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps are withheld , but they &apos;re repeating themselves without being <unk> .
as an architect , i think i &apos;m just thinking about relationships between the pieces and the whole , but in terms of design technology , it &apos;s always more a matter of business .
we &apos;re <unk> at the level of the building of the building , where we could build five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor of the <unk> .
come back again , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;re going to see this landscape in fact , rather than <unk> <unk> .
the difference is particularly in <unk> in <unk> , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever they want .
here &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal to be used , and now they &apos;re in the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers that are causing huge problems in the water , and the rivers , lakes and even seas , and it &apos;s the most important <unk> of <unk> .
but we can get that and there are opportunities .
so irrigation is the largest <unk> on the <unk> .
to work together .
so what &apos;s the case that &apos;s designed system d.
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
all the system that doesn &apos;t pay control .
we &apos;re interacting with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological &apos;s space to augment these <unk> .
so this is what this looks like .
here we <unk> , or cut the nerve free , from little parts of the <unk> and let &apos;s give other pristine <unk> that gave us our <unk> -- signal , two others that gave us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode in it and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically to wear a meal .
this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
sub-sahara has been transformed , there &apos;s a <unk> between hiv , there are <unk> 70 million people living with hiv 30 million people who are infected with the world .
governments in place have to create effective policy problems in clinical trials in clinical trials in clinical trials , which is being authorized in the different world , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the government of the study and the <unk> of the study .
so the fundamental issues that we face are a high consumption and too many people .
so they all fulfill the criteria that they would like to do .
so you see this electricity that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that &apos;s going to come up with the galapagos .
we also know that not only be endangered , but they were equally vulnerable and other leaders .
now i want to show you that penguins are drawn into <unk> .
turbo &apos;s <unk> has <unk> , he <unk> his <unk> at the door . we &apos;ll go in and it comes in here .
and then another thing that &apos;s very comfortable is coming .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our basic political geography .
the two parts of a pretty long frontier .
again , like the vietnam war , china has <unk> russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
in fact , in <unk> countries , its <unk> china is reduced so that <unk> and cambodia can be sold cheaper , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> by <unk> to china .
what i want to show you is i call <unk> , day day .
these two arrows form a bow , a <unk> of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with gaza .
most of you .
so what &apos;s next ? what does the future of the european union ?
53 countries , and it &apos;s a half the suspects , straight lines on the map .
this dream is the ancient <unk> .
it &apos;s not bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone encodes promotes the growth .
so how can a hormone that &apos;s going to grow the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones that are active in <unk> circumstances -- in fact , in a good time -- when food is available to low , and if food is available to be low stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have a impact on lifespan .
and basically , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of that i &apos;ve been talking about , which is the <unk> of the worm , a different normal <unk> , like a bird , so that the bird is a bird that can live much longer .
they will never see an ad because nike wants to buy their shoes .
they all show heroes , who became <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to walk into a <unk> <unk> .
so this is a view of a lot of <unk> <unk> , like prozac , basically the chemistry of the brain , than if you did the brain of the tank of a chemical soup , as if the <unk> was the brain of the <unk> of chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague seymour is <unk> <unk> .
by the time , we found that a vibrant , a lot of a lot longer needed to be able to <unk> the <unk> again , and when we were the genes that were played in this mutation in this mutation , we could find a <unk> .
and this question has been asked for a long time to people , but we can actually test it in the fly .
so , the way that mosquitos find us in the dark by looking at us . they smell us .
just so you see it &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re going to be stung by mosquitos .
in <unk> , did .
and every time i was the <unk> look at the eyes of the eyes of getting a prisoner &apos;s prisoner .
and as you know , fat is one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
while we &apos;re talking about <unk> clinical trials , about clinical trials at the research of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have these angels in the world . not just in our country , venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if what doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i left the news over the street .
<unk> <unk> : what you &apos;re not about to know about the marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s actually better . it seems to be that we can make these receivers , using the material that is encoded in the dna that is encoded in the dna .
the animal goes , it &apos;s going to get its wings , it &apos;s got these , but it doesn &apos;t really pick up the fly because the fly between two <unk> is trapped .
for a intelligent nature like our fly , these rule doesn &apos;t be in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal learns as being learning .
so through many of these trials , we were able to <unk> the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , as you could do that , but we haven &apos;t solved one one example of how intelligent behavior is the physical behavior of the physical interactions of living in living .
here &apos;s actually , actually , or actually a <unk> of what &apos;s done .
ed : all right . tb : okay . so a little bit of a little more on the center of the time , a little bit more .
from their own experience , i know that the hospitals of young people can be a very dangerous place .
here &apos;s an image from my legacy &apos;s legacy .
one of the one i tell you , this kind of <unk> , which is all associated with their goals , is the <unk> that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health care .
they &apos;re not going to stick or <unk> or glue or <unk> .
here &apos;s the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you took the bottom of the ice cream and then it would be a <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
and so <unk> did . and he does this .
of course , of course , in a completely different way , you would see that in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say that people are going to work into the oceans and think about the goals , we should be much lower .
this is the vessel that i was with the last three months at antarctica .
if this ice is melting down the sea level , the sea is down to six feet .
what was the cause ?
in two cases , the bad news is the corals of the galapagos islands .
you &apos;re the temperature of the water .
but then you see the <unk> <unk> in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , millions of years of years we &apos;ve done it just with <unk> , but in this case , we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that asked einstein : to figure out how gravity works .
einstein had already been room and time , warps and <unk> , <unk> and curves to describe gravity .
but deep inside the structure of the room , the idea , could be the idea , could be more dimensions than we see there .
and just like the strings of a <unk> different different kind of different strings , the same threads <unk> in different patterns .
yet yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that might be able to explain some <unk> traits of the world , or can we actually detect these extra dimensions of the world , or can we show this extra extra dimensions ?
so we have two tiles with colored dots .
now , can the <unk> see the predator , what &apos;s going to attack ?
and what &apos;s true of sensory information is true to all the information .
and we &apos;re looking for 30 seconds to what a lot of a hammer is in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the brown , in fact , in the shadow , in the shadow would be the same amount of light on her eye , and it would be the same amount of light outside the shadow , they would have to reflect more , just according to the physics .
how do you know that ?
and she comes in the beehive , finds a <unk> and hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . insane , right ?
am you agreed ? yes ?
often there is no right or wrong .
in 2010 , in 2010 , in new york .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the threats , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks with whom we are faced .
think of cancer , bird flu , swine flu , sars .
there were no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> , by taking data to accept data that &apos;s going to reject the <unk> and <unk> the data .
i was familiar with another group , an airplane , to the <unk> , to fly .
this is the people that people .
and he was found out there at the time , at stanford .
they had good teachers with their teachers , students .
so let me ask you some questions about how that is a good choice . &quot;
i took somebody to get a <unk> , and i was able to save them , and i was able to raise myself as an undergraduate , but i found that nobody did something something .
we opened the first one in 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups were very often immediately immediately called &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a <unk> process that can deal with this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about the first time we probably ever see in the history of the arab world , a revolution from the bottom : a <unk> .
so the paradox is that the average decade was so promising , and it &apos;s made from one reason .
once again , the ngos , the ngos , the <unk> , they &apos;re not just the roads -- they assumed them in negotiations , because they were the victims of these guns .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man &apos;s man ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the <unk> come , they come right , they &apos;re just getting fantastic .
i &apos;m giving a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of radical things about how we &apos;re supposed to think about cancer , how many people are supposed to be thinking about cancer , which is a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics in the way you compare the genetic level .
and i like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good . &quot;
so we measured basically each <unk> as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them a <unk> , or some <unk> of it .
where we really have to get up , is the process that &apos;s just going on , and at the level of the most complicated activity in the way , the body &apos;s not even cure for the body , how it does it ?
danny hillis : cancer , in fact , is through
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people .
because at stage three , most of us are most of us .
that &apos;s their <unk> .
there was no plan . never before anyone tried something out .
in fact , martin luther kings was kings , in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and doing nothing . &quot;
and suddenly they got the <unk> out of the <unk> and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we think about the population of africa ? &quot;
automatically <unk> the little bits of plastic to the top .
these <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , which were designed to make the taxes on the floor for the floor , which they are , not as permanent buildings , they were not as permanent buildings .
she &apos;s <unk> the stability and the security that &apos;s a <unk> driver , compare them with the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> niece in high high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most energetic form of <unk> .
i can &apos;t really tell you , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like these , sign of these , are practical aid to a world that yearns for <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> of suffering that could otherwise be <unk> .
gandhi was a really <unk> person .
and the first day , our <unk> <unk> was invited us to fight and taught us our slogan every day for the last day to make the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of their famous famous .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without <unk> people who &apos;s not going to be deceptive .
so that &apos;s the world that we live in today .
and so i &apos;m going to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example of my grandfather .
okay , number two : go to the wild .
and imagine this , you &apos;re a <unk> image : i was born into a very small village in mexico , and unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no secondary school education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that happened that we &apos;re going to face today &apos;s incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s based on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
so we &apos;ve now sent 30 different technologists of <unk> in 18 different countries , and we &apos;ve been able to connect millions of people , trying to learn to learn what this particular segment needs to be market and demands .
and my father came to me , my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation you have to do better than the previous one .
i know a lot of people who are very smart and yet saying , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started to connect them together with another family .
don &apos;t you think that we have the responsibility to take the environment ?
i still go through the same four years as well as i did .
but this is not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
believe they don &apos;t , don &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what &apos;s you do in your hand ? &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s this in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball basketball and that basketball is represented by the identity , what you &apos;re doing .
when my kids were little , i always went to her room , sat down to her bed and looked at my children .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i &apos;m <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet , it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , each one of a different collection of 100 books , so that the village of all the village of all of these books have been around .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
you answer the question : how does it feel , realizing that you &apos;re <unk> ?
we &apos;re really learning this really bad lesson .
think of a moment , what it is for you to feel right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out what to do .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly <unk> book on a subject that everybody hate to the audience , that would never give you to .
the effect of course is not just <unk> wheat wheat , but mountains of grain .
in 1986 , she was from vietnam .
the answer was <unk> : &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank a third of the <unk> in our business , and in the five years of the dotcom , our <unk> <unk> has <unk> .
and bhutan , for the people who don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , first two years .
it &apos;s actually that we often hunt in the west , so the happiness was a little bit of something that we would have to capture , a thing , or maybe several things we need to capture .
and we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can manipulate the <unk> of production , by using the right conditions to live with our employees , so our employees can live their calling .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
and in the deck , you &apos;ll tell you the <unk> , you move you , but the eyes are moving in unison with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , you know , you &apos;re going up to the top ?
the way is : what did you do ? the results : what did you see ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and empower them to express them , and so you want to express this , so amy is the last word in this short history .
poor people have no choice of the election .
we were <unk> in the &apos; 70s .
and to get there , we need to recognize that the principle of a top-down is not only the other , but we &apos;ve talked about our society , but our society <unk> .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure someone of you &apos;ve asked , &quot; yes , great stuff up there -- but how do i get there ? &quot;
i was a professor at the <unk> of <unk> , and i got a lot of attention to the <unk> of the program that allowed me to finance the beginning of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they drop apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people ask , if you &apos;re safe phone cell phones .
you can get a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> cell phone woman &apos;s <unk> .
and for those of those who don &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s kind of a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where they &apos;re not going to be <unk> , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> of poisons in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , the <unk> death .
and i was only learned to see who he was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive , if you can . &quot;
even with that <unk> paper , paper in our hands , we &apos;ve always defined each other .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows he was defeated .
so to give you this to allow you to be able to put them back up to the driver .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people in , we put the buildings from inside , the <unk> , and we helped the first <unk> , for the first time , saving .
if i do this , i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m not the original details .
you &apos;re withheld by the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and what &apos;s democracy is , is democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country is , cut better , china or india ?
because the indian man has an advantage of life expectancy is an asset , two years of the indian woman .
and what &apos;s political in terms of change is they introduced <unk> .
so , in china , i think , still , a few recent principles -- particularly , particularly social capital , public health care , public health care , a sense of equality , which is not there in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now you have to have the problem that they spent all the money to afford aid with these advanced electronics in these countries and now everything is <unk> .
a little chaotic environment where probably many ideas arose where people are more new , interesting , <unk> controversies -- people different from different backgrounds .
so , about a decade ago , a wonderful thing was a wonderful called howard <unk> and i read darwin &apos;s notebook out of this period .
she <unk> himself with their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i haven &apos;t thought it was .
is it also the other way ?
in the 1970s , &quot; one percent , &quot; 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors are being summarized in the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; political networks , which help a group of good interconnected , but actually not good good for the rest of us .
while you &apos;re just quite observing the globalization and the technology revolution , the global sector is creating the global regime of the money , it &apos;s much harder to grade the whole .
so , you spend unprecedented amounts of time and tools for getting their children .
we &apos;ve created the modern <unk> .
this is his little hand .
we &apos;re going to die of one of them .
and that was a huge revelation for us , because we believed in a new development .
i think even in places like oregon , where oregon , where you can use , <unk> <unk> , only half a percent of people have ever done .
so , a long talk short , they come to canada .
but i heard about cancer as a most disfiguring disease of our time , how did the fit , so the good thing , and the bad thing together ?
some article went to say that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond that , not just against cancer , but it &apos;s not just the fact that they spread in skeletal muscle .
16 percent , 16 percent of skeletal muscle was , but only 16 percent of the real estate -- but only 16 percent of the real estate -- what <unk> is capable of control , the tumors that the tumors of control for the <unk> blood blood cell .
this is a very far <unk> idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl that the other in breaks the team for her team .
and the same thing that i wrote about is a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we went from the restaurant .
he had children from korea to live in korea , and he was doing families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , look , and see how blades , the <unk> of the hotels , the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , took up to the bathroom , and we thought it was the children and the children .
until the adoption of the adoption , a year ! what does it have been so long ?
this is their <unk> .
this is a sydney , in a few days , three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , which is the way that science is about to redefine life , as we know it , redefining .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
you see , as uganda , uganda and zimbabwe <unk> , russia has been on a percent .
they &apos;re going to have the highest hiv situation in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , the same rate as the united states .
look at the kenya here .
it could be that there &apos;s something else that &apos;s more of the transmission of the transmission .
we know that about <unk> billion people have ever lived .
it was not just an economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter way of time than it was in germany .
likewise , it &apos;s with institutions .
they have to eat me . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions about the future , in 2016 , in 2016 , if the united states is to lose its place as the number one economy .
no , we will probably be able to inject the giant <unk> that we &apos;ve collected , irrespective of the evidence that we &apos;ve gotten , irrespective of the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work and <unk> parts of our historical histories .
niall , thank you .
there &apos;s a lot of spider spider .
spider silk is almost entirely made of protein .
the fibers that make a single spider , are pretty diverse .
and also , <unk> have a high potential because of their capacity to <unk> .
what i &apos;m looking at is not the <unk> , as lovely as it may be , but the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there &apos;s more photos . there are more photographers .
this sounds <unk> in our ear , but what ended is happening is that 80 percent of the <unk> has a lot of contributed .
the first thing happens , if you &apos;re a problem , the first goal of the institution immediately is that the goal of the world is to be <unk> by the <unk> .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there &apos;s people in the states that are trying to figure out whether or bloggers are journalists , or not .
she was creating it by creating their <unk> , which is the use of many of these tools , <unk> , no job intelligence in the world today to the attacks of the attacks .
you have a <unk> , which is probably the most part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because <unk> is made of fibers .
everything is in his place . first level .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s take a look at the different steps , under the <unk> of the possible connections -- my search is about to be the answer to the answer , &quot; what &apos;s so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re really shaped , they go back to prove to prove that they &apos;re alive and they develop character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of grain from any of a beer .
it will be a kind of <unk> while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these conventions , and i &apos;m working on a piece of a piece that &apos;s been <unk> for a bit of the hundred pages , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i <unk> my hair .
it &apos;s being demonstrated by brian <unk> , who is an extraordinary artist .
so that &apos;s a little <unk> of the piece of the piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my graduate students , and i -- we put the babies two bowls with eating : a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a bowl of <unk> .
i mean , last time , when we take babies look at the babies , they seem pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the <unk> is bringing them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : so that .
our consciousness is being extremely bright and vivid , and everything else is going to be like dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and <unk> of the human species , &quot; the <unk> <unk> . how babies study <unk> information , and how babies are taking <unk> information , can make information .
if i could just give you a quick demonstration , just to show the difference -- because it &apos;s quite trivial .
and then you repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly and again until something comes out of the <unk> -- in this case , the figure is supposed to walk .
what we really wanted was the whole human bodies .
so you can &apos;t do this .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes of how he came to it .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it anyway .
some of the other studios we use to do exactly the software to do exactly , and we &apos;re going to see some of our <unk> <unk> in a few big <unk> .
we thought that it &apos;s just the balance that would be .
here you learn to go to the <unk> -- like most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i will never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , you write a new york times column , you get hundreds of emails , and most of you are getting hundreds of , <unk> . most of you today .
but some stories are just a classic , but it &apos;s so understandable .
it &apos;s <unk> . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new blank document in word , you might be able to make it !
but i think there &apos;s actually two <unk> <unk> .
the other products were being supported by microsoft &apos;s standard , rather than apple <unk> standard .
and <unk> , if someone writes a <unk> -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; let me , &quot; let me . &quot;
but when i looked at the latest technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the <unk> kind of digital technologies made me very much worried about the <unk> .
and to cut the risk of these new things , we need to eventually limit the ability of individuals that are basically given access to <unk> .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re standing at -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to create these <unk> <unk> with the back of the time that we &apos;re going to make us draw from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you <unk> , you have all kinds of unbelievable properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of the last little fund , and it &apos;s <unk> to 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s a pretty remarkable .
and if you &apos;re the concept of <unk> , you can create a lot of <unk> &apos;s citizens -- the state of the market -- to deliver feedback , to deliver feedback .
12 years ago , i started to love , and i was <unk> my research in this direction .
wonderful and <unk> things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface of ice .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
so , it &apos;s actually so much energy in biology to have a large number of <unk> <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that have many properties that have been a lot of traits that people used to be used for the habitat and other organisms .
whenever you <unk> a goal , to his own , you have to get to be taken off , and they &apos;re going to be taken off .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> were made about it , and it was suffering under extreme <unk> .
that is , before we could start digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the way , by the electron with light , they &apos;re <unk> .
and that was a bad idea , because <unk> of <unk> had a son named alexander the great , and she lost the battle of <unk> .
because the moment that <unk> is <unk> with <unk> and so much more .
the original owners of the bottle was a most <unk> <unk> of the 1700s .
i asked myself : 160 dollars for what ?
it has four balconies .
a <unk> scheme is that many of these things are coming from japan -- you &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i could not get into the finger , and that was the olympic 47 .
and i can &apos;t -- call them my taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not necessarily great that i didn &apos;t really impressed , but i was not the only one that i was there with , this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid was sold for <unk> to <unk> real dollars .
and what &apos;s really interesting about virtuality is that you can measure them .
well , i could develop a game with the name of a <unk> , and you have to get a million pies , or a thousand pies .
when it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and tragic is in it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , so in 1999 -- gave it a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how personalized engagement can be transformed through the psychological and neurological insights that we get to see when we &apos;re watching people playing .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> called <unk> as a <unk> .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there is a hunger hunger hunger , 120 million people and almost <unk> million children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30 anniversary of <unk> crop and the big <unk> , by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> in america and change the way we &apos;ve been obsessed with agriculture international .
this is a <unk> that i received two years ago . that was one of the biggest projects i &apos;ve ever had , and i had the company to be involved .
but i &apos;m going to just just talk to the beginning of the process , three very <unk> .
if we &apos;re so good , what we do is we shouldn &apos;t be able to be able to create an architectural manifestation that &apos;s perfectly just <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> bottlenecks ?
the architectural controversy was , <unk> , simple .
and this is the actual reward .
the second technology we used to do is we &apos;re using things that you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> of the opera .
here &apos;s the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to collect stories , and it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
one of these projects is about a year and a half .
these are the images that automatically created .
so as long as i was awake , i had the camera to go down .
you can see a timeline , which shows the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , on the way , on .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> farmer .
what if you found a truth , what would you do , what would you do to do the next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money deserve and a business open to indian india was .
while she was the anesthesia of the anesthesia , he told them that he was going to be about <unk> of death .
don &apos;t make me wrong , writing it .
so , the hand is almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then is limited communication .
very funny people , if lol is that .
you don &apos;t get in the <unk> .
if anyone had seen a black board from the beijing , the <unk> had been a little bit different for the time of &quot; love , &quot; but he had understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i &apos;m going to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work next week at the whitney , and also in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan is not an existential threat of the global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> of optimism bias .
diplomats dig in <unk> .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we were in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success was to be part of the great part of our humility in our humility -- in the <unk> fashion , in the <unk> sense of our <unk> .
rory , you know , it &apos;s going to end .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you what it looks like .
there are also <unk> , which are <unk> , but if you &apos;re <unk> these <unk> , these are used to use a different type of <unk> .
the <unk> . that &apos;s a hard problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another , very interesting connection , and this is what you want to do is valuable information more information about a general <unk> that &apos;s a general <unk> .
so , i think it &apos;s the minimal foods that we can possibly do to make things .
and we decided we should not think about it as much as the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that says , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> with kansas ? &quot;
so we have to wonder why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t interact with people who are not as much as you are .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only half , if i say you will no belief in the hospital , if you &apos;re missing from a missing missing <unk> , mri and <unk> <unk> .
and then bell starts to his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , early 20th century , the doctor &apos;s physician , who was trying to make a diagnosis , a diagnosis , the photon .
between the perception of the patient and the physicians of the patient , the health care of health care is a real contradiction .
another experience i did in texas , before i went to stanford , i was influenced by stanford .
the bad news : the precise cause we don &apos;t know . can you see ? you can do that .
i remember so many giant , <unk> , <unk> eyes that ritual me .
some call us <unk> , a more <unk> word .
in this case , we have the <unk> .
so for you , here &apos;s the way , &quot; well , this is a miracle .
and there was no way to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
harder is it &apos;s harder to move to one answer .
my friend simon &apos;s <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , wrote the big bang , &quot; and so on , and so on .
and so you open your eyes .
you can open it up , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it &apos;s got me excited about this guys , at least most of the people , at least most of , what they do for a living .
all thought that was impossible for impossible .
you can create any amount of change in order to make roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need everybody .
hugo <unk> has <unk> the <unk> and <unk> class in venezuela , and he &apos;s only led them .
and so it goes on .
they connect people with each other .
the reason this is taking modern medicine is a 60 years old .
there &apos;s a catch .
that makes it <unk> <unk> , over 600,000 times cheaper and over 400 times more <unk> than our <unk> counterparts for pancreatic cancer .
my experience with the islamic world are quite different .
there &apos;s an <unk> , <unk> .
and why does sex make sex , and why does babies make a erotic disaster ?
because there is the secret of desire .
so , especially important to the description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in desire .
this is her <unk> and <unk> , that &apos;s biology , the natural instinct .
and then , the desire , this is really , curiosity , curiosity , <unk> .
you know , there is a real <unk> space that belongs to everyone alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s actually played in smaller rooms .
so early <unk> , some <unk> <unk> .
so i wondered , ok , is this a model for design , that <unk> that we do ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me , and he said , &quot; that stands up !
how do we solve the next three problems i want to bring to the language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m committing to somebody at somebody when i was talking about a speech , and i met mr. einstein .
what about life ? why am i here ?
i &apos;m never reading a speech or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rare has a so powerful spirit with the <unk> of jesus christ . &quot; &quot;
or he was , what he was saying .
i &apos;m not going to talk about the <unk> <unk> .
but it &apos;s about to sit about 10 minutes and you take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i never had in .
harvest <unk> .
and i said tears in the eyes i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman stands in president <unk> and says how she and siblings , her brothers , her parents died in war .
we go in rural areas and everything we do , like this , is what &apos;s happened in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look at 20 years now , and see that there &apos;s another girl girl , a <unk> girl , <unk> girl , <unk> girls on this stage .
lg : love .
licklider &apos;s how computers realized computers can do the necessary to make insight and make decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your credit , your computer , and they &apos;re a lot of data and we get to understand the opportunity to make our sense more deeply .
this record was human <unk> .
by a <unk> process , what would be introduced to a task for 40 people over three months , and it was a simple assignment for three people in 40 hours . all are the <unk> <unk> .
we should stop seeing out outside .
dinner with my wife and the children are driving home .
because people say , &quot; shit boy , i don &apos;t have time to become a time .
she was a much larger dog than i thought .
these impact all of us affect us .
the <unk> of the national state is <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
think of <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina , we have more common .
and they all have done that , and if you don &apos;t , you will be , you will have to .
help me make green in the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive map for my mom .
but i &apos;m a skeptical about what these <unk> are .
in this case , you take a <unk> , put it on a pile and the pile of <unk> , the behavior of different characters , in a game , in this case , in a big fish .
when you learn to code , you can program to learn to learn .
when kids build projects like <unk> these projects , they learn to learn about these kinds of variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a context of the car , is the idea that automobiles are art .
so i want to talk about this .
and i think that this thought is that great cars is a soul , very decent , and you all know that . you know , you recognize a car with the heart , you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> that &apos;s really going to be our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided that it was cheaper , instead of a studio and six or six to <unk> <unk> house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to each other day , we were going through the <unk> threads , and we <unk> the concept of true , and we <unk> the concept of true nature of true creativity and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring it to boston .
because i just have a little lab .
we &apos;ve now been clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we have no team of <unk> and <unk> that we can rely on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you think about is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the one hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why the entropy was ever low .
unlike low entropy of early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to you , we have a good theory that &apos;s going to explain if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy is .
and therefore , although the universe lasts forever , and the ordinary matter of being more and radiation , will be <unk> , and then they &apos;re giving a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in the empty space .
but there &apos;s also big fluctuations .
it &apos;s not a <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of the universe that you accept and not challenging .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i could not accept .
now i want to throw something out there , like me , say to the african and the poor people who dream with their dreams .
no matter what a movement i was doing in my real world was <unk> by my little device in the digital world , and eight years ago , eight years ago .
i took this very literally , i took my <unk> , and i put him a little bit of a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the camera is actually not only my motions , but it &apos;s also able to understand what things i think are in my hand .
and why just <unk> ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you saw is about my learning is about india .
this is juan <unk> , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio , june of june .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down under the ground to build a subway station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year , we have these terrible <unk> .
we &apos;re under average in terms of the average city in the city .
a city of the future is a city that has no idea of this great community , which are cities .
the best answer is to try and reconstruct a darwinian <unk> of our artistic and <unk> .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that they <unk> kind of <unk> , so they &apos;re making joy , they just take it to look at them .
and some are in each case too large to use them for battles .
our very strong reaction , to the expression of feelings in the arts , the beauty of music , the beauty of music is going to be given to us and our offspring as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see the computer , and you can see the <unk> the environment , and you can &apos;t see the <unk> , <unk> leds , so it &apos;s actually going to see what &apos;s happening .
see if you can avoid <unk> .
or for blind people , in a traditional <unk> , in the household , in the training , education and the office .
a little more subtle <unk> . the <unk> , that normal people don &apos;t listen to voices and i heard them , but that was not that something that was not true to me .
my mental <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , sing and <unk> and <unk> , and i was saying , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , she &apos;d better be more than cure cancer is easier to cure . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> : if the social change begins , it can &apos;t be <unk> anymore .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through right now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars should be more powerful , even though mars is a very much more powerful and interesting place .
and the common astronomers were full of contempt .
because the way that the way that the way is that life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to the life on a planet .
there was another object , this high <unk> of these creatures and <unk> and naked -- pretty <unk> things for a young child .
the first projects were modest , and they took technology and they took technology and turned them into things that would use people to use a new kind of kind of function , and maybe a new function would find .
the other thing that &apos;s the <unk> is to <unk> that we decided to <unk> the whole gadgets , all of this stuff , and tried to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called <unk> water . so that &apos;s another example where it happens in a room in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the development , the development , it &apos;s all tightly intertwined .
this is my <unk> anthony <unk> , switzerland , he had the laptop for one afternoon , and i had to take him back again . that was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects , the stories tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly <unk> and brilliant woman , was a <unk> widow .
she was the <unk> <unk> of the women i &apos;ve ever heard .
look at these young girls who come back to school after the <unk> in their faces .
the world that sparked layma was given was a world war .
then the situation is going to be .
they need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation that grow up in a world where everything is <unk> and in some of our best conversations on a screen .
ultimately , it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if you wonder , why this is at all interesting , you need to look at the rest of saudi arabia because it &apos;s a land that &apos;s very close between the blood winds .
maybe some of these things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : in turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had to call something that i call <unk> , which was to protect the universities , against <unk> students .
if i think the only person would be like that , then we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims europe , they were independent europe , they were independent .
so the e.u. process was the e.u. of turkey , the efforts of turkey , in turkey , in turkey , and <unk> of the <unk> nations , were against some of the previous nations .
there &apos;s a very big nose that &apos;s not going to seem to be <unk> as if you &apos;re connected to something <unk> .
if scientists are today , a century later , to make neurons , then they &apos;re lighting up to the inside , rather than they &apos;re going to make them .
carl <unk> : glimpses of the inner part of our brain
but this is a trend .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague of mine , &quot; the <unk> on the tuesday , was at the right time on the tuesday , was the right time to start the genocide on the <unk> . &quot;
and instead of having the opportunity to put together , local leaders and international leaders were coming to , and they get distracted by the second <unk> , the events of the <unk> , 2001 , and the wars in <unk> and in iraq .
<unk> design requires a powerful focus on the <unk> , <unk> thinking and <unk> and <unk> .

<unk> <unk> <unk> , the great journey began .
some of the mammals went back to the water .

mo <unk> from canada , from the u.s. , and the u.k. <unk> us and we called ourselves , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we had lucky , 450,000 <unk> <unk> . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men of being involved in every age is so critical and important , and i think that &apos;s as much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what his forest was going to happen , because his grandfather took him under his <unk> when he was just two years old , and he started to teach him about the forest and the way of life of his people .
when i thought about , i wonder what our grandchildren and our <unk> would be responses , if you ask the same question .
we need new models of a leader and human beings .
they work with people like <unk> krishna .
life long , through everything , above the cultural revolution and everything that came to , he gathered , he gathered up , so that he &apos;s about eight million parts of the art museum in his museum , <unk> history .

&quot; my world is subjective .
or maybe he was just a yogi that was sitting on a rock and the sky , and the sun &apos;s <unk> , and the moon .
and if you lived an extraordinary life , you get to get into the <unk> , or , as the french call it , the sky -- the sky -- the sky of the <unk> .
and so it &apos;s got to be great rituals in which big <unk> <unk> and for 10 days , and for 10 days , <unk> ...
see what is business , because other outcome of the behavior of the marketplace and the behavior of an organization ?
you see , this is india today . the <unk> of reality is based on a <unk> view .
you know , he &apos;s created the largest <unk> of the largest <unk> , it &apos;s called &quot; big <unk> . &quot;
&quot; why i chose this way , why not care of procedures , just get me , please . &quot;
<unk> <unk> opens the eyes for a new view of india &apos;s central india and the west -- shows why these <unk> systems of the <unk> , the <unk> of the death and the <unk> of us with the <unk> and the <unk> .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world to say , &quot; i &apos;m completely competent , &quot; meaning , even the worst <unk> of failure .
what interests you is compared to what ?
your friends and family will come to the <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a tombstone , on the grave , saying , &quot; here &apos;s an excellent engineer , who invented madness . &quot;
they &apos;re <unk> . this is the conversation that mothers and dads are supposed to hear , because their child is good at math , and you know what comes next to you .

we bring this physicists into los angeles to see what they &apos;re building .
mill &apos;s mill .
they have slept in this <unk> .
that &apos;s a <unk> vision .
it &apos;s a question of consequences .
so let &apos;s get to the point .
what did i do ? i &apos;ve heard my belly on my belly ?
that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s a different way to think .
the <unk> is basically a visual thing of a human being , where each portion is proportionate to the surface , which is it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll .
i did just make it money .
thank you .
and he said to me , after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , <unk> , whether people don &apos;t find her throat , as my videos . &quot;
this is the reason i &apos;m using david edward , a scientist from harvard , an object that made the toxic elements to absorb these plants .

he was a really interesting sight .
he went back into the second floor , and he said , &quot; hey guys .
so like mcdonald &apos;s .

economists talk about game theory -- that every game for two people has a <unk> game .
<unk> is skydiving with a board board on the feet .
<unk> at the high level of being able to spend the step , if you &apos;re taking a step for step , if you &apos;re really hard to work harder and mentally .
ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
occasionally i meet with scientists .
so i had the hope that i had a bunch of natural elements , a little bit of a fog , a bit of a fog , i could make the space tangible .
<unk> means that it makes a difference if you &apos;re not doing something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are less .
how do we create an idea that is <unk> to be <unk> towards the <unk> , and without the two in two different directions ?
i spoke about new kinds of <unk> , one animals , and they &apos;re attracted to <unk> .

here we see neurons .
so this is the important thing for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is : if i &apos;m looking at a different person , why am i not <unk> , and literally , literally , you see this sort of <unk> of your naked watching how someone touches ?
thank you . i &apos;m two missions today .
i &apos;m not actually about the <unk> of the <unk> , but it &apos;s about the pollen .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> by the outskirts of kew of kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell us the <unk> .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign , to address this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980 , when we &apos;re women and death and death and then , wrote an article for the new england journal of medicine , called the <unk> <unk> of the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , x-ray , <unk> , women , whose <unk> are the view of the heart , every time we &apos;re going to <unk> something that &apos;s just a small amount of radiation , asking , &quot; is this a test ? &quot;
okay , here we have .
they &apos;ve done what they said they were <unk> , and they &apos;re leading to the campaign .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish , they don &apos;t have to kill them .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours a day , took about a <unk> hours of <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> that &apos;s been held a little bit more than a year ago , which was really surprised .
and then finally , my son is going to be in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy and <unk> roy are here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamics in the game .
this is the first time that our son was going to be more than two steps in once -- captured in the film .
and this is an important question , because the better we understand how the brain is generated , the better , the better , we can communicate , and i think the better we can think of ourselves and work .
it &apos;s a center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh , i have a powerful or emotional response to that . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is our teams <unk> the entire teams to paint on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just <unk> , but it &apos;s about the possibility of relaxation .
so , don &apos;t make it .
if you translate that in the industry industry , if you have a <unk> and you crushed a window , you &apos;ll say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s broken .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;re going to set up .
are we just stupid ?
you can be more than <unk> , if you read eight hours a day .
so it &apos;s <unk> to the september , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m important .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why do you do that ? &quot;
and the police wait to the door of the firemen , to cut the vehicle into pieces of pieces to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present in the present , in the united states , in the face of the divine , a eye of the divine .
all of that leads to -- <unk> , just to name the time , that what we do most are using digital devices .
this is the implication of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side by the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the healthcare system .
he would then held my jaw in the right position as he <unk> my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and quotes , who &apos;s fascinated with the <unk> , if he &apos;s <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> that can see the <unk> , or a <unk> , or a paralyzed .
now i had to go in the dark years , and i was able to figure out what was that , when all this was particularly , was gone .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : if you have the opportunity , spend the opportunity to spend simon .
and these were the developing world : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this page . a large <unk> of africa and the world &apos;s great <unk> .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought it to the land again .
a search is that we can copy the data into a <unk> form and we can post the data , and what are we going to do when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin &apos;s life explains how it was born , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned how francis crick .
but there was a lot of literature in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was unhappy ; i was not married , my girl married me .
you can see the microbes that compare dna to the world , and you can compare them to .
and so i close off by saying that we &apos;ve got 20 people to have schizophrenia .
in an average , it costs the defense in one case two million dollars and it takes 18 months when they win .
first , they &apos;re not fighting the patent , but against the patent troll .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to leave you with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; , asked the girls .
the fathers were in a place where they &apos;re moving their daughters to play their fingers , their chairs and their hand to reach their hand .
that &apos;s a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
you can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and so they needed a different approach to eradicate polio as we had smallpox , when we had smallpox .
it helped to control pandemic pandemic <unk> , sars for instance .
the reality of polio nowadays is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the hardest places ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio going to gridlock in a gridlock
dj : we found this <unk> right now at all sorts of animals , especially with the cats .
and then our surprise was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many ways , in many ways , a symbol of inspiration , is a symbol of that hope that &apos;s been accompanied by our work .
it was incredibly amazing when she took it to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at this <unk> , i think it &apos;s a <unk> , she reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because their fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we need to keep on .
but after all , it seems to be obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun is small and mobile . but it &apos;s worth what <unk> <unk> would be like .
and that &apos;s because there &apos;s always been there in middle world &apos;s space .
nature of the model depends on what kind of animal we &apos;re .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because between you don &apos;t have a consensus on your <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the way we see him in middle world , <unk> and <unk> .
people as a machines to treat , and <unk> , but it &apos;s a <unk> of a time , but it &apos;s a <unk> of time , if you want to guess what the question is going to do next next to do .
i was at the night at the time , at the time , at the time , at the time , at the time , 40 years old .
so i &apos;m <unk> with a <unk> , i allow these <unk> to take video to send video from the robot , and i &apos;m using the buttons in a <unk> .
and with people like you can make this dream .
in the suburbs , for example , a <unk> is designed to evolve the <unk> &apos;s lexicon , basically , the <unk> that &apos;s extracted the dolphins .
i think together , together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
now there are some of these -- there are some lessons from this .
but we don &apos;t normally do this .
i think we &apos;re looking at this way , the infrastructure of globalization .
this is 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to do .
i also assume that most of you are not chinese -- what &apos;s really sad , if you think that this is really sad language on the internet .
what &apos;s looking at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why should i care about this ? &quot;
but there &apos;s all these different techniques that allow it to be out to look out and find the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence overcome and make sure countries never <unk> terrorists , <unk> terrorists .
and part of that is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war , the 20 million people , who took 20 million people -- until today &apos;s the most civil war .
<unk> sen , who is this guy , &quot; i have a whole set of money , but i &apos;ve spent all this time to look at the american man who had my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken that began in fact in new york city in the early 1970s , when i started to , at the university in new york city , when i started to finish at the university in new york city in the early &apos; 70s , and ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century , the <unk> search for medicine is the same thing .
so people would have a really big <unk> .
when the <unk> started to become less , i was always <unk> , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
remember , as a child , you have to go to each line ?
18 and 19 sleep at 18 and 19 sleep .
and again , i &apos;m going to get a little <unk> and something <unk> .
so many of us is clear that it &apos;s a lot of doing a lot of , in the next few years , in the building of a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel , &quot; how does it feel ? &quot;
you know , where did work . where did the world do the famous problems of the treatment that we have made from the potential of conditions and climate change ?
if you <unk> the impossible , you can do it .
but we have a agreement to change climate change .
and there was crying .
the <unk> power is something remarkable : they &apos;re using two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their competitors to create a material that is extremely hard to do with technical fibers , comparable to the technical fibers .
or you &apos;re <unk> beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture the camera .
here &apos;s how it &apos;s taken off by the tissue .
and with my new project , i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to dismiss and the <unk> of applause and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him make some of his closest decisions .
what &apos;s i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this unprecedented demonstration , heather , heather , heather knight , a <unk> , who can be a <unk> , and the feedback of his audience and how to be the feedback of his audience and how to predict the thing ?
stanley <unk> , inventor of the famous <unk> of <unk> , emphasized in the <unk> and <unk> that there are two people in between two to seven steps .
how does our view look at all of these relationships ?
there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might be told me , and i could have that bug in the ear .
um ... my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility , and despite his young age of others , of 17 years of age , and also his guilt , he was a <unk> , and he was from a camp that was left out of a camp while his friends were left his entire life .
and as my <unk> and my <unk> , i thought , were <unk> , and he had <unk> my father wrong .
i asked him , given the victim , the victim , he had to have the <unk> .
we &apos;re growing by a couple of millions of people to seven billion people that are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , which is a <unk> for the next <unk> .
if you <unk> the forests , the boundary of <unk> exceeds the border of the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> the capacity of the <unk> , stable .
with the knowledge of <unk> , fishers , the <unk> great barrier reef <unk> and scientists , that great barrier reef is falling below the current , in the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , is that the <unk> change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today , because i really like a media .
this is a <unk> of a race of <unk> .
first of all , it uses a age-old kind of making the <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technology at that time .
and by using sugar , sugar in black <unk> , i made portraits of them .
and it was very large images , and i took them with a very big camera camera , a camera camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially at worse <unk> , very far .
so on the back , a sequence is the same one .
so we can ask questions : there &apos;s general differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people .
so we can ask ourselves to be the same questions , as we have a neanderthal , have a <unk> of people &apos;s people &apos;s people &apos;s mixed with people today ?
there &apos;s a lot of people who designed their own vision , for example , so this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane is the airplane of his own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> growing in 3d printer , and are embedded in a <unk> area , and follow the forces that occur in its components .
they don &apos;t speak . but , but , most of all , they were remarkable isolated from the world around them , from their surroundings and from people .
they would be <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you have the sense that the research that you have is really busy having a effect on the reality that you can actually prevent these experiences that i could actually prevent that experience that i started to have on this area .
then you drop off .
<unk> <unk> you <unk> yourself on a rigid position -- chin , and your chin is the arms , arms up above your <unk> .
they did everything exactly as we had taught them .
and after the battle , they &apos;re going to ask these mobile phone , and what you call &quot; <unk> &quot; to teach you what you &apos;re doing .
people have changed .
i asked , &quot; where is he ? &quot;
that &apos;s not a <unk> .
and she showed up the left to tell me how the problem was , which was the image of the <unk> , which was represented by the idea of the black and black represented .
it &apos;s really in the sense of the <unk> , that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m doing .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how are we supposed to do this . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you deal with you before you &apos;ve decided you &apos;ve got anything ? &quot;
their <unk> increased to 50 , which is new delhi , <unk> <unk> , <unk> biotechnology .
76 percent . the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted lectures , he wanted to be <unk> da vinci .
these are <unk> .
suddenly i looked at the dark , on the <unk> side of the time , a <unk> of mirrors that were held by the moon .
if i have to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some snippets from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest -- the storm -- the storm is the storm .
and our little lives ends up in a sleep .
bono : &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that &apos;s acting on the intersection of health and business .
let &apos;s take the markets as the <unk> <unk> , which we have , and figure out what price people would pay for it , so they would have the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother could not understand it , then we could not use it in the video .
we were destroying two <unk> and 10 tv tv .
the little <unk> of it , and it &apos;s going to take away from its tracks , and that was a problem .
this is good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models that i work with .
and creating tissues from <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the key to use these models for the <unk> .
thank you .
and the attempt to fly it to the point of the attempt to shoot an arrow with the <unk> end , and it was hard work , and boy , boy , boy , boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect to nature .
now let &apos;s take the other side .
we work on projects -- even <unk> developments , as <unk> <unk> -- with darpa , california institute of technology and university university institute of technology and university .
be careful , as they just behave like wood or so , you know , like wood .
now i &apos;m not trying to be <unk> .
they go forever .
that &apos;s about two billion .
it takes him to estimate about it , &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one of the time you &apos;ll fly .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for time to be able to live in the human mind and machines can win together .
i have a clear mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s the fear that could be held in the wild in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence of the evidence that this cancer is going to transmit from a virus .
i took the opportunity to get true , and took some samples of jonas &apos; tumor , and some specimens from some of the parts of the body .
she brought him to the vet and this discovered something <unk> .
and ultimately , cancer is a <unk> consequence of our cells to share our cells and adapt their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for waiting .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation isn &apos;t happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that they &apos;re <unk> on them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken , if we &apos;re conscious of this <unk> .
but what we then see in the 21st century is going to be <unk> , which is incremental to be more than half of the world &apos;s population to do over half of the world &apos;s population .
you could look at this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after the vietnam , the soviets had sputnik , it was : &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re living in japan or new delhi or <unk> , your view of china &apos;s going to be something different than if you live in beijing in beijing .
and if we put strategies in which we &apos;re going to get into a wider historical context , we &apos;re able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests , so it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> yet .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this is typically the responsibility of the peacekeepers that has a stable <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re in the long time .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after the law &apos;s law , you can &apos;t even get any land done .
the market would be used by the conflict , government , government .
this is the contents of my hometown of new orleans .
the military is what it &apos;s called , and they call the climate change a <unk> , security and stability as governments , as governments in the world debate , how to respond to the world .
it allows you to become more productive , so that you can afford to do the insurance to the time .
these are certainly inspiring solutions , if we feel in the situation , for a sense of <unk> world .
listen to how chinese students are teaching english to them .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect .
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , abstractions , that we &apos;re trying to make sense of the way we &apos;re trying to make sense of the way , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , so we &apos;re more likely to be what we might be as what is .
luria looked at people before they <unk> into the scientific age , and he found that these people are resistant to a taxonomy of the world .
there was luria , &quot; the north pole , is always blown snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it was not just the spread of <unk> <unk> .
would you deserve it , killed ? &quot;
you could say , a <unk> .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they <unk> me to do a degree in anything .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifice , this film <unk> .
i &apos;m one of her <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all mad at them : &quot; why do you do this ?
this is a lot of real real time you read him . &quot;
we had a game over school for weeks , about weeks , about seven weeks , and we had <unk> all of the 50 of them in the general world .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced <unk> jobs and <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like its own little connection .
if i put all three legs of it , in the three quarters of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> app -- this old <unk> and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; -- this old plastic <unk> -- this <unk> is very simple in an old <unk> .
this is possible , if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> paper -- you can be at school , or in a government school , or in a government school -- a leaf , a ruler and a pencil , no no way .
what we &apos;re doing is a very simple <unk> .
that &apos;s a little straw you &apos;re doing is this one two <unk> of this two <unk> here , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
here &apos;s two magnets .
it was very numerous on the ship , and they got bored , so they got bored , so the captain would be her , and they turned it off .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> gupta , <unk> gupta , but the amazing plans of junk to turn waste into really <unk> , good , constructed toys that are learning to the basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually the examples of biology that was held a lot of evidence .
and there are some examples of projects that are really quite important to imitate ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can be a place of transport of transport , into a turn that offers an open space for people to connect people back to food and waste and waste in opportunities .
this is the photograph of the day that i took a year on the day , and just a year later , looked like this .
if you <unk> seawater , the first thing is <unk> calcium carbonate .
no , you have to <unk> the people living downstream with visions of the other . &quot;
i looked for somebody who &apos;s jewish because i was jewish , and because i &apos;m a very important .
but the actual <unk> was that there was very many men who wanted to date with me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with itself .
he &apos;s like , as long as it doesn &apos;t be on a <unk> .
i was trying to be the principle of being <unk> .
because remember my favorite <unk> : you have to get a <unk> of 700 points , and no one does .
most of them . <unk> are the average of the average age , not eight years , and if we look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of tomorrow &apos;s older older adults .
imagine that their vision is very , very good .
these <unk> have actually many other benefits in attention and a whole aspect of attention , which is also improved , and it &apos;s also improved , and our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
i want to ask you about to remember this , and to put it in the context of another group of <unk> , a group that actually looked at the very community that &apos;s really looked at the society that are made of people living in the world .
so let me explain this one step with a task called the mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
so let &apos;s just let all kinds of programs of the special case that we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project , which i &apos;m not even sure was , if it &apos;s all works .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its kind of precise , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> , able to do a lot of a <unk> <unk> , which is a lot of them to do a few lines .
so with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to go to the world and see that certain technologies make sense of certain kinds of problems with certain technology and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited at the discovery that there are candidates universes , which has successfully <unk> , and <unk> relativity and gravity and the general relativity and what we give the mechanics of quantum mechanics and what we have on the mechanics .
sw : i think .
and while that time , i actually lost more of relatives , and teachers who have me fostered hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a right thing to land , and automatically anyone in the family , anyway , my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony we were dancing , was excited , and all night , didn &apos;t slept .
he was a <unk> , and he was in a village that had not even <unk> roads . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl girl , i would come back and do everything that she chose to desire to me .
if it was pregnant before the marriage was pregnant and was punished in the mom and <unk> .
as we speak here , we &apos;ll never get <unk> girls again .
consumers , the <unk> , the <unk> , actually , actually , are starting to <unk> the banks and companies pay back to <unk> , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> <unk> , himself of taking the risk of the <unk> itself .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually <unk> and the principle of education , the future of future children are <unk> our houses .
<unk> is to have 48 percent , according to the following institute .
we also observe a trend to something <unk> . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and then , more and more , the neighbors as a support .
we &apos;re also seeing a big <unk> .
the <unk> is immense .
so we &apos;re going to take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got the question , i &apos;m the only one that does this ?
you could exploit them .
so that &apos;s what i do about my life -- stories are writing , novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and some of these supernatural creatures that are <unk> .
our <unk> could be shrinking . our hearts could be stunted . and our <unk> could be <unk> , if we keep in the long time within the cultural <unk> .
i met the first time i call it &quot; the same as i call &quot; &quot; rare . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no <unk> or <unk> . i &apos;m asked , but the commute between languages allow me to invent myself , <unk> myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of mine .
my tiny story was a huge issue , because i was prosecuted .
literature has to be able to lead us to the other side .
i could get a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that &apos;s going to be a happy story . and in my next book , i &apos;m talking about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you get to get the other songs of the songs , you &apos;re just going to cut down into little bits , and you can give them together , and you get a new song , but this new song is clear from old songs .
instead of using these laws and laws , the laws of the <unk> are rather <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to sum up what it covers . <unk> eliasson : the <unk> of the telephone , by the way you &apos;re putting a symbol of your fingers .
our creativity comes from , not from the inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but what &apos;s you see ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s the guardian . &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb , a kind of <unk> <unk> , <unk> that &apos;s <unk> from the limb .
our study of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
so this led to a understanding of the atomic structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single nucleus with <unk> , which is the only one that &apos;s going to circle around .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think you can ultimately <unk> the <unk> ideas for us to <unk> our place in the universe and really the value of our planet .
this is . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and every click , every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to see how <unk> and <unk> <unk> our personal information all the way through our way through the digital forest .
when our daughter sat down at the <unk> , i asked them , &quot; is it going to be much value on musical competence , put on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t <unk> this <unk> .
now , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so troubled , i was speaking so much i was talking about my 27 birthday , i &apos;m not going to talk about it just a day for a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ...
and i explained to a friend that was my sign of my sign that i was john francis was that i was running through my life that i didn &apos;t speak and that last time that someone would be translated to was my name language .
well , i &apos;m <unk> my backpack .
i started talking again because i was <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was thinking on every birthday of my silence , but never about my decision to use my decision to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried that i was going to give me back and sent back to him .
i felt so powerless because i had gotten so much food in america , but my father had died of starvation .
but i think that your gesture of love and also the lives of another of the others could save thousands of other wine and can transform thousands of other modes of <unk> that still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much more powerful than i expected , and make it easy to make an industrial <unk> and make a industrial <unk> .
but i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich people , the government , contractors , the government , the government .
and then the following year , 1995 , was there a big earthquake in the japan in japan .
so i wonder what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , nor in the womb .
so what fetuses are actually learning about the particular language is going to be spoken in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it &apos;s a combination of what &apos;s kind of relevant and weird as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition in the womb of disease ?
but you can also see <unk> with other eyes .
this is the <unk> in the <unk> &apos;s <unk> essential .
the audience are going to <unk> <unk> , which are quite logical , but not with the match what is happening in front of her eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you may actually get to smile .
you may remember this as the <unk> <unk> , okay , at the time , as the greatest deal of all of the time .
if you &apos;re a high animal with the <unk> and somebody says , &quot; what does your mean you are the <unk> of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad app ?
this is a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue , that strategy is a role in a part .
for me , all of the music was .
now , if i use my software , the camera &apos;s camera , and he &apos;s <unk> the spot of the <unk> in relation to the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a whiteboard .
i remember the poor things that needed a little bit more <unk> -- eat , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t had .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now , i heard him speak , i was excited for various reasons .
i was not even asked a donation , which was my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about to give a chance to give you a possibility of what dignity would be , a partnership , a partnership , a traditional kind of <unk> .
it &apos;s a very <unk> combination , a very powerful combination .
now , at the moment , it &apos;s still quite a very beginning and it &apos;s kind of <unk> to me , it &apos;s very clear to me , it &apos;s just a vehicle , only a tool .
what &apos;s the future of humankind ?
now , i turn to the second big question : are we alone or is there are other life in the universe ?
the answer to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
so you see this .
here &apos;s photographs of myself .
the rate is doubling every 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> white , that &apos;s the <unk> law .
but what &apos;s with you ? what is it going to do with you ?
they float around the sky across the sky and occasionally take people for the <unk> of trials that their parents would not agree with .
so we &apos;re interested in things for these things .
and so , older generations could not do these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was <unk> millions of years ago in the form of <unk> million years ago .
we can learn a lot of them .
and i can see <unk> and try to protect my child because you don &apos;t leave with a child , even a minister of no <unk> .
and second , she tells us that she had a <unk> gang , but some <unk> <unk> for the <unk> trees .
so far , our knowledge of our ancestors , basically , in principle , the fossils , because the fossils , they were missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> studies of humankind in the world &apos;s origin of ethiopia . he talks about how he &apos;s found the oldest skeleton of a spontaneous child &apos;s first time , and what we can learn about africa is about our human experience .
and if all the rules are supposed to be , you need to have an effective system for the <unk> and <unk> system because we &apos;ve found in the <unk> of all the control of knowledge .
it &apos;s going to be the high seas because the continent of <unk> <unk> except was except .
we need to work locally , but also the whole yeast <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
so , i think that &apos;s a pretty good idea .
and to say , i &apos;m a journalist , i &apos;m a journalist , so i &apos;m not a sketch , and i &apos;m going to design a sketch , how the present and the future will look .
i think i think we all need to think about whether we want our reality -- and if what it is , is what it means for our idea and everything that comes out of life , and for everything that comes next .
it looks like oil oil .
the symptoms of complex are that you think the strong and <unk> opinion of being the right solution , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and earning a lot of money .
it &apos;s an example of the american race of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and try . probably everything goes wrong .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
<unk> was trying to do it again , but he could not prove the world .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is not sustainable .
china wants to have reached that in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s going to be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to be pretty soon -- certainly -- in safety in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s coming out of us .
and here &apos;s what they &apos;re going to play .
and what we need to think about is this : when you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed that we are going to put this debt up to our children , but it &apos;s going to be you .
everything else is <unk> .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what &apos;s the one of the cell &apos;s development .
this is not an amazing thing ?
all we have is <unk> .
you will be able to focus your mind , maybe the sensitivity or a series of things we can &apos;t do .
this is not a thousand years in the distance .
we should outlaw these cheap , simple <unk> , and nobody &apos;s going to use their kids to use . &quot;
and here we can see this as a result .
we can &apos;t be risking losing the trust of the client .
he &apos;s only got 500 and could have to get 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a giant jar of <unk> , who she got , and he said , &quot; come on a week when they &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things that we &apos;re all talking about -- is more less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine is that we &apos;re <unk> now , a human brain , if we look at the rate , we &apos;re going to <unk> six billion years of <unk> six billion years .
now , it &apos;s not that -- if you do a table and stuff at work , you &apos;re not going to be part of the web , but you &apos;ll be part of the web , but you &apos;ll be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the distributed kind of machine . &quot; in a certain sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want <unk> .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
thirdly , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second <unk> <unk> was turned on , that was the sun was <unk> moon , and i was being prepared for god and prepared to become his <unk> .
these are the dead dead of <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes everything logically .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , like we line things .
this is a project that we just completed in <unk> for a giant <unk> that came right out of this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that are going to evolve .
and that led to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset because the more likely is more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas do the math for the process of the day young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of you is about his neighbors .
so as we have to do , we have to pay for numbers .
so we have a big brain , a great advantage because we can impact our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a <unk> brain .
and these <unk> is very , very important , because there &apos;s <unk> .
we &apos;ve learned to talk about the big brain , taste tastes and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , someday we were all like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who are still 250 stars in the sky .
of course , the <unk> of the <unk> and the told us that .
the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , is actually a <unk> , which is constantly to reflect the light , which appears to be reflected in the sacred <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
if you pray for the dead , they do with the hands of these gestures that they &apos;re in the sky to the sky .
here &apos;s where the big mother the <unk> in the world has been the mountains that have created the mountains and the country in the country , they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique human imagination .
this material you all know is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic white stuff .
i &apos;m going to throw inside , you know , because in a hundred years , my body can go back without a drink to the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of <unk> or <unk> , because you have to take a different alternatives .
first of all , you start atoms in a particular bottle .
i was a competition called &quot; dancing your <unk> <unk> . &quot;
my country is about 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- -- that &apos;s a lot more than all the speakers in front of me and all the ones that come to me .
and she thought about my work at mathematical models that should be encouraging evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not like <unk> -- it &apos;s a deep , cultural reasons they &apos;re bored -- and find another more interesting kind of interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think two types of thinking about it .
if you toss a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to the more secular secular , because of that , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing with uncertainty .
and only one percent of it is wrong .
he <unk> : &quot; i guess that after one of the death in a family , the probability of death in a family will stay . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but it &apos;s quite unlikely .
the entire quality of the world , the impact has been on the industrial operation , is supported by statistics .
the <unk> has saved hundreds of thousands of lives , globally .
an intelligent receptacle of preventing preventing the electricity is , because the electricity is being realized , until a intelligent <unk> recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . a notion of <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;ve got facebook , we have <unk> .
but the <unk> itself can create a very powerful force , which never existed in history of china .
so , chinese is the same as proper as proper as the medium , not just as mere meat .
now , what a great ted , isn &apos;t ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> really changed , they made more and more transparent , because they have no access to the data .
more chinese and more chinese speech and human rights as their favorite <unk> , rather than one of america &apos;s privilege .
many of you know that beethoven &apos;s ninth was a <unk> .
i don &apos;t say that they can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can be quite nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like that was the <unk> away to try to find the death of death , which is the sound of death and his skull is being <unk> and his skull on the side of the pages .
cl : joseph &apos;s phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i <unk> myself , in this <unk> audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
and at that point in the dutch history , my father was the <unk> river in the <unk> river river in the face of <unk> river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has gone down since the cold war .
my soldiers use their guns as a result of peace .
peter van <unk> : why i took a gun
this is a shape , and then it &apos;s got to get 250 strands of dna .
this is a <unk> <unk> in <unk> , in the middle of the vietnam .
you can &apos;t let &apos;s not be fooled . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in the very first .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of giving you , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical argument in the way that technology evolved in <unk> .
now , evolution took thousands of years of thousands of years , and because of these interaction , evolution used to basically use the technology of the technology species , to bring the next stage , which was the first step in the technological world .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can exploit a good dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the <unk> percent of the year in the year .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
so to get back to our exponential growth growth : 1,000 dollars on computing is a <unk> of the brain of a insect or a mouse .
and the year , we will get the full <unk> of these trends , and they need to teach them how often the <unk> <unk> was made of technology -- faster and faster , if we get to those point .
you can make blessing and <unk> .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing inside here . well , it &apos;s not there .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that &apos;s in conjunction with <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we call schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post that resolution and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought of a little thought , you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> on the african .
the 11th of september 11th has got a <unk> . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own <unk> , and we have a <unk> product .
i was not as good as he did , but we did , <unk> n <unk> , <unk> , tracy tracy , <unk> <unk> , and that was a great experience .
they used to say , &quot; the truth &quot; and we said to us .
musician and activist peter gabriel discusses his personal motivation , with the <unk> <unk> for human rights and stories of active <unk> .
next , we wondered how to do that ?
he recognizes the problem and know it &apos;s being done . the dance is his <unk> , which allows him to be able to engage in the <unk> .
the beetle &apos;s blood , much less rarer on the pill , if you throw in some <unk> when they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our <unk> experimenter .
let &apos;s play a <unk> and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to fall into these great adventures , not quite quite with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s next year , a <unk> <unk> .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of the presentation of convince the vc is that they &apos;re entrepreneurs in which they invest and make a lot of money to make .
and next to reason , a business service or a business company -- that doesn &apos;t have to be business .
there are no business leaders in which there were no problems of problems .
from that , they take it out -- on a solid , very complicated way up to the end . right from the beginning to the end .
if i know somebody who &apos;s made a device that &apos;s made of this device .
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick <unk> .
even when the competition is , the <unk> patterns works ...
it was hopefully all positive , positive , positive , nor positive .
if you follow my hand , you &apos;ll have a <unk> , very poetic presentation . that &apos;s great to <unk> who you are and to teach emotional .
i didn &apos;t know that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically statistically a bug , a bug .
if you imitate something , you might have a impact on it .
and then if you have enough enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , in the last place , as the culture , the innovation doesn &apos;t estimate .
as we think , and we behave , our <unk> , <unk> .
we have a <unk> meme -- serious .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very <unk> .
our thinking is backwards .
through a <unk> change , as an example , such transparency , such as <unk> , for collaboration , and collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are being made , the only way that we &apos;re going to get rid of the old <unk> , and to get new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and if we do that , and the ideas we &apos;re sharing is to turn a few of a better .
the magazine for <unk> is , i believe , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master &apos;s master me , because the <unk> was at the time that was at the time .
after i had <unk> them with a gesture of the dance , they were very -- i was accepted and i worked for six months .
nine days ago i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we <unk> multiple magazines , did our homework , but where we looked at these pictures were surrounded by images like this .
this image literally passed in seconds after the baby was placed into the arms , and i brought it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : don &apos;t talk about his miscarriage , but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general view is that every aspect of my life is better than i was getting more of the time since i born the wonders and family .
but you &apos;re finding out that you &apos;re <unk> to lose control of great in a wonderful way , what we mean , our life is very much sense and what &apos;s extremely gratifying .
rg : <unk> + thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen this &quot; star <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine big , big , already at the time , you know , you would have to hear the same thing . john <unk> walker shows how digitized footage can be analyzed and analyzed it for <unk> wings .
now , we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest , the longest , the longest , in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , i think , a few months of people like to go to the <unk> apple without <unk> , and as someone could have <unk> , their insecurity , they can &apos;t hide their insecurity .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a <unk> man , a little chaotic man , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
but interestingly , the future is a future where society <unk> a few of the <unk> capitalism of capitalism , namely , how to integrate the dna &apos;s <unk> innovation in society by trying to figure out those things , and those things work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new findings that i &apos;ve been working on , about the relationship between the structure of language , which they &apos;re talking about , and their propensity for saving .
and if i want to talk to really , force , i think , is constantly thinking about it .
well , that &apos;s a unified theory .
so , you can see this device so that you can stick with your <unk> hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in the exchange for the future .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability is to communicate through generations .
we english english constantly have time .
but i &apos;m about to use it as a bar .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time , i was at the field of <unk> medicine , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> .
people and <unk> and <unk> and birds and everything that goes up , and these are people , livestock and pets .
we &apos;re focused on this <unk> model of the future , produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this is the last night i flew around the party , and you see , you can see how it just <unk> , and you can see any <unk> you want .
and he was a little bit of a time , like the buddhist religion in india at india .
and he subsequently subsequently returned to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re all right . we take the feeling of memory to a mother and a large , and a large thing in these creatures .
and you think about how neurotic things are when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re satisfied .
and of course they are cruel and <unk> to others .
although the change in your mindset are something that causes other beings , and they &apos;re feeling these new quality of data in you , and it helps you to do it , and they serve as a role model .
so the cup of cup is the cup of <unk> , and the cup of being able to get tools for the society to get the public health .
interestingly , complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple , as you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> , an example and two .
and i don &apos;t want to stop at the bottom , but in the bottom right corner , you see an example of what we have .
have you started to do that ?
and what comes out of that is that <unk> of what we &apos;ve talked about , what our new kind of organization is , or better words : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will be less capable of being less in the use of the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be in collaboration with the <unk> .
so let &apos;s take one example , which yochai mentioned mentioned .
also , it &apos;s also <unk> , professional arguments .
so it won &apos;t be an argument of two planes , but between these camps , there will be all sorts of interesting positions that are being taken off by people .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to devote their <unk> to someone and actually , a team of the new zealand and spain , and then the spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for him .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people call the people like this , and they &apos;re leaving news .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman to true , to true my body . &quot;
and the one that &apos;s not made of a <unk> , so that it turned out to be a different town and took a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior based on everything , from genes , from genes , and <unk> , to the <unk> .
and also some of you have a few of them . and it &apos;s the gender .
this was one of those cases , because there was no violence under their ancestors , but my father had already been .
they &apos;re like , they &apos;re like , as you can only be .
by the way , i get an email tomorrow , which is that we &apos;ve done this last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that &apos;s most known to be the least .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why nuclei together , you should be <unk> , using a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that you &apos;ve got -- you know , dna has the shape that you &apos;ve got .
the comparison is that the people in this room are the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really so that with this theory that seem to be the physical <unk> at the time of being able to see , and a perfectly wonderful prediction , the model has not been done with the goal that it &apos;s happening , but it seems to do it .
they made this civilization , this beautiful image , the darkness of the light into light , and it allows it to see the civilization from all of the way .
another big insight came from a survey of wayne university university university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the <unk> <unk> player looked like the baseball <unk> .
in a similar trial in germany , researchers used to measure <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and after they had <unk> <unk> on the face of the <unk> .
&quot; because the colors that you &apos;ve inherited , not the european standard of being , &quot; he replied .
&quot; safer ? why ? were there more policemen ? &quot;
we built the light out of the bright people people who were to think about , and they were to think they were traveling to v-day , when they were <unk> to the cause of their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; sure , you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it . &quot;
all over the banks , entrepreneurs and <unk> <unk> for mobile phones .
an amazing one of the world &apos;s overall power is happening in kibera .
by 2015 , there are three billion to the world &apos;s health .
in the shops of the environment , <unk> batteries , batteries and bread .
this flow of time is embedded in everything : in the <unk> of a <unk> , where <unk> is the <unk> to the rose .
read an interview with a writer ?
and as you look at the great bear , i remember how i was a kid on his head , and i &apos;m not going to highlight his head to highlight his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen again how creative technology can be and our lives and we can choose those solutions , innovations and moments , the flow of the time that &apos;s not <unk> the flow of time , but again .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee camp , they had to <unk> soldiers , who was the nine brother , take the nine brother and take a soldier soldier .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want , out of the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> because i don &apos;t <unk> my emotions .
thank you .
almost everything is all life on earth &apos;s life , so they were <unk> by five .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why would that matter ?
so theoretically , we can grow each organ of some of the same organ in some of the same .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the bottom line .
if the rotors rotate at the same speed , the robot is just floating around .
and you can see how robust control is .
and he does that , while he <unk> obstacles .
they &apos;re taking their neighbors .
this shows that we double the <unk> , triple to triple , triple the <unk> , and we can actually make them to make teams as a team .
but the robot can even figure out where he wants .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much so much , and i want to expand the horizon , and you will change your way , change your way in honeybees .
this is a huge problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , the <unk> of the <unk> , the many different viruses , bacteria and <unk> with themselves .
they don &apos;t experience that .
so the chefs take control for their dishes , and the honey -- there &apos;s <unk> -- they &apos;re using the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying , if they stick , they didn &apos;t want it .
okay , now , now , i think the question is : why is this ?
of course , we have also , especially in the last decade , done the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before that many people were not aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread was not an european invention .
and especially the meat <unk> in <unk> and china is <unk> up the <unk> .
<unk> has been <unk> for most people , and there &apos;s not many farmers under them to be bad , to be bad , the environment to clean the environment .
all of it is together .
and so while i finished my bread , i &apos;m going to <unk> it , and i &apos;m trying to burn it , and i &apos;m not trying to burn the hands .
and also , it has to keep in the land for a long time , and that allows you to be able to fix materials and <unk> .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyze and testing , and developed a new technology , and i &apos;m creating the quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this today , a new relationship with nature .
this was a couple of days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur turned a film about her , <unk> queen , who you see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is <unk> as a burglar .
this is a <unk> patient who was at the back of the moment -- he needed to get a bypass , but it was the same thing .
i like this slide because you &apos;re talking about what people really motivated to change people &apos;s motivated , and what not .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans are even more fat because the more carbs , and even more carbs , but the actual number is lower , but the actual number higher , the goal is to reduce it .
one of the <unk> studies of research found that 70 percent of the people were clogged , 65 percent of the people were <unk> , 54 percent of the people who had no healthy food .
on the other hand , everything is that intimacy is <unk> , <unk> .
i hope it &apos;s not .
the film is based on a <unk> <unk> scott <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to come into the <unk> and technology .

it &apos;s even very <unk> . if you look at it , you don &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells protocells .
so we see the self-assembly of these bodies of the <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black <unk> of these black mud represent these black mud , organic black <unk> .
in his lab , martin <unk> <unk> &quot; protocells , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , how living the living cells , his work , and how life could be done to life on the earth first ...

the white dots are the ones that are protected by the <unk> .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> places .
maybe there was a <unk> there .
it &apos;s so much powerful in science and visualizing and visualizing these images that are coming to see these pictures of the <unk> .
and we &apos;re currently seeing a really dramatic level of magnitude of it .
so i don &apos;t have to go into that .
you can &apos;t leave the pristine , of course .
this is a <unk> building .
so an example of that we all know is that the cell phone . right ?
and it &apos;s all about that question -- of course , in a very artistic and environmentally invasive way .

he <unk> him the cash , and of course , ray <unk> six months later , the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re using the experiment of being used , prints from <unk> images .
we collected our materials , went out in the room , and they were waiting for half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were two pictures two pictures , and they had two beautiful <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> for you for the meaningful things and we said , &quot; what would you be ? &quot;

it &apos;s pretty easy , but it was a <unk> .
people are <unk> over two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the <unk> of the new york city that i thought was very emotional .

but they &apos;re all the market &apos;s market , and what the market is , is number one is the great demographic of demographic , and the big demographic <unk> .
we also found a lot of examples of dead boxes that have been transformed into all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .

as i said , he &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the most remote cases and order to be able to do the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mom went with , while the soviet union was .
and if you think it &apos;s no longer , it &apos;s not enough , until you go to further .
so what i want to try to do is to make this happen .
and what i &apos;d like to point is to point out about the presentation , 50 percent of the u.s. population is under the ocean .
it &apos;s because the photons are not the average depth of the ocean , which is the <unk> miles , the <unk> miles is down to <unk> miles .
and so we went along the <unk> in an area beside the <unk> , and there &apos;s the missing heat .
so i started developing a new <unk> <unk> with a <unk> that replaced me , and i don &apos;t need to go into my vehicle .
we &apos;re finding the <unk> .

but i would give a child without a <unk> control control .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is just hard to access .

in particular courses , you can wonder what they &apos;re <unk> and how to help the students are helping to fix it .
we actually see the beginning of either personalized <unk> or <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe and what my first thought was what infinity means when i was a kid .
and of course , it &apos;s mostly about to make the reality of the other people &apos;s reality .
i have my doubt about the value of influenza science science , like , for instance , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a <unk> .
so you can understand my surprise when i was reading the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , claims , ayn rand , <unk> rand his <unk> .
i think you can do that kind of funny ones that have not been , and not about the reason that i didn &apos;t have , right ? i &apos;m not going to jokes about <unk> and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;m a really <unk> at the same time of the <unk> , which i tell you .
he said , i &apos;d better pay him for him because it can take a really good <unk> to be good to become good <unk> .
huh ? yes ? what ? i &apos;m not going to hear you . &quot;

many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he <unk> the time that an experiment with a particle accelerator could be wrong and a dose of a dose that was destroyed the world .
we need to be able to do the same thing as a <unk> , and then we need to be <unk> .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about it ?
and now the worst thing comes .
we spend a lot of money on it , making sure that we don &apos;t die at a <unk> , but we &apos;re nearly not there . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be caught again at the wrong foot .
i hope that will be .
it &apos;s very , very important because this is the system that came to the system of life on the planet , and it &apos;s time to understand it at the time , to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only known for recently that .
and that &apos;s what the system <unk> , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles , in these circles .
anyone who comes to come after it is , just taking the database , and you can recall the information that &apos;s needed to do , for anything , what &apos;s happened .
we &apos;re at the same time to take the wave , the technological possibilities .
so on a earthquake , large amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that are our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and a <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s going to cause the <unk> world .
so i think optimism is going forward to move forward .
so again , radical is about conservative .
the <unk> against the <unk> , you know , often wants to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , are always unexpected .
but i rather play something completely completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than the same time that it &apos;s <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> .
risks from rooms that were never supposed to be as <unk> as they should be in a very challenging city .
there &apos;s the emotions of the victim .

and if you bought this capital , and you put it in the <unk> , and then you put a monthly <unk> on the roof , and then the <unk> <unk> a monthly <unk> rate is down as the electricity station .
we almost failed , but we &apos;ve got to go across this .
it &apos;s like a jet engine .
how to do everything in the world could be a person <unk> ?
look at that .
boy , if you <unk> our livestock and see a cheetahs , like the goats of the goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we &apos;re suffering from starvation .

and we &apos;re hiding this price behind huge .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> have been passionate the <unk> revolution for eating food .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
the science sees the world through how much things can be measured and be described , but they &apos;re <unk> , but they give the art to knowledge and knowledge .

this is the natural cycle .
this would not be a <unk> photographer to <unk> a photograph of this , right ? but sometimes it &apos;s got to be able to show the dimensions of the dimensions .
here you see the glacier back , pulling back .
this is where several cameras saw .
could india be the origin of innovation , right , or a global center for innovation , just as it &apos;s become a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?

i said , i know a <unk> message , if i see one .
everyone in our society comes with cancer -- if not personally , you know , you guys , by one beloved people , a member of a member , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material is the chromosomes inside of a nucleus .
we have a tumor tumor treating fields over about 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect on all of them .

in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up so right .

and i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , an early critic and this is one passage i just love , and i &apos;d like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , mother nature would have a problem : how to do everything in the world , we get chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part of the hardest part , which is not obvious , and so i went to the end .
okay ? stop . that &apos;s going to take you .
i don &apos;t know why there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i think in fact , the <unk> probably are very many reasons why we want new things to want to be very , very quickly .
it &apos;s <unk> that look like this . you should see things like this .
bob mckim &apos;s a different -- another version of this exercise made in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that time , you get a lot better , much more creative results , if all the rules are , if all the rules are .
and suddenly , there was a very productive conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll go back to it .
you know , as it feels , it feels all these insecurity , as long as you leave in the corridor , as the doctors in a <unk> case , you wonder , and you wonder what &apos;s going on .
and it would be safe in that that would be secure , and we would have a good time , because we agree about the rules and that would be agreed with it .
we do everything for success . but then if we &apos;re there , we &apos;re going to believe that we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re bouncing to just do what we &apos;ve done , and just listen to all the things that succeed made us .
i was faster , but as much as depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh , my god , &quot; i hope , &quot; i hope , the last time in the public .
he made sure everything fit .
it took 900 people out of part .
and the second is that the people who seem apparently experiencing a actual connection .
these are questions .
as you see in today in modern liberal democracies , the community is allowing us to determine the state of us , but it &apos;s not for us to shape our own , but it also asks us to do it .
it means that we will fulfill our full potential as a human being .
so these are the layers that i wanted to run them today -- the question of that -- what are the intentions that come to use when they design something ?
so i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> us , that we have to give better ways .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;m going to give you one fall in the fall .
he <unk> them in the right position , <unk> them with his nose and <unk> .
we learned the first surprise .
there was some kind of <unk> to create a lot of force to create a lot of force and speed that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load is a load of forces , and that &apos;s actually a <unk> load cell inside .
this is the <unk> -- there &apos;s the heel , and this is the heel , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> and on the load load .
a very , very <unk> solution for the special problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s the ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical <unk> that ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> , which is just going to benefit a three-dimensional space .
now look at that -- he &apos;s just making me stand .
the submersible was out last year , and this is this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , excuse -- i &apos;m sorry for the obvious example -- isn &apos;t the right approach to you .
basically , new york is built on the back of the <unk> , our streets of their streets .
in these eight little <unk> , chambers little <unk> , which will practically be <unk> .
so you walked around in london and was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
and finally , snow , snow has a map of the eruption .
and this is happening every second week .
i took her portrait on the top of the temple .
and in this area of the amazon , it was discovered oil .
the other side of the area is <unk> <unk> , where actually is supposed to stop osama bin laden . that &apos;s <unk> .
this was one of the great <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me move and show you the hubble valley of deep field .
but then you get jupiter and 40 minutes , and that &apos;s a problem . it &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be the part that we &apos;re going to understand the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that appears in the image of a matter , dark matter .
when you saw this image for the first time , you don &apos;t have much to see much .
this simulation was a <unk> for 1,000 processors just a month to make this visible .
with the <unk> , we hope to be resolution , which is to be the <unk> of the earth , which is actually the complicated pattern of the earth .
and we &apos;re all stressed out of course .
forty-seven percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re all the time , even in the world .
i got into a cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost nothing more .
so i wondered , could be creative , if you &apos;re going to tangibilitate the limitations ?
this is not happening in the morning .
the <unk> is <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , and there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> famine , the 1930s , killing millions of <unk> , and in the 1940s , she looked at the nazis , the nazis , were <unk> , <unk> . many women at the time they were born after germany .
that &apos;s the <unk> line . &quot;
and as a filmmaker , i think the idea most of the most important thing we had learned in the virtual world about how to use and use our identity , to live to the real world in real world .
we used to be used to be a new way of being in each other .
human relationships are <unk> , messy and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
because at the moment , in the moment , in which people alone are alone , even for a few seconds , they &apos;re getting <unk> , they &apos;re panicked , they &apos;re going to reach out to an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in jeopardy because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently we had won &apos;t be the <unk> that some of our graduate students had predicted , and quite often -- -- pretty often , i felt that they were <unk> , they were given their predictions on the financial form .
maybe , because my father &apos;s always read at night .
so i went to quiet them in quiet -- but i was very cold and nurtured it .
and i ended up thinking of a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time , looking at this time .
although you lose , no fear of failure , if we &apos;ve got <unk> all , because who can give you all of people to ask , and who can give you to give it to the people that he &apos;s thought of .
if i &apos;m supposed to call &quot; name , i never know a answer .
i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge was cells .
today in many clinical trials , different kinds of cells are used to be used for heart disease .
just last month , it &apos;s been able to have done this technology , to show the creation of human rights .
and we can map them and turn around 360 degrees and so the kidney , and then we can take this information and scan it using a information , and then scan them using a <unk> of print .
i couldn &apos;t get high school at school . i was dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to -- i want to do this . i want this surgery .
you may notice that a new area is called the <unk> .
and connected to these <unk> <unk> , there was examples of a president of a president , and the election from the <unk> wikipedia and everything that was in between the power of a lot .
thirdly , <unk> , <unk> issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want the music to play it .
i &apos;m a name of joseph and a member of kenya .
we need to <unk> our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late at night , i was driving home with batteries and ice .
together : anybody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s master &apos;s <unk> and working in full-time employment .
this is a huge amount of spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for a number of hours , the <unk> of the <unk> work of the city .
they have <unk> , charts and data .
so these are the 18 minutes that were introduced to me to speak here to speak here between two and <unk> people who are supposed to be .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> sludge .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things are scattered .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i was part of a technological revolution that would let this dream will be true .
think about it . these men who have no same <unk> as i was , helping me , help me get involved in their own support , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
at the time , <unk> was just a <unk> <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and used to use a machine that could be able to read a machine that could read every <unk> .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , in the different english , different versions of countries are going to be different versions of the u.k. : u.k. , canada , damascus , and new zealand had to have different <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> . life has more than doubled as much as the average , and it &apos;s increasing increasing at a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . people &apos;s people like me luck , okay ?
secondly , the new machine age is a good news , because when the hell of the work work , we don &apos;t need to do that , and we don &apos;t need to do that , and we <unk> the drudgery and <unk> .
the societal challenge of these inequality should be <unk> .
the economic playbook is surprising to be surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , particularly in short .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with adaptive technologies , embedded in a slightly more collective society and supported by a economy , living inequality , and then promotes inequality .
over the course of the years , i became increasingly <unk> with this notion of god .
some have a few have a god belief that we can only share with our pain .
the second is the line of the wind , the wind and the waves of the wind and the waves of it .
so who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the &quot; <unk> soul of the universe .
by looking at the god inside . by drawing my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things i started studying was the history of the <unk> technology .
we have no <unk> found that older than 40 years were , and the average age of this hunter-gatherer tribes and the prophets of the <unk> are 20 to 30 .
our bodies have used to use these new food .
so this equality of energy and matter the invention is shown , and also the modern science of <unk> shows that entropy and information and matter and energy and energy all together are a long dimension .
this is a robot that wants your own plug in to get more power .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking at a new job .
a great development that started billions of years ago , moving through us and continues . and our choice is in the technology , is really at the force that &apos;s much more powerful than we &apos;re going to .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five grade 30 to 40 students 30 .
we took that down , and we &apos;re dragging beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had this appearance -- as we have , as we have , said , &quot; you know , as the hull of a ship &apos;s ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the table and have been waiting .
there are many <unk> . the only problem , specifically for the adults who work at work , which was really exactly what they had was a toilet .
the teachers that we work -- everything else is different for teachers -- they &apos;re telling us what to do .
about , about 170 tutors , with them , and this is how wonderful works works .
and right there -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right there &apos;s a little chain -- right there were like children were taught .
there &apos;s also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf , which you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re in the <unk> , but it &apos;s slow down .
he &apos;s <unk> . he gets his cousins .
he gives him an email , he &apos;ll ask you any question you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that &apos;s thought that peace is the end of the fight , and there &apos;s one side that &apos;s thinking that peace is creating the creation of schools and creating jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one thing that &apos;s manual to complete <unk> , did you know ?
on the cape cod , there are <unk> roads , and we all can drive here .
that &apos;s my baby <unk> . thank you very much .
he was basically , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt badly .
so i encountered this kind of complications .
i found that these cheetos are very good <unk> .
college is at the university , so number 10 hard to do .
and of course , in a strange <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is a window , to the moment that the street was turned on , and the <unk> <unk> there was black <unk> , and those white <unk> were there in the sun .
and i was being amazed by the great presentation of karen armstrong reminds that religion really understood nothing to believe in the way , but do not have to do with behavior .
the <unk> has seen geographically , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like that , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> of an area , <unk> of one area of the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed developed .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the <unk> to change our political culture .
so this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have is through the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a couple of images to highlight a presentation i want to point out of this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
the rca is really an extraordinary school .
and we &apos;ve been discussing this morning with keith <unk> , that many scientists are not going to be able to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as a stupid <unk> .
here &apos;s examples of being able to print in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that lets us think about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit more .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge of that we had to ask as a physicist .
we can press it up . the forces more more than you , but they &apos;re <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> .
&quot; <unk> 7 &quot; <unk> &quot; a whole band .
and there &apos;s some of these people in foundations that call this <unk> .
the idea of justice , which shows our life limits and gives us a sense of what &apos;s really real , what is really just in life , what we should do , social justice .
and what &apos;s like that , he &apos;s <unk> as a <unk> .
so every week , the <unk> will come in . &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection , or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> call the &quot; .
we treat them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- the frankly , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now , you get a sense of how much of the time we &apos;re talking about how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was in 1908 . it &apos;s not . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him from the back line from all right . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called &quot; deep impact , &quot; which is a part of the <unk> in the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like me , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we can have a <unk> and choose , and we can change our future .
at that time , i led a <unk> , the only independent , to be right , the only electronic medium in the country .
and i thought that <unk> is surviving and a great business would be , if you had gone first , was just going to be the right thing .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it doesn &apos;t work , you will never see your money , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s okay , we meet , and we &apos;re going to take it out of your business business with what they actually did .
see , we &apos;ve been looking at the east and <unk> with our work , and they went to russia .
after a while , we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve created the idea of making ceos , pay for the open press .
and this is how we do that , in the funding , there &apos;s no <unk> , no blind , running around .
so why does this work work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some of the things that &apos;s a theory of everything .
so just one example is this : newton found the law of gravity , the way that the one divided through the square of the <unk> of the <unk> objects .
the more you have , the more symmetry you think is the simplicity and elegance .
one thing that he thought was most of us , most of us , but not at the time , that was not for granted .
it doesn &apos;t matter the meaning of this fan of knowing that they follow the laws of the laws and accidents .
but he was reading every time he had , books that he had books .
by this ambition , he went back to the <unk> .
but when he was at the same time , his signature was under the <unk> and was <unk> , because he had been <unk> a thousand hands on her morning while a <unk> foot .
not surprisingly , it was just three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , ever as i was older , the more i understand , which was an incredible privilege that was like to have the aging lion , so many hours spent so many hours .
and as lincoln told the story , all the war went to britain .
i asked my father down , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what &apos;s the reason for that is that i always think that i will be grateful for this strange love to spend a life in the past time that allows me to spend a life in the past .
he had the temple in <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the proof of the jews that the jews in the back of the exile , after all the years they were in the harbor to sit at the memory of jerusalem , that the <unk> was allowed to go home .
all these are being respected .
the <unk> cylinder is the priests of the great <unk> of <unk> , used to be written .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of living jews come in the world of tehran .
some of you know more about the ethnic living conditions , but they &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re <unk> .
the newly <unk> babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not touched and they were able to get them to try and find out , and within less days , they were <unk> , and they &apos;re starting to the air , like everyone else .
one study shows that 10 percent of a cost of a cost of cost is , whereas <unk> is about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i was almost my entire life in front of a camera .
you know , you know quite quickly what you do to find an answer .
there were <unk> people -- most of them , most of them and family .
we heard each one of each one .
but of course he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many meetings i was excited that this guy , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it was made , and the other , he was able to bring the elderly to the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones that believed in peace and on his possibilities , etc . , etc . -- and they made it really .
we combine with <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; at london , this is the <unk> .
it &apos;s about their <unk> , around your business .
the biggest brains of the world should be cognitively to be able to do the cognitively .
i <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> of the origin , but i could never do it .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , that &apos;s exactly what our ancestors probably invented a year of a year ago , and they discovered the cooking .
quite simple approaches to the <unk> conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m standing at the beginning .
but once the fights , the <unk> was subjected to be exposed .
behind him was a child , his son , red , his father to shove his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and i was talking to my boss in the headquarters in the headquarters and i said to them -- i &apos;m sorry -- i said -- i said , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting to do a few hours a day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two teams of the <unk> started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; yet , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but also in the streets of people .
and you should see me as a <unk> .
and this hospital could have afford <unk> .
why ? because the way i had was banned , was banned .
but i learned something more than that , because the leader -- the manager -- the manager of the economy -- the <unk> of the economics -- absolutely bad decisions that were brought to the economy on the collapse .
because i knew that the state of african continent is to be important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience i had to get to the swarthmore .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from which one great society can rise within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s the yellow yellow ball , the <unk> ball very much -- the sun that we draw as a children .
in fact , this is something that half of you , more than half , not be familiar with .
32 <unk> pills <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is arguably . &quot;
and these are the messages they convey to you ?
because , in effect , the sponsors , the sponsors , and so he gets them to watch tv .
a professional <unk> that speaks to dead , she doesn &apos;t get me ?
what &apos;s a <unk> ?
we want to have suggestions to people like <unk> , <unk> and community communities , so they do something .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often on a generator &apos;s generator .
there &apos;s got to give something better . &quot;
but the way that the user control is , whether it &apos;s just stream or not , because they can steer the <unk> on the ground , how much percentage of oxygen you &apos;re giving on .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can provide hospital for hospital .
the various ways of writing in africa , the first was <unk> , like the writing <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society of the <unk> in <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , as a <unk> , john <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> b.c. that were <unk> in 1800 , centuries centuries ago .
almost a fifth of the greenhouse gasses from livestock -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the <unk> and the <unk> and the animals are to produce the <unk> of the tools , isn &apos;t just fine .
<unk> was a <unk> .
a picture of <unk> would be better , or it &apos;s got better ?
so it wasn &apos;t very bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would mean that maybe that might not be as bad as that .
i asked a question about a year ago , &quot; why am i , although i know , i know , what i know , no ? &quot;
the weekend you have to do the choice .
you can make an image with an iphone , and even it &apos;s all names that &apos;s even even mistake .
they &apos;re not <unk> . it &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would mean , it &apos;s an interest in to find more about to find out the stakes , but it &apos;s a very depressing area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a big artwork .
human nature had to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we &apos;re a ethical level of the <unk> level of what &apos;s been there -- is that they &apos;re intrinsic valuable .
it could be more complicated , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i had a moment that i need to get some remote control .
so there &apos;s a <unk> , there &apos;s a dynamic , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that you can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and <unk> the individual slices , as the <unk> in the hallway , and <unk> us .
i was sure 20 , before i first went into an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got to choose the same criteria as you want to pick the work .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they were interested in creating a novel , alternative <unk> , and they needed cash for it , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising to make projects .
this project is called <unk> .
and so we went to the grave and made this , was very shocking -- the attention that we got .
and she describes like the <unk> -- all you say is like the <unk> of the <unk> of fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s an artist .
it &apos;s related to origami . so it &apos;s going to go .
people are applying mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles .
or you &apos;re going to move it on the top , and they &apos;re making 50 stars on a flag that &apos;s 13 .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules out of these things that you &apos;re packing in circles , and you &apos;re covered in the dotted line , the extra rules that makes the crease pattern .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to get it bigger , you could need something origami .
and this doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re in space or if you &apos;re going into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> state in washington with a lot more time for a time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about <unk> for hours .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this is going to be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> the market market market , and it goes on until the day day .
there was the instruction up .
because i &apos;m writing a book , i still am still still , and i &apos;m not going to answer this .
and that was very disheartening for you .
because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , come back to us in the form of pop culture , in this weird and some sort of <unk> way , where you can see it .
there &apos;s no man or not a woman who is in the middle and the wires .
and the personal income on a scale that is held constant to account for inflation , is more <unk> than doubled , almost <unk> .
and to listen to me and understand what i say , you know , you &apos;re going to have 60 bits of bits per second .
and just keep going to happen , so in the last book of me , i &apos;ve interviewed a bunch of ceos , &quot; i interviewed some ceo of their surroundings as successfully and at the same time with very <unk> <unk> .
control is always a safe thing , because you &apos;re probably feeling it &apos;s a very good thing , but not terribly .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own sense of what home is , they had their sense of community , and even for hostility , which was the <unk> of birth to the <unk> . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are in the future or the present , as the present , as the past .
i went down into the room where i was supposed to sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between the developed world in the developed world and two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why i &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , digital technology .
and the kids are survival is the new green .
and again , they were better than we do , &quot; you british and your mortality rate at heart disease . &quot;
but if you &apos;re low-income , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with <unk> , made them grow , and i worked with <unk> -- mice , mice , that could not produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
if you could be very good at the equator as well as well as the equator .
certainly , many advances , many <unk> lives .
this is actually actual photograph , at times , the <unk> shows that the limb is <unk> within less days .
and you see the right on the right , which is six months later , the technically <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> is made of two different types of types .
so we put it back into this oven-like device .
more complex organs , more complex organs , are the most complex solid organs that are highly <unk> , with lots of <unk> <unk> organs , liver liver , liver , liver and kidney .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not going to be <unk> and not make tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem there would have an idea .
so i &apos;m actually a little bit of panic -- unlike all of the <unk> and sugar , i had some of the <unk> , and i was really <unk> .
that doesn &apos;t mean you need to go to a <unk> .
i went to door door and sells <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .

people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we &apos;re making this stuff a bunch of different molecules , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to breathe that there &apos;s a certain reason for a certain reason and so .
and so , charles , she said , &quot; charles , i &apos;m going to give you a building , and you can &apos;t meet you there , but don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody was going to do a little bit of mind .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i still have something that is not personal .
if you want to be rich , entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs .
they &apos;re saying , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s not going to increase -- it &apos;s not going to increase it , and we &apos;re actually measuring this for 20 years from the satellite , and they &apos;re not going to increase .
biochemist kary mullis : &quot; <unk> mullis : the foundation of modern science : the experiment , and he shares stories from the 17th century and his own <unk> in the garden and <unk> the curiosity , inspiration in all of their shapes .
i wanted to represent a very simple way of a living body that <unk> these <unk> , decrepit spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a relief for new york and &quot; <unk> &quot; and <unk> &quot; the <unk> and <unk> that comes from the feeling of the <unk> in a urban environment .
i love to travel , and berlin is one of my <unk> <unk> .
and all the time i &apos;ve not seen a rat was seen in some of these places , until recently i was walking into the city of the city .
the first question is , and maybe you write them either on a paper , physically , or a virtual leaf in your head , and , for the audience home , you can see it &apos;s also what you can do .
and we stop , &quot; we &apos;re the best <unk> college in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you &apos;re going to be -- you know -- well , in your <unk> , you &apos;ve got , &quot; hmm , what &apos;s happening during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult issues is , if people have already a sense of how everything works , it &apos;s quite hard to change those that works .
and as an expert on a single time of inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues , the different from the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , he <unk> , <unk> , grows in a way .
we have an amazing life of life that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself introduced into a letter to a fellow , that life probably was going to work somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe in scotland , maybe in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what &apos;s life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can combine them and we can literally create thousands and thousands of <unk> molecules to create large amounts of <unk> molecules , in the same size of proteins and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in vision .
we want to put them in the environment , and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can manufacture inorganic biology and matter matter to matter , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , what is actually life .
but there &apos;s another second reason why i love these <unk> : each one is , every one .
and these are high women who have been sitting in an hour and sit for an hour and ask her to question .
i was sitting on friday in friday , and i was able to see how the mortality rate was going on this morning of <unk> .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more and more of them .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make any sense of a average , which is not a <unk> , and that very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
they were high , or very high , child mortality and their families were very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s the <unk> .
whatever is more value for money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he said , &quot; well , &quot; <unk> the <unk> .
all the time was a border .
and <unk> , after my opinion , is going forward , not just a difference , not just for a few , not just for a few , but everyone .
and above the knee , it &apos;s hard to be able to ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth &apos;s enough to meet everybody needs , but not everybody &apos;s going to meet .
and <unk> are dying .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific research research research -- 40 laboratories -- when two <unk> were not born with each other languages , i built teams .
they &apos;ve got it up , and now i have applications in the app app app .
it &apos;s about something old and a little old thing to lead to the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but no more <unk> .
because this reactor &apos;s not under high pressure and chemically <unk> is not so reactive , meaning the <unk> of the body , is not the way to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i &apos;ve designed here is a innovative power of being a great energy project , the great scientific projects , and i &apos;m really willing to do this .
we &apos;re moving towards a <unk> where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in the case that they run in the forest .
at the end of a long <unk> of good advice he &apos;s going to give his son <unk> , he says this : &quot; particularly , is <unk> against yourself .
usually you go much in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk much , and you can walk around in this city .
then they &apos;re <unk> , as a fake , <unk> -- by making the qualities you don &apos;t have .
when i was little , i was very introverted , and i was like to just like to myself .
and then it was just about to start to start at one point and then to build them up to the bottom .
so i built it out of concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was that the instrument .
and for me , that &apos;s the most important thing , because i &apos;ve been a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the <unk> <unk> <unk> : poor and hands develop for 36 days : the primitive inflection marks will be the <unk> <unk> of the fetus , the fetus , the fetus developed the fetus .
the complexity , in a single system , is beyond any understanding of any understanding or any of any today math .
because apparently , this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere of stars .
so what can you do with this spectra ?
recently , a colleague i sent to a colleague , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you look at this time ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- in which matter and chemical elements in the universe , and the chemical elements are made .
because can you imagine anything that is <unk> ?
now , imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and say , &quot; so , we &apos;re not going to work . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see <unk> , and oxygen , i think , we &apos;re going to have the perfect legacy .
i just like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you is universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly hooked on a <unk> , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little collapse -- -- the actual thing was like that .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what &apos;s the feeling of being vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t quite have . shut up . shut .
we pretend that what we do , not the impact of other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , you can make systematic improvements , then we think about how to be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do was , which is , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
steven is now sharing his story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this brain that also includes these <unk> , and these were the only <unk> that are available online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you don &apos;t have data , this is not going to work .
this is the curve about the <unk> .
but my brother , i didn &apos;t go to the end .
if we went from the <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;d run something like this , 300 feet wide , 70 miles wide , a total of <unk> , and the two is <unk> .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can make this better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s called the <unk> .
these are networks are very beneficial in the very complex system .
and it also has implications for systemic risk .
so we could put a <unk> <unk> .
we see the evolution of <unk> and <unk> programs that are focused on to understand our connected world from complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had a 500 of these <unk> .
without any human <unk> .
so we were up on the top of our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t mean something that &apos;s invented .
and my brain starts to think very quickly , that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> to be positive in the world .
because this question predicts that our external world can predict our <unk> , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s eye , if i can predict her entire external world .
and this is from two reasons scientific <unk> and <unk> .
we &apos;re getting people to write when they open their open , and a positive email from the <unk> or the <unk> of somebody in their social environment .
hard to say -- a <unk> -- they understand -- my father was the most <unk> man in the world .
and so i went . i went off , closed .
they said , &quot; well , make it stop .
they take a giant disk of cardboard .
he was the first digital media <unk> in tokyo .
listen ? how cows ? this is the morning 4 : 00 pm in the morning .
so there &apos;s all these things , but most of love i love to experience the world , taste .
and i was highlighting this with passion .
their culture comes in schools , and i want to see how to illustrate this problem , how to overcome this problem .
so that &apos;s why she &apos;s nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and about little moments in my life .
or mothers , who raised young young ?
we need to change attitudes to boys in the primary sciences .
and you have the idea that you think that you &apos;re thinking .
let &apos;s see where this is going to take us .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give us &quot; why &quot; <unk> evidence about the fundamental principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and give up the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was an important lesson for me to really , you know , that you can really manipulate the object .
we have created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s a radio star with my ipad , and that &apos;s a software that runs on the ipad .
so it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> . i &apos;m so <unk> them to get a <unk> , so that people will respond in the glass differently , if you go off it .
i &apos;m going to turn my <unk> in a middle-aged male , and then in an old man .
<unk> extra trial were allowed .
radio : what do you think ?
just fold the wings together , and you go on .
so i ask you another question .
and he made a <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , who had <unk> , and night , and the secret instruction , it &apos;s not particularly good to <unk> him .
because they &apos;ve found that <unk> behavior is more powerful .
but we need to create a clear <unk> model of creating this kind of value , and it &apos;s a lot of fair .
so if we all have these tools , we just need to ask the question -- and it &apos;s made and <unk> and <unk> -- how we use these smart devices .
they &apos;re going to lead the new <unk> .
they give little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt passion , soul and heart , had my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , <unk> <unk> is another replicator in this culture of culture .
you probably bought them .
imagine the world of brains and more memes than a place for you all there .
we are the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hi .
they &apos;re using us to produce the resource of the planet &apos;s resource to produce more and more and more amazing things that we hear at ted .
and will we go through this third of the brain , how we &apos;ve gone to the second and first of it ?
in conjunction with <unk> -- this is the <unk> prevalence in haiti -- with the ministry of public <unk> , with various <unk> , peru , peru , more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us if we &apos;re right . &quot;
and because i was burning at 70 percent of my body , all the time , all an hour .
and we &apos;ve also found that it would have been good , and i would have been tearing down in my way , and then i would have been <unk> .
and how bad would the punishment be , if i could get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most <unk> people -- who have more stringent <unk> -- less <unk> , and that &apos;s the less religious -- those who could not remember , <unk> , <unk> .
so if you &apos;re not at the end of a few seconds , you &apos;re not going to get your brand , you know , does it make a difference ?
it &apos;s so that .
i think all these forces have very bad implications for the market .
but you can believe . i work in the advertising commercial .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly , amazon will become the brand and it <unk> with the <unk> , defined how they want to spend their money , which is what money is , and what it is .
maybe that &apos;s a big leap ?
i don &apos;t have to explain this , i don &apos;t have to explain it , last week , i had to explain my nine-year-old -- these are the structures that beat sperm from one individual individual to another .
and i knew animals like the <unk> here , or even most of the animals , they &apos;re not stabilize their tissues by bones they &apos;re contract .
and that was that every skeleton that we found every single one that we found was the same <unk> , the same <unk> had been .
all i showed that was really surprised .
a funny song about global warming , by the jill sobule .
well , i &apos;m going to be , i &apos;m going to now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> totally out of about this , and ben became a <unk> .
so , what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave , my home , the democratic republic of the congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> has the u.s. <unk> of the united nations , the assets of the country , over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the target .
they have to be very inexpensive .
but couldn &apos;t be done for this angle of the <unk> ?
they demanded from the governments to have their own capacity , and in many cases they have them .
but let &apos;s take a time , our goal is to bring new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because they would have a whole bunch of transactions to make their revenues to make their revenues .
he liked to sit in her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since the <unk> , as sir <unk> , the british society and the british society thought that the sun seems like the sun .
so , what &apos;s wrong ? here &apos;s something <unk> .
and this energy is <unk> the fusion .
so , as high as a result of conventional <unk> .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the biggest arab country and also one of the big impact .
but they wanted to be the democracy , but they were all the countries that the population was asked to have their citizens in the last month of their opinion on a civil government -- it was only four percent .
but the expectation of the people that are really important to the future .
so the question is , &quot; what drives the male support for women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the news .
nobody can listen to them , they just send them to text .
you could see the immediate effects of the laws of the laws of the <unk> speech , or see a <unk> speech , and see what happens .
the flight of the flight was 12 seconds and went over 35 .
this is a <unk> for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
the smallest <unk> of the <unk> forces of nature .
we can afford to be able to be able to be <unk> and <unk> .
we believe somebody else , somebody <unk> , somebody <unk> , somebody with more means solving this problem .
we didn &apos;t flew it into the pacific .
it took 10 of these full prototypes until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s this incredible <unk> of this incredible <unk> , which is that it &apos;s serious serious what it means .
and let &apos;s think about our moral imagination .
and the director was quite brave and he said that he was mad and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are <unk> . these guys are <unk> &apos; <unk> . these guys are <unk> .
it needed several such events to me , until i figured out what i should do .
when i started this program four years ago , my <unk> plan was a <unk> of the <unk> .
and they look down to <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy i had 15 years ago , my courage to spend my lectures at cbgb &apos;s at cbgb &apos;s <unk> , where i could do these incredible rides with this group of <unk> children , and actually , in russia , the <unk> .
and how often would my dying die , before i could understand that it doesn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly enough , <unk> this insights doesn &apos;t feel my sense of <unk> , that sense of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t even have anything that was between .
imagine what kind of existence , if we honor the horror of the self , and the privilege of being value of life , is value of life , and what &apos;s excited about what is next .
and this is a cafe in the sea in britain .
but instead of what we &apos;re looking at is we focused on the function of how we &apos;re going on .
and we also discovered that as a <unk> structure , and we would get a <unk> way through this structure .
but we realized that seed -- this really important thing -- but that seed -- but that seed -- the <unk> -- the <unk> , the <unk> are not released .
we worked with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of seed seed seed to be a little bit of it , even if you &apos;re visually impaired and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s just just the first few of us who are perceiving , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea because the human mind is a blank slate , and all the structure of its socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a lot of a political reasons that they love to enjoy .
it &apos;s still not clear if it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s <unk> to support this , but then the <unk> of the <unk> .
another one of the <unk> and <unk> at universities who are in <unk> , in the demise of decline in decline .
well , the other hot iron iron is the <unk> .
and i think you can &apos;t tell you all better .
i also call <unk> , just as a <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but you &apos;re saying it .
there &apos;s no script there , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking about . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s weird .
so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> challenges .
right ?
it &apos;s the way -- we &apos;ve been telling the work of the war as a society , every one of us .
her iphone with no people , the same skin , the same circuits , the same keyboard , always over and over again .
and then it was always thicker and the <unk> and it &apos;s <unk> pages .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you &apos;re going in there ? &quot;
but how is you sitting in a mentally normal way ?
so , all of the things that happened to tony on tony &apos;s evidence was evidence according to his clinician , that he was crazy to this new kind of crazy kind .
he came in <unk> businesses , and <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , american cities are just transformed into <unk> .
and i added up to , &quot; i have a list of some sort of <unk> features in my pocket .
and the nerds are always the absolute aspects of the character of the interviewee .
however , it was like two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended up .
in fact , the trend is the <unk> of the world &apos;s office .
and as a consequence of that , it &apos;s very , very hard to say , very hard to say , i &apos;m <unk> the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a great war between east and west became the underlying democracy , and that the fundamental democracy against communism was needed .
and although the president of it , very , very good , has been very good at the <unk> of islam , is not the enemy of islam , there &apos;s nonetheless , is nonetheless , a natural impulse on the <unk> to call the other side .
when the treasure <unk> in 2000 , you know , you &apos;re just the peak of the best penetration that scientists have had been on , the scientists have ever been on , and at that time , the <unk> of being <unk> .
and the day after our arrival were two of us with the <unk> of the two , and the room 2 , more than 4,000 oiled penguins .
we have used this method in the treasure rescue .
and this is really important because the african penguin was stated a endangered way of explaining .
at the <unk> row in <unk> row , a <unk> , before a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police station .
people are open for the <unk> .
so we launched this campaign -- very quickly , called &quot; every egg . &quot;
this is not a <unk> of the second grade .
these are just teaching <unk> , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> you do , is not your neighbors . this is the rest of the rest of my own .
now -- this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes <unk> and puts him carefully at his father , and the two men look at each other and see each other as divine .
this is the way of the cells that are really going to really put me in biology and science , which is looking at living cells cells in the microscope .
each of the sand is a tenth of a tenth millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this picture was the beginning of the <unk> .
we all look inside the inside , believe me .
the walls are made of 700 inches thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s the one on the left is an x-ray .
it &apos;s got human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little <unk> in the corners .
i had to <unk> the car in the middle , and you didn &apos;t really have a really simple job .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys for a week , and after this week , they have used to use them as a toilet .
the science is actually saying that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i applaud a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we don &apos;t agree with us .
not professor and <unk> , just two ghosts , ready to <unk> .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacture was that there were right there between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
then would be time to process the information ?
we spent a lot of time , a $ one billion dollars in a billion of a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to see a billion <unk> <unk> <unk> that he was involved , and what we found was shocking , but more later .
there &apos;s dan etete .
we were struck by these companies that had quickly <unk> their <unk> and the most important in london <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all the old . we &apos;re going to get sick . people are leaving .
there are places you cannot go , don &apos;t think of the way you can &apos;t think of the worlds that you can &apos;t be able to inhabit .
they have a <unk> and an freedom of that i think you &apos;re the foundation of a new <unk> .
she made the decision to get no <unk> or <unk> , but their life to do that , they &apos;re not going to have a girl .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you <unk> this thing to the head , and then you get this thing .
but this isn &apos;t . &quot;
i miss michael .
and he didn &apos;t find the way he was going to <unk> him , and they said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go into the rehab , or you &apos;re going to die and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet it , the <unk> beloved beloved . let &apos;s pull out .
if it &apos;s in the box , which is the <unk> , then it &apos;s that .
the characteristics of what are the word <unk> are so often in adults that we should eradicate this age of <unk> , if it comes to criticize behavior , and <unk> behavior is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
if i <unk> the capacity to my sister , 10 percent of interest , i &apos;m going to <unk> the last <unk> of the <unk> , i will cut her ability to get more money from me to get it back .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re not living in the dark times .
and the third is all the noises that we &apos;re creating people are the <unk> .
that &apos;s after selective logging .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> of marriage , including the way animals that dance us and singing the dancing , which i &apos;d sort of <unk> for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder , how much that is , this <unk> here is 16 .
so , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very nice concert .
and these are the issues that are actually at heart .
one generation that &apos;s so much more meaning from video games , as the real world .
these are all problems outside my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games is for our civilization .
end ! finally ! that was .
it would be good good .
so , you &apos;re very quickly , you &apos;re very much , very quickly , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they look at them , and that &apos;s the pain -- i thought that at least a long time , until she explained to me , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , that &apos;s what you think about .
it &apos;s going to go into the other direction .
girl : there was a bullet and a <unk> , because it &apos;s two very different <unk> , and if you drop them at the same time , they would fall off , drop them out .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
ultimately , we &apos;re going to change ourselves as we change the world around us .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to have incredible implications .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they &apos;re going to affect us very much .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> at this point .
i &apos;m going to echo his words back right .
&quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; well , i said , &quot; strange , you know .
it &apos;s : &quot; you don &apos;t need to make it again . &quot;
we looked at that , and i was grateful because she &apos;s just said , &quot; whoa ! this is insane . &quot;
the goal of the project is quite simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in <unk> .
well the answer is a <unk> team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , which some serious serious problems at the project effect on the project , problems that shouldn &apos;t have to be .
in medicine , there &apos;s so many people who don &apos;t want to change , not quite a <unk> engineer that has already served .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and it &apos;s very fast and easy .
yes , good guys are packed me in my life because <unk> was about , from beautiful <unk> shape .
no , but it &apos;s true , the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t call them , nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth , &quot; i brought to a lot about that meeting with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they have been here , until we have been here , until we have the second microbial age .
and the impact is the distribution of this very thin <unk> on the planet , and we had a very very <unk> death of dinosaurs that death beautiful <unk> of these beautiful <unk> , <unk> here , and so much else .
it &apos;s the supreme <unk> , the t. t. of his time .
they hate animals .
this is when material comes from the deep earth and the surface , spread above the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a <unk> off of the coast , what will happen to me ?
they have an accident . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they &apos;re taking the hydrogen sulfide and , you know , 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .

he &apos;s home and drinks tea .
and you see the surface of the neocortex , you get <unk> , you &apos;re making it from a lot of little components . <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many a tree tree is ? where are you ?

we &apos;re not running as small organisms on the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we poison or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us that &apos;s been made .
now i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of digging in a moment when we have a kind of people who think you &apos;re thinking about a dog , first of all , you think , by making a dog , first of all , human rules .

but there &apos;s no evidence .
and when people started to start , objects like this , it was a clue that there was a <unk> between groups .
but who knows how to make a mouse ?
but i &apos;m also that because of the connections that people are going to be , and that &apos;s never there , and to mate with the ideas of ideas and then , i &apos;m sure that the technology will continue to continue to continue to continue to improve the more and more of the time that we continue to improve .
this is as high as a <unk> building . i &apos;m here the <unk> of the world &apos;s compared to comparison .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just way away these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , usually the rapid development problem is because how can we discover things that are constantly changing constantly ?

this expression , as a pride , was watching jessica tracy , and she showed that people , people and born to blind people to blind people , who are doing that if you win a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you can see these people , and how they &apos;re involved in particular , and you could get them to do it , and then you would get more involved ?
what happens in a <unk> , what happens if you &apos;re in the <unk> stage ? like the little little manipulation , these tiny <unk> ?

how are you with it , you personally , but also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three and a half .
this is a list of side effects : if you eat too much salt , like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you probably get to the <unk> in the intensive care .
but soon i showed the symptoms for <unk> and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably would never see my home .
i sat there and i spoke to a little bit of <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> and asked him what i needed , could be ready to prepare me .
i was on a dozen machines that thought of life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> is also in the u.s. by two percent .
and also , the same thing is interesting that the same business that &apos;s sold for us to have the 80 million pounds of atrazine , including the <unk> , the same company .
we also launched as a <unk> .
what would our kids would tell us when every day a child , i had a little <unk> , some artificial <unk> <unk> , and a little bit of a sudden a.
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , and that &apos;s not the connection .
here &apos;s a <unk> <unk> at the <unk> next to los angeles .
i offered five cents for every time .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of a elephant , and the largest part of you are hidden .
it looks like the <unk> of their <unk> and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwood trees have a tremendous surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to be something called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> is the <unk> force of the name , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , and they &apos;re helping to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see that .
but recently , all the doors of the cotton receptor is open to open up and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s first look at the <unk> <unk> .
how do these people do these infected computers ?
and you can see it &apos;s going to be able to do how we work -- like <unk> work -- and try to find a way that we meet , to deal with .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> / d b , and if you open this image image on your computer , then <unk> this program and did it go .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the gecko &apos;s the terminal <unk> is .
we need to make sure any way to make sure that everything is going to be , even when the computer is going on .
but i have nothing to do with that .
this person is around with <unk> .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does his future look like ?
these powers disappeared , nobody <unk> the 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and this kind of calculation , and it would be involved , because this would change things , but it would change things in two ways .
so that means that we can see a copy of ourselves , if you &apos;ve been using a piece of the <unk> of the pack of motion , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in motion and then a staunch <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy pair , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from her <unk> and saw her video film suddenly had spread like a <unk> .
thank you .
you will go into the distance .
that &apos;s what he taught was to do , since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful to the fact that i had a mentor like i had to join the <unk> , who taught me how to <unk> .
what &apos;s it is now driving that in life ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing , and let &apos;s make it happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . i didn &apos;t have the -- technology , you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
at this moment , it &apos;s conscious or unconsciously . right , where you &apos;re looking at something , you can <unk> yourself , you can <unk> the meaning of whatever , it &apos;s emotions .
have you ever done what was done , &quot; i was like , &quot; i was ! &quot;
so far bored , god , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true , we need it . we can do it by intimacy , through <unk> , through prayers through <unk> , through <unk> .
and there &apos;s seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through them because i &apos;m feeling . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in the <unk> area , someone in new york , who would have died if he had been the day at the day , and this man who wanted a terrorist , and it was clearly clear .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating tools , which is a great number of people who can tell their stories , people all around the world .
the color of particles is like , happy , positive feelings have colored colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was a whole day on the computer . &quot;
and if i go over here , it starts to walk the list , and there are thousands of emotions that were collected .
ten times of the time , the time capsule circle .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : &quot; submission of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this in the face of the <unk> image of betty ford , as she &apos;s the <unk> for her husband .
you can see quotes even if you like to read a quotes to read climate change .
so people are feeling clouds as a little bit of things that stands in the way .
in the life , it has tens of thousands of members of almost 100 countries around the whole world .
you just need one step out of the outside , and the way that usual is so common is so banal , that all the others are missing .
so look up , they &apos;re the short-lived beauty , and you always think the <unk> of the clouds in the clouds .
the hundred shots that have been <unk> , they would be , &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> . it was a giant machine .
this footage comes from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see how the knife is the heart to the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen that has built inside its inner , very fast <unk> .
now this is a really interesting project .
so it does .
so very talented people .
i went to kids as often as possible as possible to bring the academic stuff with the real world .
it &apos;s not all that , but it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into details why we think the universe is so , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain physics that we know .
and i always <unk> a little bit of my career in me .
in 2001 , i attended them during a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is showing that the first one in the year of the first year in 2004 .
it &apos;s a short event before the <unk> and was recently filmed with somebody who all knows .
each will have a <unk> <unk> , but in different scientific disciplines , being specialized .
i got my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he claims that &apos;s the most beautiful brain that he ever scanned .
so on the next few slides i &apos;m going to explain to you .
transistors are smaller to enable that , and that &apos;s what technology is doing better .
our <unk> is behind this lens .
i had such a feeling that we do it wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
so we can see more in our galaxy more detail than somewhere else .
and that &apos;s a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put lots of stuff there .
it pulls on a side of a much more powerful than the other and the cloud will be ripped apart .
and i hope that i have convinced you that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between stairs , cars and fire <unk> baseball .
so for example , people liked the 11th of the 11th , the way that ended up .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , about the big &quot; what &quot; what &apos;s the &quot; god , &quot; god and it was to take the <unk> and the prices .
through new and improved instruments , the age of the <unk> of the <unk> .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> : music and feelings over time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new <unk> .
and then the year 1945 , they took it to 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going to start .
wow , a volunteers , great .
but recently , my interest in this way , through a new view of view , is where there is circumstance where there is circumstance , where there &apos;s circumstance .
well , i think this is the <unk> &apos;s evolutionary development that we call &quot; crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
but the thing that &apos;s desire is really the most important thing .
we get incredible talks about you .
let me introduce you to this point of sam <unk> .
but even if you &apos;re going to <unk> the screen , you &apos;ll be more <unk> than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s going to happen right now .
how <unk> innovation nurture .
first , i have to be a service of the audience to the audience , and talk to what i &apos;m going to give him , rather than saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re fun to design their own , or <unk> .
well , you can &apos;t compare them .
they hold them alive and give them the sugars , so a kind of <unk> , which we call the superpower .
this kind of testing , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and the thought he could turn the waves . couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and in the areas of transparency , choices and <unk> and <unk> people are really empowered .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon <unk> , claims , all over the world , more photos of their head than anyone else .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers were <unk> and <unk> as helpful as helpful to helpful , because they took a certain extent to make sense of a <unk> .
so i wish everyone a nice weekend .
and to write , and writing dna , is always easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do ? &quot;
if you have a <unk> of this kind of <unk> , this is what &apos;s going to lead to a <unk> , who is allowed to perform biotechnology .
the kingdom claims , his laws allow him to be strange or <unk> or <unk> , which is an economic risk or a health care or the <unk> of the state state .
these laws are a <unk> on the face of science and based on prejudice and ignorance and a <unk> of traditions and an oven .
why are you pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 people &apos;s people &apos;s most people who inject drugs .
so the social worker , the <unk> <unk> of rotting <unk> , not even from the police , <unk> or randomly locked in <unk> or random .
here were children born , people died there .
for personal work , they &apos;re now obsolete .
they were <unk> the line , the street <unk> , the river below the street , and you come from one end to the other , without cross the <unk> to cross the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
also , fortunately , are shared jobs .
their liver does make oil .
and they killed 12,000 sharks at that time , by just a <unk> <unk> bay in <unk> bay in <unk> bay .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is that the place of a shark is coming out of the time , depending on the time and the sunset , the temperature and depth .
so let &apos;s look at the <unk> , which has been passed to the genes that are passed on to the <unk> , then we see basking sharks , compared to the first one , a factor of 10 diversity than others .
so hannah &apos;s <unk> research , and found that the size of the time is the <unk> .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build this . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists , whether it was a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the <unk> .
your body are being <unk> and are being used to use for any <unk> to make money -- people tell them a lot of these stories .
no business do not done .
my journalism may be , in other continents , or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it works , and it &apos;s going to work , and then , is about , i wonder , wonder , questions , where are the evidence ?
aa aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as a <unk> <unk> .
and had these people ever met a victim of their <unk> ?
nowadays , you can now see in 29 states , more than half of the country , because of the sexuality of the great <unk> .
i &apos;m going to realize that my mission was to photograph my mission , because there was a million different <unk> of <unk> .
at least i hope it will be harder to get their human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always getting good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and thirdly , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that had the soldiers had done .
so in three ways , the prevailing kind of meaning is authority .
this is stanley <unk> , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust happen , right ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when he &apos;s going to do something ? &quot;
stanley <unk> and i closed the way back to the high school , at the james <unk> <unk> in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the other . <unk> of self .
alexander <unk> says the border between good and evil through the heart of one human person .
and i put this experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anybody could do , &quot; no big thing , to jump up .
it &apos;s a mystery that &apos;s really hard to be .
we have a self .
but on my left , the <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s labeled through the red arrow .
there &apos;s just a <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not saying anything , except that it &apos;s supposed to be scary .
and the autobiographical itself has expanded by memory , thinking , imagination is <unk> creativity and language .
thank you . thank you . thank you for the <unk> -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m just to make it ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly the job , to admit , the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
now you have to see , i didn &apos;t give up .
she talked about <unk> , she founded <unk> , she organized <unk> , they <unk> friends -- all of those everyday acts of the world and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this <unk> , which is a homo sapiens of the former <unk> .
in fact , this is a sensor that reads the electrical activity in my brain , while i read this talk , while i think i &apos;m holding this talk .
we <unk> numerous prototypes and products to live with thoughts , like <unk> appliances , like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
the headset is wirelessly connected to an ipad or a smart .
how these kids are able to use their new consciousness to the use of their recovery , <unk> social <unk> , which people are being detected as a different disability , to see them .
it was understood the power of human narrative and that &apos;s value that we &apos;re changing in humans , changing , <unk> and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my capabilities and my possibilities .
<unk> , and very unexpected , they gave up .
this was not a <unk> that was not <unk> .
i was going to know a good thing .
and all that , quite slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in me , not all of me , not all of me , all of the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . i am my whole .
what we have is the same thing that &apos;s the same thing , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with just a little change in the posture , they feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that has to take place that is going to be about the measure of control , which we have about our tax .
for <unk> percent of that money could have invested in the stroke , which doesn &apos;t have the duration of the journey , but what the enjoyment and the usefulness of improved improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the entire one of the entire activities .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is that the field of economics is understood as a <unk> discipline of human psychology .
if you had a average response to 60 percent of it .
it will <unk> them that they &apos;re not <unk> , nor other other .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that wouldn &apos;t mean i had a coin with both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore we had sufficient effects , actually very strong effects on children around the world , and now people every age of every ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , that always wants to live forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and i &apos;ve got <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> play that he has completely composed in the way that he &apos;s fully in the world .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a <unk> .
there &apos;s the present self once , the present self .
i have to write five pages on a day for paper , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last <unk> machine , is something i created with my co-author , which is that i was introduced to my co-author , which was presented with my co-author in a previous project .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people &apos;s people , because when one of the faces smiles , the other face is <unk> <unk> .
this is one of the reasons that we think of the western science , mathematics and <unk> , actually in the first few centuries of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> developed .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not &quot; sh &quot; .
so it doesn &apos;t seem surprising to talk to people from mental illness , you probably suffer stories from <unk> , shame and discrimination in almost all walks of life .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations gathered around the world in <unk> and gave this legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about fish .
now , looking at the gains , you see , you see , almost 8,000 of these dollars are in fact .
and that was in the early stages of <unk> when india was driving <unk> -- as a means for the recovery -- after china -- after china -- after china -- at eight , 10 percent looked at eight , nine , 10 percent and wondering : why can &apos;t we do it ?
they &apos;re not <unk> , but they have trust and the courage , and they say , &quot; and that &apos;s what we do .
green carbon , so emissions is by deforestation , and agriculture , and blue carbon form together 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what things like , dick , didn &apos;t -- the sydney , by the way , not .
i also like these intellectual <unk> .
and he said , he would have had the same relationship with his father &apos;s father .
there was a theory .
it was in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed all the <unk> , and the color color , which just this fantastic <unk> hidden covers .
many of these ideas are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
if you think about it , your children &apos;s kids to send out the tinkering school , and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> .
but let &apos;s play it under their own conditions , and trust me , you &apos;re going to learn things that you can &apos;t learn from <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you want to throw away a device , don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all this . this is the number <unk> . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife , four months after the aspen , in aspen , and in a good way .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not just sharing the parts ?
this is one of the seven things that are seven to the ones that were not fired at all .
and so it came out of the years of <unk> europe , and began to buy a <unk> , then thousands of them , then hundreds of thousands of individual , and then at least , of course , millions of individual , a little piece of the hell of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we &apos;re never thinking about the hidden connections .
and the edison bulb invented , it looked like this .
you must be quite smart , and although i haven &apos;t have a <unk> , it doesn &apos;t mean me stupid , because you can &apos;t be dumb , and it &apos;s going to bring it to the world .
they literally <unk> the door .
if you listen to the <unk> of your listening , both ears are both <unk> .
we have the problem that the antenna antenna .
again , thank you again .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently , i created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> made of <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her to her particular map , and she wrote her name on her name , she sent her name and sent her out .
i &apos;m sure i can see , i can see how you &apos;re <unk> .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and limited life on earth is precisely <unk> .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m telling a little bit of how nature creates materials .
so we think about future technologies , we start to start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids , where they have different charge of charges .
and through a sequence of <unk> , you can draw one out of a billion fish , which is what you want , like a battery or a solar cell , or grow solar cell .
in this case , you see <unk> coming out .
if you ask people question , where do you go to do something important ?
i sat on my desk , using my expensive computer .
and then , sometimes you &apos;ve got a few days that you wakes up at eight a.m. , or at seven a.m. , or at seven , and you say , oh , i didn &apos;t get good at night .
in the office , most of the <unk> and distractions that people actually stop from work , <unk> .
we all know that &apos;s true . you never have a <unk> meeting that by employee by employees will be <unk> .
meetings and managers are now the two main main main main main main main main ones .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , the week , the week , i &apos;m sorry to talk to anyone .
you know , i &apos;m going to be honest , i &apos;m making this seven years now , and i have no idea how the future will look like .
but if you ask people to ask the three of the things that they carry on , they don &apos;t matter , what the culture and what the people -- tell most people , the <unk> , and if you have one , the mobile phone , and if you have one , the mobile phone .
but this is a very big , but we &apos;ve got the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
you can take 10 or 20 percent of <unk> and then -- the owner of the player &apos;s 10 or 20 percent <unk> , and there &apos;s the rest of the <unk> bar on my family .
it &apos;s the norm .
and he &apos;s kind of an appreciation for the value of <unk> .
at the same time with the spread of these mobile devices , we &apos;re going to see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story that we &apos;ll tell about .
what &apos;s the languages we &apos;re talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research findings that show how the <unk> of healthy life can impact a human level to the genetic level , and saying that if we live healthier , better food , exercise and more love to breed .
until i tell you who said it .
within that framework , we &apos;re able to feel regret over many different things .
when i went home , i went home , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost almost the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s a fifth .
i mean , even the dumb &quot; answer is , &quot; the <unk> can let us go back in <unk> .
and as i used to say , i am a <unk> .
i thought i &apos;d try to prepare my ted wish to try and do what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to fit this , what &apos;s going to do .
no one in india . now , at least one half a million active active .
and i thought the thought that anyone in this world must think about the organization of the organization of the <unk> .
and so we did that .
listen to this : less than four 10th of one percent of those who were treated , they were used to use their medicine or <unk> in <unk> ways .
it &apos;s worth an opportunity and i think it would be successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
if the <unk> is used , you will create 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
so , the average women in cooking cooking food ate the food in <unk> and they use secrets that are just their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and studied it .
green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords were still healthy and not <unk> . &quot;
then apple alex out , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was one reason that i was .
the <unk> isn &apos;t naturally .
but it &apos;s not about that .
initially , the internet was a <unk> tool , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave my real , everyday life leave .
&quot; it &apos;s human disease . &quot;
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing test .
before i was an architect , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you going ? &quot;
we used two <unk> pages as a single side , because it &apos;s the readers that will be true .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind it ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not running for it .
it &apos;s <unk> and terrible things happen to me .
all lost the hope in my cure .
so they went to their <unk> and all the <unk> furniture -- they gave me the <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away this road is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight car , and you had a horrible accident , and they had a horrible accident that she was carrying .
i thought that there was some reason for some reason , and just for family and friends .
for example , the way that we make a molecular structure .
he took me with the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we &apos;ve got all symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it because i have a little bar installed , right ?
if i move a magic train , and then one thing that makes a third of a third , it makes a third .
galois has made a set of rules of what these charts , these symmetries , interact with these symmetries .
so , one of the symmetry we call <unk> .
instead of all the clutter , i want to know , how many digits you have , ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects , basically , i &apos;m sorry , please , i &apos;m going to spell it for me .
first : richer diet , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison had a very <unk> company in a company .
penicillin was discovered in penicillin , but even 1940 , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of them .
it was the origin of the <unk> , which was last year last year .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos once happens . let &apos;s do the best one .
it works in every computer and the browser . minus negative , minus , minus and text is smaller .
they don &apos;t need to break it down .
and therefore , a kind of information source i make me inspire , my real desk .
a means about it would be something like a <unk> , so you get to get the more traditional desktop , and the things are <unk> on the grid .
now i get to get the heart of the music and there &apos;s no boundaries of the people .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphors with bite , and with such a sign , i want to suggest that we &apos;re a bit <unk> of contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just <unk> , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists to wall street , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them , this is a book on flies , which you might have on amazon <unk> .
these are not <unk> ; it &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually interesting .
go . shake . it &apos;s all .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> traffic lights , so with <unk> , save a lot of life , but there &apos;s an excessive cure of them .

and i know many of you have , last time , that these are really cool things are really cool .
there were two <unk> that were particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s like the <unk> cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it &apos;s not water , because water is frozen .
today i want to talk about how these exponential technologies are .
so , we look at how exponential technology affects health .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there &apos;s wireless <unk> .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us to be more better with our patients and more time to focus on the key , human elements of medicine , through this kind of technology , <unk> of technology .

and they went to the shore , and they wanted to return to shore , and they were all five died on the <unk> .
and that was a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but a few days later , we thought we &apos;d like to start with our students and we said , &quot; what would happen if this isn &apos;t , if this isn &apos;t , &quot; what would have been this condition ?
one day in <unk> <unk> miles off the coast of <unk> in one of the most remote parts of the pacific , we saw 20 american <unk> of the pacific , and the <unk> of the pacific .
but a certain point , though , is to learn most of these visions , and become adults .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to be more likely to read them more than others .
right . i &apos;ve been reading a remarkable gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> in the world , an opportunity to glimpse into the future , if you &apos;re still in time , you look to your appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them in every living room of the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated by their people , by the masses , and now we &apos;re going to collapse them to another .

so this is a <unk> overview of all the high animals of the <unk> in the united states , and these are the studies that show that <unk> are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these terrible pictures from africa .
now , i say , well , great <unk> .
ines a <unk> on the streets of <unk> . she &apos;s a girl .

originally from the <unk> <unk> , which later the <unk> was , an instrument with <unk> bodies and <unk> where the sound is going to come .
well , that &apos;s more simple than done .
we were not stupid : we were in about five feet a piece of plywood .
when <unk> were new , i thought , why can &apos;t you take the oldest <unk> rhythms , the <unk> rhythms , and they &apos;re using the latest technique ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a ethics .
it &apos;s important to show the place in the room , because it &apos;s imperative , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of the absolute notion of the room that &apos;s been the <unk> of the space that &apos;s been god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation of it was creating it somehow .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a <unk> and giving it , and you &apos;re taking it , the politics is .
there &apos;s another one to be here in two years ago , jonathan haidt , jonathan haidt , who &apos;s the work in three different layers .
and just let everything happen .
so while five months he <unk> , he was to experiment with a complete <unk> .
that wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or <unk> reed or the chemical brothers who have all played there , they all had their own casa coup .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of <unk> .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s a lot of the way to do with the identity of the living with the <unk> of the dead .
but the <unk> and the <unk> of wealth shows the status of wealth , and so the family of the deceased , and the family of the deceased .

eight years of history , eight minutes of history , is just going to end up .
and jack nicholson says , &quot; because because of because i want to be a better person . &quot;

so i &apos;m going to give you the message in advance : try to <unk> .
where are the little ? &quot;
here &apos;s people again .
as you can imagine , it &apos;s a thing , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but if you go into a museum and says , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m your <unk> <unk> , right ? &quot;
and you could mean , that &apos;s one of a clue .
so we &apos;re <unk> and we collected a lot and we found a lot of animals .
so we know that a <unk> is a <unk> triceratops .
look at it as if it &apos;s even bigger .
we wanted to make a big shift .
so all the water in the world are here , so we thought that after you &apos;re the water , you know , you can breathe through the water and breathe water , you could drink the building .
the drill was a <unk> .
you get up to this glass elevator , the <unk> elevator .
before , after that .
this is a guy from salt lake lake , and so that &apos;s where it looks out there .
&quot; dig &quot; -- as if they were seduced , they were <unk> .
it &apos;s not sure that this would be so <unk> if the <unk> would have no woman .
by the way , wired &quot; wired to heart .
analyzing the news , they &apos;re talking about something like that , like the people that were doing in the new york times .
this particular plant filters out of <unk> and other <unk> chemicals out of the air .
m most of the time i &apos;m going to need the morning , when i get <unk> , what &apos;s going to happen to see what &apos;s going to happen .

malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that could reduce their <unk> percent by 75 percent .
for <unk> , the <unk> &apos;s zone is a <unk> zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i was being sexually aroused by this <unk> .
so to be true , today , in their capital , some , in those big times , the treasury are tracked and <unk> at the <unk> programs of the global fund .
contrary to the contrary , it could save a lot of lives .
if we take this metaphor a genome as well as a program , you think , chris anderson , you must think that chris anderson , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in very abstract language , you &apos;re using this cell phone .
this is normal dna you can hold for normal dna .
we heat them down , throw some salt , heat , heat them down to the <unk> and cooling them , and while the <unk> <unk> the short strands of the long strand and it creates a structure .
so this works really well , and you can build patterns and build patterns , right ?
you &apos;ll just get in , you know , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you &apos;re just sitting there to other tiles that are able to match themselves .
we have a very <unk> computer where little changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and it &apos;s a much larger thing to do .
and they used to compute the computations , and to understand that , to understand and better to handle , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it , we had three <unk> <unk> : a world-class <unk> <unk> , which is fully <unk> <unk> and universal accessible to anyone with an <unk> , independent , independent , from its financial means .
in the modern time , where time is one very important , and the fight is hard , the ordinary <unk> person is , and pay the bribe to come up with the bribe .
in my last 18 months , as a lawyer , against the fight against small and large , big <unk> <unk> , the case of india is <unk> <unk> .
sm : well , the <unk> cost was less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all the last four years , which is the last four years , which come from new york to the small new zealand in the corner .
in a lot of content , we &apos;re doing a lot of things usually to design it easier to design .
so we &apos;re using these <unk> , to find unique talks , like many different fields , and these are the essential for the most creative fields , and those who are really creative between <unk> <unk> bridges .

it threatens to be <unk> by millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that the people in this region are so poor that they &apos;re more logging and to use them as a loan .

and what you find is that if you do something funny , you &apos;re going to be a little fun .

this was the essay i wrote about 11 years and i got an 2 + i got an 2 +
i have some , that would keep the long time : between five and 15 , this led to a sense of failure .
so when i look at creativity , i think , is because of this sense , i think , is this sense of the kind of <unk> that i see in the life between practically everything .
that &apos;s what &apos;s a <unk> fisher , because they &apos;re not allowed to kill living beings .

now there &apos;s been magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both of them , and the only thing they have in common is they have nothing in common .
the corners of the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s the big market .
these guys are making the <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be <unk> .

people always say consciousness is hard to define consciousness .
you can &apos;t have the idea of your own consciousness .

and peace directly <unk> you the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; the dictatorship to democracy , &quot; with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s not a <unk> thing .
and in fact , chris took me to worry about this photo , and they &apos;re not going to think you &apos;re one photo of these crazy modern artists that are not going to make you much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution that i &apos;m <unk> , right now , the largest culprits in this massive <unk> of the earth &apos;s human history , and the <unk> destruction of the biosphere .
so i asked , &quot; what would t -- we call it <unk> , where it absorbs the impact , in the denominator -- let &apos;s call him <unk> , how to <unk> the impact ? &quot;

the arts , whatever they do , every time they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re going to look at our face , to look our opponents .
the three sisters of <unk> <unk> with her passionate music music , at tedwomen , they start with the <unk> new life , and <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to play a <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to play a <unk> version of <unk> <unk> .
the manchester <unk> is named after my own quarter .

we have noticed that you have to give them flowers and the sunlight and the food and the <unk> and herbie &apos;s music and so you can always cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids , who were given up all the world that are abandoned in public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and the <unk> and good music and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s got very good to work today .
and i &apos;m going to give you the concert to record the concert , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and you should have to choose to sell them to you , you &apos;d sign them to the same time that the money is being used to help . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson &apos;s been built in our school last to last christmas year last christmas christmas .
the brown building , is that you looked at me , and i tell you where i made my biggest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s got a group of people <unk> .
bill <unk> shares a calm and powerful history of salvation through art , music and unusual alliance .
and the guy is then making the <unk> of the brain , and the code of the brain , and the result is a <unk> , which produces a normal <unk> .
but there was the <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better to make normal reactions , and that was our contribution .
it &apos;s just a invisible <unk> , the attacks of the environment , so that we &apos;re going to stay healthy .
but if the bacteria grow and double and double all of those molecules to make these molecules , then the number of molecules will be the <unk> of the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a <unk> of her skin .
bacteria &apos;s incredibly <unk> , which is back to the back of antibiotics that &apos;s killing antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior , and they &apos;re going to fulfill tasks that could never be able to do if they were just going to be a individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to get to this conference .
or the first one that comes into the hall .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says that we need to think about , is the actual nature of the most potent activity of the qualities and qualities that are worth them , and they &apos;re <unk> .
what would you have ?
charlie , what do she say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he <unk> it .
so aristotle had to be <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> <unk> question of marriage &apos;s marriage &apos;s <unk> .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic
many people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> have to say , the rural guys don &apos;t say what we &apos;re supposed to do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future of mankind can make a decision .
if that is , what does that mean for us ?
i mean , i claim that the speed of the <unk> is going to be .
i &apos;m saying that this is nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold , because we don &apos;t get any <unk> at the time we get a <unk> age , and that even the <unk> <unk> had been <unk> before our birth of birth .
that means you have to do your homework to understand if that is true .
audience : hi . hi somewhere in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of virtually a living lifespan of virtually every one of 10 years is now .
not one of their media has done it .
we don &apos;t care about it , how we make our profit .
they went into the center of <unk> and put it in the heart of the agenda .
i can &apos;t present a <unk> , the <unk> are the ones i think of economists , epidemiologists and <unk> experience .
the <unk> is something that &apos;s a little scary , and probably you know part of the <unk> .
fourteen americans dying every day of asthma , the three times a day of asthma , and almost everything from the &apos; 90s , almost everything comes from .
he was obviously making sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> are scared to market <unk> as &quot; <unk> &quot; to <unk> .
secondly , because we &apos;ve got extinct .
so we thought , &quot; try . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go , and we pay people , and pay people to see every <unk> that they saw .
he may think he would have the <unk> baby ever , so he would have a little bit of the time , so he needs a little bit of help from outside .
i asked peter , if you had something changed . and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
now , we want to talk to &quot; africa : &quot; the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful africans .
but all of all , they need to live in their lives , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that can be done .
we can combine it all together ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl between the legs of these people , and my sister at my sister to find a window .

and often i don &apos;t see african staff among them .
the question is now , how we can use to use all of this good will be coming to us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is a <unk> product , i took this case to be the case that we can study them , exactly how we can study any other complex neurological process .

and then i &apos;m in the room room , here , games in the shift .
now , how do you study rap ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity in <unk> that &apos;s involved in <unk> .
i want to say that we have the probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and <unk> .
that &apos;s very time-consuming , and isn &apos;t quite pleasant .
but keep the thought of the time that the time is eight seconds .
in games , virtual worlds , for example , can be used to control their facial expressions , and intuitively become very intuitive to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they &apos;re very quickly , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children are dying .
another statement of esther was that we respond to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s made from the <unk> and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in their <unk> , a very cheap laser is a very cheap laser .
audience : aye .
so what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve got all the time , we &apos;ve never done it , and we never managed to <unk> the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant house house .
and this is the <unk> that you see here , actually , actually , actually , actually , in a <unk> <unk> , which is being turned on and <unk> .
so water is an important aspect .
&quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; the earth &quot; still .
the idea is not yet .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
as soon as it touches water , you should hear the air out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the minimal genome of a self-replicating species , it could be , because even a smaller genome could give it ?
we realized we , once we , once that worked , a real chance of going on , if we could get the synthetic chromosome to bring it to the bacteria , it would be the bacteria .
so , care is <unk> .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand that . &quot;
but in fact , we live in the northwest , very close to the actual picture of the koran &apos;s the paradise of paradise , which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> by <unk> .
but more you add more , more than you &apos;re lost more .
and this number of 72 never never come .
this is a nest that colony is colony &apos;s nest , and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony that &apos;s been initiated by a queen in the previous summer .
the <unk> -- this is supposed to represent a leaf -- is an interesting group . they &apos;re going to fall in the morning , before the first group of foraging <unk> .
oddly enough , and interestingly , it looks like about half the ant &apos;s ant just doing nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the <unk> and put them to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and put it there .
the <unk> , but somehow , not get to get .
and we did experiments that the longer we show , the longer one ant has more and the more <unk> the simple <unk> on their surface , and so they smell the ants make different work they work differently .
they &apos;re all the earth , except the antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this is 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of oil is three trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s what we do for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it &apos;s not having nothing to do .
i think about how we can use the natural gas .
and when i got to get out of the <unk> , natural gas , nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry ?
so just 500 million <unk> .
it &apos;s never been the water <unk> or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . i &apos;m so <unk> it &apos;s the world .
these are work in <unk> manhattan , where you built the first <unk> .
these were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to <unk> this light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : that didn &apos;t just wait and wait , but then the <unk> had to be , when they finally had to , for the third time , they had to call somebody calls .
so i &apos;m going to use sometimes a clinical language , and you might not get as warm as a heart to talk about compassion like other talks about compassion .
and here is the basic idea that <unk> <unk> is good for people who are going to be <unk> .
so basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my favorite , if you &apos;re not my friend or to my family , i belong to my family , i &apos;m much less to use the golden rule on them . okay .
so , the way that the results are just going to raise . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of interdependence , <unk> , force one , the humanity of the other acknowledge is .
and they &apos;ll explain and then you think the other people think they &apos;re not respected and they &apos;re going to dominate america .
most of the diseases involve poverty , but in the case of cancer , the kids seemed to have the children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families to come from their own families .
a week , a child died , but nothing changed .
because you simply don &apos;t have this kind of energy and time it doesn &apos;t really care about it .
so he didn &apos;t really want something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant <unk> would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cancer , and that &apos;s a <unk> of you .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that was actually the right extracellular matrix , and we put the cells in there and lo and look at the time , and you see what we &apos;ve created in a culture .
and of course , we &apos;re going to ask where we now go ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
we have a <unk> journalist who was caught in the <unk> ; a young <unk> of the book that was so many <unk> quotes , that you &apos;ve taken it from the shelves ; a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a little like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you &apos;d have four good friends of one person whose person is their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can see lying ; they were talking to me , and they were on .
they were told , how big the bath was , or said , the <unk> are so far away from the hotel .
woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
and also , you want to <unk> your eyes .
but it &apos;s really opened my eyes , how often i &apos;ve gotten from life , and social networks and so on , even though , even though it was nothing very important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful tape of <unk> .
and every one that <unk> then , i ran behind .
at least for me , because if i &apos;m just doing the same thing , i &apos;ll be very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see .
are nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you care about you ? you look so cute .
so , as i &apos;m not saying , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s just not <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> for too long <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- where people are different from different races or <unk> , but but as citizens can be equal to the same as citizens .
of course , i was discovered in egypt , of course .
this had been trained in london , in yemen , in the yemen , in amsterdam , in amsterdam , to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and symbols and symbols that are using the democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , is a <unk> family of <unk> <unk> , is one of the richest families of a <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition that was <unk> for a political goal , and that was to remove the leaders .
these are tools are going to be more interesting when they &apos;re getting very bored .
it &apos;s the boundaries of the individual networks and then <unk> them .
and because of the social networking , chinese students who studied the world in the world , or companies from the rest of the world in china , people were given to the world that were heard of the world .
and finally , the chinese introduced to the chinese .
we &apos;re more in a media environment in the media globally , socially , <unk> , <unk> and cheaply .
but everything in particular , i &apos;m going to be , i &apos;m going to have a lot of how i was supposed to do it .
and at my fourth <unk> , everest , a comet , <unk> .
this is the <unk> up up to the <unk> , the first 600 feet of the climb of base base .
and this is in camp .
and there were climbers on this ridge ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck would be , another climbers , in that storm collapsed in that storm , and died in that storm .
it &apos;s so tricky because i &apos;m working on the top , sometimes , just the clothes , just by clothes .
these were <unk> .
and i can only <unk> how he did this .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back into a lot of things .
these are sherpas who light <unk> .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s really meaningful is to me , &quot; ideas that we need to share . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneurs are also becoming an urban entrepreneur , and they &apos;re wearing a lot of a lot of them to society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy to introduce democracy to the general <unk> of the universal <unk> , parliament and the <unk> and so on .
third thing are again the cities .
the second is the <unk> that we have , the entrepreneurs that are so hard to make standardized work , to create standardized jobs in companies that are 93 percent of the indian jobs in the world .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the opportunity to import a modern <unk> <unk> , so you don &apos;t have the <unk> , if you &apos;re older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important to india and importance for the world .
so the government decides to vote even once .
although some people on the left it didn &apos;t like to hear it was the revolution of the markets that the <unk> <unk> of the time , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they &apos;re terrified of mass .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the <unk> and those who represent them .
<unk> .
each of these <unk> would be statistically <unk> , two years after the <unk> .
david cameron spent 20 million pounds in a &quot; social <unk> fund , &quot; to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investment in social change
i work . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even when i was my friend named jack there , i say , &quot; oh , &quot; i &apos;m like , jack , jack , jack , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t figured out , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means i &apos;ve done everything you just heard and just done with my voice , just with my voice .
and lastly , with this one here , i can <unk> my sound , i can make my sound , <unk> , let &apos;s repeat .
so our people had to try about 5,000 different pieces of <unk> to find the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to the ones that you can do , you can &apos;t create this . anybody can do that .
on the right side , you see a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> of the blue <unk> .
his wife said , &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
so many of these patients are pulling the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgery .
he can stop the operation at any time and stop .
<unk> street , i know .
and that is where you really get much of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that runs in both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and you want it as fast as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , really , really , within these aesthetics .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time before the courts have , and the <unk> decided that it would be much too expensive .
these are the two <unk> in the logic of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i want to thank you in this place <unk> <unk> &apos;s really for her very <unk> presentation .
once i took a boat to a <unk> <unk> , and i realized that the <unk> will be , not <unk> .
i think this is one of the most poetic and <unk> things on the planet .
there &apos;s been numerous ancient <unk> in <unk> all over the u.k. , if you take a <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> were the <unk> of the churches .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope i think i can help these organisms to pay attention to their remarkable <unk> and to make my part of the <unk> longevity in the near future .
so , let &apos;s put it into something else .
20 years later , <unk> <unk> still use mobile phones , but they also also design their own <unk> , like this , which is used to <unk> in all 31 states .
what do you do with it ?
what could terrorists do now do this with us now using technology now ?
recently , the fbi has been arrested in the u.s. , that these <unk> <unk> drones to use these <unk> drones to transport in the u.s.
as we see here , we turn ourselves into the cyborgs .
now , the rate is 70 percent of the mortality , but it &apos;s hard to do it .
it will be so many people that have been <unk> the only <unk> funeral <unk> in <unk> &apos;s <unk> , like this <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
but on the other hand , i hear people talking about fear , a certain of <unk> .
and tragically , they were in 1999 , when they worked in colombia with the <unk> &apos; goal with the goal , and keep the objective of the world and the language , with two more colleagues of the farc &apos; court and <unk> and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of reasoning than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for the people who are looking for simple solutions , mild categories , because we don &apos;t think of value as it is as an pure instrument .
but the whole community , all of different <unk> , even the <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because the <unk> of the <unk> , if you &apos;re full of the juice , she &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s feeding the world , she &apos;s up to the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s take these three portraits .
i &apos;ve tried to make my wife a little joy .
why do i not make my wife , making a <unk> ?
but here is the problem . because a company is making <unk> of cotton and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my hands of my wife , &quot; why do you make a <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
now , 110 countries are access to it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i &apos;ve been there in the last seven years .
then i went to a huge amount of training . i swam in <unk> and forth .
it was actually happening that the cells in my fingers <unk> and <unk> them .
and my good friend , david saw me , and he came up to me , and he came up to me and said , lewis , i know you &apos;ve got 18 years old .

england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about <unk> of oil &apos;s oil on earth today , which is still <unk> and nurtured .
now , the end of the story -- okay , we just replacing that all of the conventional , renewable raw raw raw raw raw raw raw raw materials -- but i think that &apos;s a story more on the story .
so , very special material that the abalone can make it , millions of abalone <unk> , all day , every day .
and the idea was basically that i was the brush in the hand of the great characters that come and i would interview i would .
but i wanted interviews that are different .
in fact , my first <unk> was george abbott , who was the <unk> of the age , and the <unk> was full of life -- i think you can define it .

so on the way i had to shut down a few bridges behind me .
and all the time , the <unk> and students who were telling you , they &apos;re going to be denied a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and <unk> things that i &apos;m actually drawing .

and he has the problem of the health effects of <unk> wood and coal .
it &apos;s a place where , for instance , if this was india , in this room , only three of us would have a car .

there &apos;s a big difference .
after an operation , everything is <unk> .
well , this is not surprising . but we asked them to grade their piece and intelligence , kindness and <unk> .
he married . he had a son called <unk> .

so i want to tell a little bit of the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are , we &apos;re going to be .
we can replace the bone of bone bone marrow , but we &apos;re not very much yet with replacing the <unk> of <unk> .
my theme is the food in schools , because here is social justice .
and the next are <unk> .
people are talking about sustainability all the time , but we should figure out what &apos;s at all .
you know , everybody think you &apos;d need to eat more and more food ?
and they <unk> , hey , we can sell this stuff to children .

the things that we might do is to do that , and so important , we &apos;ve got to teach kids to teach kids in schools .

europe had to be <unk> into the economic development .
the booms of the natural resources are not all the way , but but yet , but many countries the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong ? why is it called &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
and so the countries need a very <unk> politics .
a few economists were just in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to see this ? &quot; you &apos;re not going to unveil the score . &quot;
in that moment , a billion people are stuck in the world , and how can we help them , and how can we help them ? the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> plan to connect the gap between arm and rich .
we don &apos;t have a container where they &apos;re made .
here &apos;s a english surgeon in africa that &apos;s required to actually <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
so we &apos;re going to imagine this : imagine , you know , you could talk a lecture and could talk to people in their mother .
&quot; <unk> of the surgery surgery .
i was actually swimming in this common material , <unk> that used for centuries , that &apos;s been used for centuries .
he asks me if i could build this as a <unk> piece for the city .
so , we were experimenting with little <unk> <unk> to create a dry fog that &apos;s grown by wind , and what it was , and the test turned out to be shaped by people who could interact with it , and can move to move without <unk> .
they were in their <unk> in the grass , and they monitored <unk> patterns of the <unk> next to people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the wonders .
and i was also paying attention to that , that this is a tremendous risk for our society .
when peter <unk> is moving , this yellow spot is the <unk> area that &apos;s the appropriate place to the activity that <unk> in <unk> .
if you do this , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these changes are also going to be able to pass over the death of death itself , even a claim that can be true or be wrong .
now let me make you clear , what i &apos;m saying , i don &apos;t say science is going to be able to find this space , or that we will be scientific responses to each other &apos;s moral question .
now , why would this be objective of objective to not <unk> ?
so , what &apos;s the probability that &apos;s likely to be a <unk> is the <unk> of human development ?
on the left-hand side , you see edward <unk> .
we live in a world with <unk> technologies and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easier to break things up than they &apos;re together together .
but then we have to talk again about well-being in a wider context .
and what &apos;s his natural enemy , what the means of the <unk> beetle &apos;s the good beetle , that we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , no <unk> of insect insect could be able to <unk> it , <unk> , <unk> , a fast and <unk> <unk> .
and if we put these good <unk> , for example , in a <unk> , go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on over 1,000 square , 10,000 <unk> -- that &apos;s the equivalent 10,000 <unk> -- biological <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides are saving .
thirdly , to increase consciousness of farmers for the potential of this planet .
<unk> is one of my favorite <unk> .
it &apos;s a fun thing to do about the <unk> rich funny fun , than <unk> others . i often do that .
urban <unk> , &quot; the city &apos;s &quot; to take the new yorker .
her name was <unk> <unk> , and so that -- i wasn &apos;t <unk> enough to say &quot; take a drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union , just a few decades , maybe within a decade , after the time , instead of the time , the soviet union was most powerful .
because there are 80 percent out there that are really eating insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do all these balls in soup , but it &apos;s just in meat ?
it &apos;s 25 of an <unk> person per year .
so far , we decide to take one , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase it a little bit of the time of the ground , but it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not available .
now , my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; ah , we have to put it on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even when canadians do the system , they do it , do it a way that &apos;s going to benefit society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back , some other other gadgets , <unk> , and scales to make some computations can make some computations . okay ?
right . so , the device is used to use .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that &apos;s just quite amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i &apos;m talking about is strider .
it &apos;s just going to use to show that if you have cameras or other sensors , because it &apos;s a foot , it &apos;s a foot 80 to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
for instance , in this case , although the left and the right wheel and the right wheel with one of the single axis is , and so fast fast .
welcome to <unk> , the robot interactive laboratory of <unk> tech tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the <unk> .
and again , how he &apos;s doing it . this was our first first trial , and ...
but what &apos;s the secret of our success ?
but just from a spark of imagination , isn &apos;t enough .
so this is a very important education .
<unk> , who are going to be <unk> .
there is basically no ponds of good teachers teachers . and only eight percent of the people of the county have a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a whole empty empty in the creative economy .
the goal of the game is to have all the staff on the wheels , then the team won &apos;t be the team .
but in the last few decades , but a lot of money was determined for a city , it was completely gone .
and then , the neighbors and the neighbors interview you interview , what &apos;s going to eat and why , is a homework assignment .
in this , it &apos;s literally impossible to create large <unk> spaces .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of <unk> and explore .
after four months , they <unk> , and now he &apos;s got eight months after it .
here &apos;s a few results .
this global act of action is going to change climate change , and maybe more than that fossil fuels , maybe more than those .
when i learned from these two things , i was very , both of personal reasons as well as scientific reasons .
it has a very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> foundation of the <unk> foundation .
after treatment , we let the child a kid &apos;s a series of simple <unk> , to see how to adapt vision .
the answer is , in motion , i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these <unk> and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results .
and then i have these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i judgment on it , i &apos;m looking at how that &apos;s one .
but that was the fall in the fall of the winter , and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , you know aimee &apos;s aimee &apos;s <unk> , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i was trying to see anyone i could , <unk> , against whom , against whom am i performing here ?

you can be <unk> . take it off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and designers are going to be two , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
she got somebody who came over and <unk> the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to detect the actual losses of the economy , unless we use math math .
or to the more mature jobs .
and yet , something about mathematics : mathematics looks like math -- like this -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in education education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three by hand .
when people ask me , is that true ?
but the automation in cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s the driving , so that &apos;s another thing that &apos;s driving a car and learn from the <unk> .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why that &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the testing <unk> .

but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we will do when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that is able to support these <unk> future .
this is a minute <unk> .
i think now , my mother , i think , is kind of a <unk> .

when an ant fell into the rice , i couldn &apos;t see it .

we have a simple camera camera in a <unk> <unk> and making a <unk> through a doctor &apos;s hospital for every patient .
so our revenue has been very much faster , which has a healthy value of value , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re treating for a lot of people .
that &apos;s a difficult job .
for example , we can put digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make a cell phone ?
it was as though she couldn &apos;t see me as if i was invisible .
and also , no one ever had a <unk> <unk> or seen this particular act of view of this , and this particular act of view of life , is knowing , because now they have this concept in your head , and you know , now , you have this concept in your head .
like bp , the hole is <unk> , at least , not without an enormous cost of desire .
don &apos;t be ashamed of that .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth of this country that created our limbic system , a system that can &apos;t survive without <unk> growth and supplies to not survive .
the oil is not liquid .

over generations , we have our children as we live as a million other species living with us .
but it &apos;s not a normal movie .
but if i was a base , however , i took a base on every pixels of <unk> x 800 , we need 3,000 screens to take 3,000 screens to take a glimpse of the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so he sequenced the genomes of his children .
it &apos;s because there &apos;d be somebody in the audience who wants to stop eating .
imagine in 2016 , the foremost <unk> <unk> of the <unk> tax of tax revenues , but also their personal genome .
and so i &apos;m all going to make you , <unk> and to make the genomic revolution that &apos;s happening around you .
and we have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a special <unk> that &apos;s inside of the solid part of the <unk> and the contours of the hip .
hopefully this technology will enable us to see more in the future of the survivors .
in the twig , what the sample is the sample of the gas , and <unk> it dies .

the patterns of dots that i showed you , actually , actually , what &apos;s symmetries of this <unk> <unk> <unk> , moving and on the <unk> space-time .
and we &apos;ve heard about history from the human race of humankind through genetic <unk> .
in the <unk> , we find a lot of examples of compassion , but for love , for love and real altruism .
most important , i think , is it with little groups of women to work with them the opportunity to give you the picture of <unk> .

i lost a child 15 years ago , a second when i was 16 .
i know what it means to suffer , and if you &apos;re a crime , one person should be a fair of <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
but what if not that would not be like that ?
after a few decades , i was thinking , but eventually i was here , but the <unk> .
so that &apos;s what happens .
okay . the <unk> is used by thousands of people around the world .
or we could use one of these here .
mao tse <unk> described her as a cultural civil civil war , and that &apos;s probably a <unk> description .

but this is not more of the case .
the <unk> of nations , well , we always had .
but now , one last thing .
but if you &apos;re today , the <unk> question , what the optimal formula for a long life is , it &apos;s probably not saying it &apos;s not .
it reminds me of my college time .
and research shows that these years of largely free diseases are heart disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .

and for a while , we looked at the <unk> <unk> to where there &apos;s actually a high proportion of <unk> .
instead , they talk about the next trip into nature , they run recipes , and yes , they pray .

so often , amateurs , no experts , the inventors and <unk> of things like mountain , like mountain mountain , <unk> , computer airplanes , <unk> , <unk> .
then , computers were even big , the only scientists were interested in , and no one ever dreamed of it , one of them , to have a home .
you just have your own eyes to come up with it .
i mean that it was already seen .
we &apos;ve got the driver &apos;s driver &apos;s <unk> and studied .
and i said , i can &apos;t bring them , but i can put them in zero gs .
we had four <unk> and two nurses in the airplane .

no life , from the smallest life to us all right , if you can &apos;t make these little <unk> .
i <unk> on <unk> . i went regularly .
i didn &apos;t change my i.q. . my iq was not down .
i was a writer .
so basically , no one would be willing to accept if your child doesn &apos;t survive .
and then we decided why not the religion use , because in philippines , the catholic church was quite strong , and <unk> are buddhist .
we did a first job in 1975 , and the women we were organized , and the women were organized , &quot; we want to borrow the family planning for family planning .
you can call the coca-cola kind of reasoning , if you like , it &apos;s the same thing .

you can see the spikes clearly .
the challenge for the <unk> player is , whether it &apos;s a few , is fair or not to give him a little commandments to the one that &apos;s just given one or two dollars .
now i &apos;m going to ask you some of them .
we can try . maybe we &apos;ll .
so what do we learn today ?
about 10 calories , about 10 calories to feed a food that is to consume in the west .
how did a <unk> ?
and in the east , in the east , in <unk> , they &apos;re offered to sell . that &apos;s why it &apos;s <unk> .
and at that point , our relationship changes completely , both of the food as well as the cities .
the word &quot; jihad used to be thomas moore .
<unk> piles of <unk> .
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat .
she is the source of all morality , this is the <unk> act of <unk> himself to sit at the point of another one .
and i see that this is a very hard intelligence , not just a <unk> feeling .
in the present phase , we have a <unk> -- and two years &#91; unclear &#93; half a million parts , quite complex , new and exciting technologies from steel , concrete , glass , glass .
the next project is that i think the passive nature or the passive nature or the passive .

when i was in <unk> , wisconsin was , i was considered a public lecture in front of a group of students .
so often , we &apos;re looking for <unk> of respiratory disorders like flu .
there are <unk> everywhere around us , and it &apos;s just waiting to be discovered .
could we turn the light off , so we could see it ?
so we &apos;re <unk> chemical <unk> that are different . our kind of chemical <unk> has universal .
but there &apos;s got to say -- and i &apos;m going to bear , richard -- i &apos;ve never liked biological <unk> , and i think we &apos;ve got a few hundred million years of , and i think we &apos;ve got to work with a few hundred million years .
everybody &apos;s talking about things about what &apos;s a reduction in the <unk> to <unk> any price .

one of the zones next to hong kong is written by the <unk> .
people can come to live under the charter , but nobody is forced to .
so much of those who understood the idea of the <unk> , that people can share with rules .
how would we write such a <unk> ?
and you thought about genomics , a little more than 10 years ago , you know , you could have to end up with three and five genomes of the year ; it &apos;s already hundreds of thousands of them .
if there &apos;s lots of chlorophyll , you &apos;re very much green light .
the number of genes that &apos;s a little bit of the common genes that we ignore a <unk> parasite ; it &apos;s got larger if we were focused on certain genes of genes , on about <unk> .
it adds its genome to a dose of radiation , through the <unk> of little bits , and they were <unk> together , in 12 to 24 hours .
let me wrap up with the ethical and political research .
of course , the reason is worth the <unk> .
we call them &quot; <unk> . &quot; you focus on what &apos;s going to be .
and it &apos;s also true . i grew up as a poor child &apos;s family family in the south bronx in the south bronx , everyone lived in the past and in the present .
let &apos;s take an area of medicine .
here is a beautiful image of the <unk> , the largest <unk> in my milky way galaxy .
it &apos;s cold , <unk> and <unk> , maybe it &apos;s <unk> , and maybe they &apos;re standing at the bank of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i can &apos;t tell you how that was the first images to see the beginning of the spacecraft from the spacecraft , and this was what we saw .
so here we see a film of titan <unk> that shows these dunes , and these dunes are 100 feet high , and they have a total <unk> of <unk> and extend miles and miles .
so far , the earth is still the only planet , where we know that it &apos;s all about life .
they had lost 40 percent of their land , and they were used to have been <unk> , so they had no free access to the rest of the bank .
<unk> : this is a <unk> <unk> .
so we have a picture .
it took me four days .
and the rest of the brain is made out of nerve .
and in fact , you can actually find cells cells that are in the hippocampus , the same way that the <unk> are perceiving right away from borders or edges in a certain distance , and the mouse , if you study the environment .
and this would be represented by the fire of the <unk> .
he was not the only man who suffered from a school of america , and he was not the only great great speaker of his time .
and why should anyone care about this ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thoughts and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s look at it .
and if you talk about what they believe , they will attract the people , who believe what they believe .
the reason for that people bought an iphone in the first six hours to be six hours in the queue , and she was your worldview , and she &apos;s the will , you know , they were the first .
people don &apos;t buy what they do , they buy why they do it . and what they do is just as evidence of what they believe .
and , by the way , he was holding the &quot; i have a dream &quot; i have a plan called &quot; <unk> . &quot;

when this was the office in <unk> in washington , d.c. , the <unk> hospital <unk> , they were <unk> .
and we decided to use recipes to this purpose .
what if we had an waiting room , you just get the <unk> , if you &apos;re sick , but you get sick , but you &apos;re going to be getting healthy .
and they leave that with belief , the capacity and the efficiency , our most basic hopes in public health care .
i think that &apos;s when we grade our health care , it doesn &apos;t be the sick of the sick that were cured , but it &apos;s being measured , but the diseases that were avoiding .
and the contributions is a real danger of the world &apos;s whole , but this is in the indian ocean .
we caught it with this <unk> , <unk> , six metric of them .
eighty-five percent of you cannot read , if you enter the afghan cliff .
multiply the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , like safety , in the world , can be created entirely different .
i really do .
remember , this is a fun thing to remember when the <unk> were . you know , count the points for al gore , count the points for the bush . count me again .
the circle represent the countries .
some countries had already been statistics .
but we need to have to go to the united states of the world to find the same health care that we have today on the philippines .
so that changes gradually .
this looks like a happy story .
what you make -- at which level you &apos;re living -- it &apos;s how it &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s about food .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of the developing world that we have , argentina , and we &apos;ve been <unk> by 50 years ago , and i said that this was a bad thing that was very developed .
governance . a working government -- this led to california from the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i showed the approach to how seemingly impossible possible .
and the enemy is quite weak .
we &apos;re -- despite <unk> -- with <unk> in afghanistan .
&quot; but it &apos;s not an ideal world . &quot; &quot; and your government doesn &apos;t step closer . &quot;
