you know , one of the great <unk> trips in the travels and is one of the joys of the research research , along with the people who can remember the old days , which is still in the wind of the wind stones , they still feel the <unk> of the <unk> stones .
and just knowing that life is still beyond the milky way , or the importance of the <unk> , or the importance of the <unk> , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist revelation of the <unk> , which is the idea of a group of <unk> <unk> , which is the idea that the world we live in , not in an absolute sense of view .
and of course , we all share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we get children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to be <unk> by death through the death of death , and so we didn &apos;t know that we all sing , dancing and creating art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> in the woods in the woods , or the <unk> in the woods , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or the <unk> in the middle of the sahara , and this is what i &apos;ve traveled to a month in the desert .
all of these people are teaching us that there are other modes of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the orientation on the earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , only with hope .
together , these hundreds of thousands of cultures are a network of <unk> and <unk> lives , which is the earth &apos;s system , and that &apos;s what &apos;s important to the earth &apos;s as important as the biological <unk> device .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and i think of the <unk> of all thoughts , exciting ideas , and <unk> , and <unk> , that &apos;s the human imagination for the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humankind .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we are as an amazing species of species .
and the same thing that biosphere was wasted was this with the <unk> -- just at the same speed rate .
not a biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all these species are dying , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of the biological diversity of the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity .
and the key implication for that is the extinct languages .
as each of you were born in this room , we talked 6,000 languages .
now a language is not just the whole of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture has given access to the physical culture of the world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , an inflection point , a beautiful spiritual opportunity .
and from those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , that &apos;s where half are not <unk> into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not going to be taught anymore . meaning if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely as the silence of being <unk> , one of the last of your people who speak to your language , no way to have no way to expect to expect to expect to expect ?
and yet , this terrible fortune actually happens to somebody somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older man , and she takes the last <unk> of an old language to the grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; if the world is not a better place , if we all just speak one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would suddenly see how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
and so i want to take you through a tour of a trip through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to understand how to make you understand what was lost .
now , there are some of us who &apos;s kind of forgotten that when i say , &quot; different ways of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
take example , take this kid in the northwest of the amazon in the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the east in the belly of saint snakes .
this is a people who &apos;s not <unk> between the colors blue and green , because the forest is being dependent on the forest that people depend on .
they have an <unk> language , and a <unk> called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry somebody who talks to another language .
and all of the time in the <unk> past time , the <unk> of these big houses , which is to be talked about these big houses for six or seven languages , but that you never hear somebody who learn a language .
they &apos;re just listening to speak and then .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that went back in the year &apos; 50s .
in the year in 1957 , making five <unk> contact contact , and made a <unk> mistake .
they took a <unk> photograph of the air , what we &apos;d like to grade as an friendly symbol , and they forgot that these people have never seen anything in the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face of the face or the character , they found nothing and killing the five <unk> of cancer , and killed the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> <unk> was not just <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we monitored eight generations back , and we found two instances of a natural death , and when we asked people to do a little bit about it , that &apos;s one of the people that died so old and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time they had a clear invasion of forest , which was amazing .
their <unk> could smell the urine of the animal at 40 steps , and determine the animal species of that owned .
in the early 1930s , i got a really amazing job when i asked my professor at harvard professor , whether i was interested in the <unk> and the secret societies to infiltrate the <unk> of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the poison that was used to be used to make it .
now , to give you a sense of <unk> , i had to know something about this remarkable belief in this remarkable belief , and <unk> is no cult of the black magic .
the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of reasoning .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them , the great world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , christian , <unk> , whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because the guess was that there &apos;s no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , and of course , there was a little <unk> of this very profound religious thoughts that <unk> <unk> in the tragic diaspora .
but what makes interesting interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living of the living leaders .
ghosts can be <unk> by the big water , respond to the rhythm of the dance , to endure the soul of living in the living of the living , so that the <unk> is going to be a <unk> .
<unk> people say , &quot; you know , &quot; her white goes into the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with it , you &apos;re going to take your mind . how can you damage ?
you can see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal without <unk> <unk> , an amazing feat of the mind of the mind of the mind , that it &apos;s <unk> , when it comes in a state of extreme arousal .
well , from all the people i met was the <unk> of the sierra nevada , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the most remarkable .
offspring of the ancient <unk> civilization that <unk> the <unk> of columbia , and in the aftermath of the conquest , this people &apos;s leading to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that had never conquered the <unk> .
to the day day today , they become ruled by a ritual priesthood , but the training is very extraordinary .
and the boys are <unk> at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at the base of the glacier for 18 years , and two periods of nine years , to <unk> , and two periods of nine years , he chose to <unk> the nine months of pregnancy .
and while this whole time , they will be culturally culturally involved in the value of their society . values that maintain the claim that their prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , she &apos;s going to be taken out of a day and the first time in her life , at the age of 18 , you see a <unk> , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness , when the sun begins , he &apos;s <unk> and says , &quot; you see ? &quot;
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers to be responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and whenever we think of it and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> and <unk> and the old portion of the <unk> of the very <unk> , which is a <unk> idea , and you say , these people are connected to nature , as we are .
so , they &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re not going to overtake the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of space for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but you still have a mystery of time and ritual and ritual a mystery <unk> of the earth , which is really shaped to be close to the idea that the earth is going to exist .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid out of the andes , which is growing up in the belief that the mountain is a <unk> , which is your own fate of being able to determine a very different person , and a different relationship with this resource or that place , as a little child in the montana .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a bunch of <unk> is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor that is the relationship between the individual and nature .
i was growing in the forests of <unk> columbia , and i believed that these forest forests are being there to become <unk> .
it made me to another person as my friends who believe in the <unk> , who believe that these forest forest is the <unk> and the <unk> ghosts , and the <unk> ghosts are the <unk> of the world , ghosts that they would participate in their <unk> .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful <unk> of the repertoire of <unk> .
what <unk> is so fascinating is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> out of two different sources . on one side , there &apos;s a blue <unk> smoke on their consciousness with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this plant contains some very powerful <unk> of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> <unk> , how they <unk> this stuff , this substance that they &apos;re producing in various ways .
this powder is a <unk> of a <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i actually got to my professor , richard evan <unk> , the guy who was the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magical mushrooms in mexico in the 1930s , and i argued that you could not be able to be able to experience this <unk> as a <unk> .
but the thing with the <unk> is that they can &apos;t be drowned <unk> , because they &apos;re <unk> by a human <unk> called <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be <unk> with some other chemicals that the mao <unk> .
so what &apos;s fascinating is that the <unk> are the <unk> that are in the <unk> , <unk> of exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . so they ask themselves .
how can these people come from a formation of 80,000 species , these two <unk> are not related to the plants that create a kind of <unk> version , so that &apos;s what &apos;s bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which it turns out to be meaningless .
but when you ask the indians , they say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 varieties of <unk> , which is all the way that you see all of a distance in the forest that looks for our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them , as you &apos;ve looked at her <unk> and you say , &quot; i thought you understand something from plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that one of the 17 variants you take in the <unk> and you &apos;re singing to one in a different <unk> .
well , this is not a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
well , the problem is that even the people who have the sympathy , even those of us who have the sympathy , they seem to look at the <unk> and <unk> and look at the past world as the real world , meaning our world .
so , the fact is , you know , the 20th century , in 300 years , in 300 years , or technical innovations , but rather than an era where we &apos;ve been present , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on the planet either need to predict .
all cultures have been involved in their dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> couldn &apos;t heard less to the sioux , as they <unk> and the following tasks , when americans win americans , when they win the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology is the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you move around in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the doom of death , and these are dynamic living peoples in the horizon , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the forest of a <unk> <unk> .
or if we go into the hills of tibet , where i work a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of people &apos;s general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people , not just not <unk> , but generally being celebrated as a part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you have not experienced it at a <unk> level .
i &apos;ve been traveling by a young colleague of 6,000 miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear . 6,000 <unk> <unk> that were transformed into rubble and ash .
the father of this young boy was identified as followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion instantly .
his uncle fled to their holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was incarcerated as punishment for being punishment for the crime .
he was at the age of two years in prison in the age of two years , because she could not live with it .
the nurse , who was these brave <unk> , became a <unk> .
one day , she stepped down on a <unk> <unk> , and for those <unk> , she had to be <unk> for seven years .
the suffering is <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of man is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really want to be a choice , and we want to do in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist before she died , that it &apos;s the greatest fear that , while we &apos;re moving towards a thread , <unk> world , we &apos;re not just going to see the entire range of human imagination to see the <unk> of a dream of thinking , but that &apos;s where we &apos;ve ever been going on .
and it &apos;s <unk> to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and that moment the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of the priesthood of priesthood and hierarchy , specialization , specialization -- only 10,000 years ago .
the modern world world as we know it &apos;s almost 300 years old .
well , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the ensuing millennia .
if we <unk> these kinds of <unk> after the meaning of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be the possibility of what we are : people with deep consciousness that are aware of the importance of the importance , that all people and gardens have to be able to overcome a space . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took across the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of our regime , they were forced to move into settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s the old guy refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the instruments .
now you need to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they used to use them .
the <unk> of her <unk> were originally made of fish that was made in <unk> .
the grandfather of the man &apos;s grandfather was not before the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out outside , he made his pants out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and when the breeze were closed , he formed them into the shape of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the side of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a contractor , took the skeleton of the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> another dog on the knee of the belt belt .
so you can do anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of resistance and all native leaders in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit , in april , in 1999 , the complete control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , is a state that can look for people and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to that distant goals of the earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not even away .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that &apos;s been <unk> in time , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids are , like the dreams of our own children &apos;s geography .
what we ended up with national geographic is that we think politicians will never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we probably have the best institution for storytelling in the world .
<unk> nations send our <unk> .
our papers are <unk> by millions .
and we do a series of trips to the <unk> in which we have to take our audience to places of such cultural adventures , that they &apos;re <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> and hopefully , you will find the world &apos;s central revelation of anthropology : that this world has made it in different ways to make a <unk> <unk> world .
thank you .
so what i first is , as quickly as possible as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;re going to give microsoft is a bit of a year ago , <unk> , and it &apos;s an environment , where you &apos;re either locally or taking a huge amount of visual data .
we see a lot of , many , many of the census of digital photographs that you put in and continually <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at is how big these links are or how big the images are .
most of you are a digital photograph of a camera , but this is an mri scan from the <unk> , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing is that the performance of a system is the number of pixel on your screen -- it &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like that , that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not image .
maybe this is an artificial type of reading .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium of scales .
we also have something to do this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them .
or other models , or even technical secrets .
and this is actually making these ideas , these constraints for the available room on the screen .
we hope that this is not a <unk> and other nonsense , which should not be necessary .
of course , that &apos;s what &apos;s the really <unk> applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time except to say that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
<unk> at the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get another different .
now , this is live in the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research research company , which is a very good research professor by <unk> washington , under the advice of steve <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research became a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
and you can see that when we create these kinds of views that we can penetrate through images , and this experience of <unk> resolution .
but the spatial part of the images is here in the act of meaning .
the <unk> have been presented with these images in the real space that these shots were made up by the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> in the canadian expressway , you see , and you see elements of <unk> slides , and these things were all together in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are what you are much more <unk> .
i would like to go straight through one of the <unk> data data from a early prototype , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer , to show you what i think it is really the punchline behind this technology , and that &apos;s not necessarily obvious , when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to make ourselves worry about the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral notre dame , who &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr , and they &apos;re just notre notre dame in flickr and you &apos;re getting pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> , and each of these orange scenes is represented by this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in the place in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception guy here .
and i suspect you can see that this many different types of cameras are : all this is from the <unk> to professional professional <unk> , a very large number of them that were all <unk> in these environments .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
many of you are <unk> by faces .
there are a bunch of photographs here -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by dame dame , which was right .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it will now collected data from all of all of the collective of the collective memory of it , like , visual is the earth -- and everything will connected .
all these pictures are connected to each and it comes something larger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes from all the earth .
consider this as the legacy of the work of the work of stephen <unk> .
and this is something that &apos;s going to grow through the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s going to use it to the users of the users .
their own pictures will be traced a lot of the other person to have a different person .
when someone did the effort , and you &apos;ve got all of these holy notation , and you know who they &apos;re all , then my photo is , then my photo , and i can use them as a starting to dive into this space , and i can use them as a starting to take place in this space , and so you can use the pictures of other people .
and of course , <unk> , all of these are the very powerful virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , which is not just by <unk> or <unk> and so on collective memory .
thank you .
and i understand them right ? the software enables that to be in a particular time , within the next few years , all of the images that are used in the world in order to deal with each other ?
yeah . it &apos;s not different than you discover .
if you want to make it <unk> between the images .
and she &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the <unk> information that have many of these pictures .
so , as if they do a <unk> for pictures , where they enter sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information that &apos;s picture .
but how would it be , if the image they &apos;re connected to all their images ?
then the scope of the <unk> is <unk> and the abundance that makes it really huge . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , this is really incredible . so congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , like i hope , in unison , you &apos;ve heard them , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed this .
so i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to maximize the <unk> of our citizens , this is particularly through the <unk> of the liberty of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , good , a <unk> of the human .
if people have freedom , every one of us is to do the things that maximize our public and no one has to choose to decide .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices you have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more , they have more stringent .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it &apos;s not going to be able to question it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress enabled .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> in my local supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> at the 10 different <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy a large number of <unk> <unk> , in the unlikely case , not the <unk> in the store for them .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store around a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in this one electronics are so many <unk> plants .
we can put millions of different technologies out of the components of the components that are offered into this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other domains -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because if i was a boy , you could have the phone , as long as he was , as long as he was .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
so a consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we almost have an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phone cell phones .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it until now , you can surely be sure they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and ask them to ask that question .
now , you know what the answer is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that &apos;s not too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more nuanced than the buy of objects , the same explosion is the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could make a better or we could make b .
one has these benefits and risks .
b has got these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what am i doing ? &quot;
the doctor says a lot of these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doc , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
so the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , the burden of the burden of responsibility for someone knows -- <unk> the doctor -- to someone who is not knowing and probably the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , that if you think about it , all right , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you take care of us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you &apos;re expecting to call the doctor on the next morning and ask to request a change .
something that &apos;s as <unk> as our identity is a question of the choices .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity , we invent it .
and we invent as often as we want to .
so that means that every day you wake up the morning , you need to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost everybody had one and fast <unk> as they could , and then quickly children , as fast as they could .
the only real choice was , &quot; who , not when they did , not what they did .
nowadays , it &apos;s all just too .
i teach marvelous intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged in other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ? &quot;
am i going to get married ? should i just get kids , or just a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether it &apos;s all the tasks that i &apos;m not going to get to you and get a good note in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl has demonstrated , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner from that i &apos;m not going to tell you the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , again , and again , whether we should work or we should be working or not work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our phone cell phone on the hip , and our blackberry , and our laptop &apos;s own hip , and our laptop would probably be on our own lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in which we &apos;re <unk> at our child &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it will be your experience of the <unk> of your child &apos;s child &apos;s child .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , tangible things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we were living in looked like this .
so i want to say that there was a few choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> sense , is that he &apos;s <unk> instead .
so with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you an extra <unk> example of a study of investing in volunteers .
one of me had access to me had access to <unk> <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 jobs .
and what she was found was a 10 year-old <unk> that took the employer to two percent .
they &apos;re offering 50 megabytes of -- 10 percent less than if they &apos;re just going to offer five , why ?
because there are 50 <unk> of <unk> who are to choose to decide how to choose it in the morning .
and then tomorrow morning , and tomorrow morning , and tomorrow , of course , is never going to happen .
you know that this is not only true that people need to eat food , if you go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to have the decisions that are so hard , they make the decisions so hard .
by not going to participation , they give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> , who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s what the world looks like .
you want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want the wrong investment to choose , or at all the wrong <unk> .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we get the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with a decision of choices , as if we gave the opportunity to choose between less choices .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is being driven by the big choice of a lot , if you buy a buy , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that &apos;s just imagine that they could have a different decision , and what happens to be a good decision , and what happens to be a good decision , and that regret looks like that .
the more opportunities there is , the more powerful it &apos;s easier to regret is the <unk> for the choices you meet .
secondly , what economists call authenticity .
dan gilbert has a great point of how to tell how much the way we evaluate things about how we evaluate them .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to remember , it &apos;s easy to think of alternative traits that you &apos;re willing to do that , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got less miserable with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here is what you should have .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for himself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could plug right away from my house . &quot;
and he spends about two weeks from the thought he &apos;s missed the way , day , day , day a great parking lot .
<unk> takes the satisfaction that we get from our choices , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are more choices , the more attractive properties of this selection will take consideration in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is some statements .
he &apos;s making a point of life in now and maybe to do things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is , always , who you decide to do , they don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things may have lots of sexy qualities , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : expectations of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to share my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which it gave them a kind of like a kind of like , and they bought them , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they &apos;ve got long enough , they &apos;ve got enough enough to have enough time .
so in order to buy new jeans for many years of the <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want <unk> , light <unk> , right ?
do they want the buttons or <unk> ? stone ?
do you want to stick with the holes ?
you want to be <unk> , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my pine tree was down , and after i said , i said , &quot; i would like the way to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what was that , so i spent an hour for all of these damn jeans , and i went to the store -- and i tell the truth -- with the best appropriate thing that i ever had .
i had better . all those choices allowed me to do better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
and the reason i was bad for me was that , with all these options , my expectations of what a good couple of jeans is , went high .
i had very low expectations . i had no expectations than it was in a way .
as you walked in 100 species , you know , one of them should be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i was going to do , and what i was expected , and what i was expected was compared to what i expected .
so the add of opportunities in the lives of the people will inevitably inevitably the expectations of the people that are going to be well .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even if the results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows , because if you didn &apos;t know it , you know , you know all this .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it was all better than anything that was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experience of a pleasant surprise .
nowadays , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , and we &apos;re wealthy , and that &apos;s best for you -- the best thing you ever hope for is doing things as well as you expect it .
they &apos;re never going to <unk> <unk> because their expectations , my expectations .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all got -- the secret to <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t make it better . i haven &apos;t <unk> myself .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of a <unk> sitting on , if you can only buy a kind of a way , that if you &apos;re always unhappy , and you wonder why who is responsible . the world is responsible .
if hundreds of different types of women are available , and they &apos;re buying a <unk> , and you wonder why who is responsible ?
well , it &apos;s also clear that the answer is : you know .
they could have better do better .
with 100 different types of jeans , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of choices are good , they &apos;re willing to be disappointed .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> of this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the <unk> because their standards are so high . and then if you have to explain those experiences themselves .
and so the thing is that it &apos;s <unk> that we generally get better , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> that we &apos;re all right for right now is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question to make a difference better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices better than a little choice .
there &apos;s a magic lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time to make our responsibilities .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing that &apos;s about to think about the way all of these choices are in the developed societies , the richness of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we heard about many of them whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating is , steve <unk> , you know , steve <unk> has told you about how these expensive and hard car seats are not help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i tell you is these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurts .
they worry that we &apos;re bad at that .
if something of the people that people have allowed to make decisions that would move to their societies in which people would move to little 401 dignity , it would not just improve people &apos;s lives , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a <unk> app .
<unk> is going to worry that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are <unk> .
so finally , you &apos;re reading this cartoon , and , you know , a powerful person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know it &apos;s not possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the point of the fish , the fish i know .
because the truth is , if you break it down , it &apos;s all possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break it down , it &apos;s so that everything is possible , you pay your satisfaction .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with perfect certainty -- potentially for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of an iranian <unk> is a recipe for <unk> , and i suspect disaster disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what could mean , and what could mean , and over the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;re digitized biology , and now we &apos;re going to try and create from the digital code into a new phase of biology to create new lives .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask considerable questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think a lot of biologists have tried to understand , and at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to try and simplify them up to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve got almost 20 years of digitized , as we sequenced the <unk> , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world .
now let &apos;s try to ask if we could regenerate life or whether we can create new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , <unk> <unk> , which is the minimal genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a little smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that they are .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , in comparison , trust me , and trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we all look at these genes that we can take from one to the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that we &apos;re going to lead this to a living cell .
and so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome , what allows us to synthesize the individual components and make some of those fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
so does it allow the chemistry to create large molecules that hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
so a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps are exponentially exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but it &apos;s still accelerating . and our last point would sit on an exponential curve .
we started with 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years ago with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
and it turned out to be very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of play , more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together , and we could correct the mistakes .
so that was our first trial , starting with the digital information called the genome column x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
so we made little bits , and we had a <unk> and had a mitochondrial molecule by about 5,000 letters .
so the exciting phase was when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and put into a bacteria , and that bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were raised by the cells , and they came back and kill e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were able to figure this model exactly .
they laughed more than you do this .
so we think that this is a situation in the building of the software , actually , in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome . it &apos;s got more than <unk> <unk> genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re doing it in cassette samples from the size of the virus we could see the size of the <unk> .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to start with digital data , this digital information is going to be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first in 1995 , the <unk> had been a mistake for 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
some part of the design is to create pieces of that 50 letters long , and you have to overlay that with other parts , to build smaller and smaller <unk> .
we have some unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 amino acids , and there is one single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases .
at first , we signed signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so that we could easily capture them with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair these and back together .
and we started creating pieces , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters , put these together together in order to make these each other together to <unk> those together .
in every time , we &apos;re producing these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these right large pieces -- over 100,000 pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular molecular biology , and so we went to other ways .
we knew by a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which is using biology to fix dna , which can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of three million rads of radiation to radiation .
you can see , in the upper field , that his chromosome is falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything again was the same thing as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely secure life in space , and i can move around , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a subset of the molecule that we engineered by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;re using the process of using the right design of the pieces of the pieces of the pieces of the pieces of the pieces we have .
this is not a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are shots over a lifetime about six seconds .
this is the publication we &apos;ve done recently .
these are <unk> letters of <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever created by people .
it has a spread of over 300 million .
if we could print it with a <unk> 10 and no distances , it would comprise <unk> pages , just to <unk> these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very easy to deal with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s as much easier when you &apos;re doing it in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out , and you give another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clones .
so , in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we just showed you that you could have a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to the other cell .
so we &apos;re <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . so , in fact , these two are two times as humans and mice . we gave it a few <unk> to destroying all the proteins , and we <unk> it with enzymes to <unk> all the proteins .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end of the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring it to the process .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all species around the second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , or a third of <unk> , each time thousands of them in just a second species .
so people think evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> <unk> that are actually <unk> .
the chromosome that has been in the cell ; we don &apos;t have the chromosomes .
it was <unk> in the cell and realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and we ended up with a cell phone with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> blue because genes we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all of the characteristics of species of species , and they &apos;re completely <unk> into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins change the membranes shifted -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we left .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> , but we can actually move by changing things quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years .
and i have argued that we might be a new shape of the cambrian explosion in which we could give up a massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re from six billion to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today we have three people on this planet for every year in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four years .
we have trouble with food , with fresh water , medicine , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s hundreds of millions of clicks to the day .
if we think about biological processes or any process of replacing it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 from that material that goes into the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve now got out of our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of it .
and we &apos;re mapping here in the first line of the biological reality and those of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of these rapid <unk> , to do what we call <unk> genetics .
so we have an opportunity to make a big robot to build millions of chromosomes .
if you think about these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to create <unk> , or drugs new vaccines , we can transform with one small team in which last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can use <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> and so on .
so this is a photograph of the actual <unk> that we &apos;re working with in fact , in fact , <unk> new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it is . we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
so we &apos;re focusing on fuels the fourth generation .
now , you &apos;ve just seen corn corn , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> of <unk> and third generation that are pretty soon going to come out to be much greater <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way in biology with a big impact on the cost of the cost of their availability or the limitation of their availability , is when we see co2 as a material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go to cells .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a technique .
but in the discovery of the world , we all have different kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> .
it &apos;s co2 in methane around the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could just be sent to <unk> the co2 into the fuel to make this process .
within a short amount of time we believe , we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , what else ?
but we &apos;re working on the same way that we &apos;re going to use the same new approaches to development .
you &apos;ve seen this year with the flu flu , and we &apos;re always a $ year back in the back , and if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that this can be changed by <unk> vaccines in <unk> .
this is how the future might possibly look at changes with changes , can be accelerate today , synthetic bacteria , <unk> bacteria , and potentially <unk> .
we are light years from improving people . our goal is because we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to you to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who haven &apos;t been there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been done -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions which existed less than a <unk> second after the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine under geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
at this work i work . it &apos;s called the atlas detector , 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular image of the atlas of the atlas and you see the scale .
on 10 last year , the machine was running for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s a huge <unk> in the control room .
it &apos;s an image of the first <unk> that &apos;s all the way around the lhc , then to <unk> the <unk> of the lhc to make a rainfall of particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the largest <unk> , or this , as someone was visiting the google side , and found the front page .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to scientific .
about a week after a week , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires .
these wires <unk> <unk> <unk> when the engine goes on .
well , the engineers are among them , and they say , &quot; no , no . these are little wires . &quot;
they can do that because if you &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re going to be called <unk> .
so , minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand the tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and it &apos;s got to <unk> the wires and <unk> <unk> , <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
well , that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong , if you think that the magnet goes over 20 tons of tons and shifted to about 30 inches .
so we classify about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we will be able to turn it up , and expect to be able to collect the first data on june or some of our journey to figure out what the building blocks are the building of the universe .
well , of course , in a way , in a way , these accidents again have a debate that &apos;s worth of science and <unk> on those boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words of a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who i suspect when he was the <unk> of his <unk> prize , his apprentice was michael <unk> , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human spirit , which is that our scientific imagination are <unk> . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books are my profession , but , of course , is more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , <unk> love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that the ever will change .
but the recent thing is a little curious about my life and my career that has made me to rethink my relationship with this work .
this sort of curious event was that i wrote a book -- a snake named <unk> , <unk> , love -- that was , unlike all the previous books in the world , went out to the world , and a large <unk> , international <unk> was turned into the world .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m treated as if i &apos;m going to be treated .
seriously -- the demise is <unk> .
for example , they come up with me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t worry that they &apos;re never going to beat this success ?
don &apos;t worry about it that they &apos;re <unk> all of their lives and never created a book that could be interested in the world ? never again ?
okay , this is really empowering .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told myself as a teenager , that i told myself that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of previous reaction .
people said : <unk> did you fear , never succeed ?
don &apos;t you worry about the humiliation of a <unk> ?
don &apos;t you worry that you make this kind of craft your life life , and it &apos;s never going to happen , and that you &apos;re going to die in a <unk> <unk> -- your mouth filled with the bitter <unk> of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
and i always had .
and i was scared about a lot more things that no one would ever .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when i think about writing , i think i &apos;ve been thinking about it and ask me , why ?
is this sensible ?
is it logical that should be expected to be expected to do the work that he &apos;s doing is to do the work of the work he feels ?
and what &apos;s going to do with the creative enterprise is that they &apos;re going to make us insecure about the mental state -- in a way that they don &apos;t do other professions ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember no situation at his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked , whether he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it was just not , you know ?
but for fair to be fair -- the group of chemists have won over the centuries of <unk> people &apos;s <unk> people .
we writer , but we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the arts all seem to have to have this reputation , mentally incredibly unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds from the 20th century , the young and often they died by their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> , seemed to be <unk> by their own talent .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books have been killed a little bit more .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
but we don &apos;t even design a little bit , if we hear somebody to say something like that , because we know this kind of books for so long time , and somehow , we have the notion of the world and collectively of course that creativity and suffering from the end -- always the end -- always the end .
the question i want to ask every here is : is this idea for you all right ?
i think you &apos;re going to think about it ? because at only one centimeter -- i feel like this idea at all .
i think they &apos;re <unk> .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we engage our great creative endeavor .
and i definitely know that it was -- in my situation -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark path of reasoning -- particularly in the fact that i &apos;m just in my career right now .
that means -- see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have more 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to be about writing about the world as a job , which was the best success in my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of friends -- it &apos;s very likely to be my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can bring somebody to the morning at the morning , drinking dinner , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d better do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while , for some time , i think i &apos;m struggling to write to write , a kind of <unk> psychological action .
somehow , i have to find from a way to write a positive distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is going to be on the <unk> .
while i was looking for models in the last year of models , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , to see if they could have better or <unk> ideas about how to deal with the emotional risks with creativity .
this is a quest to greece , and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece , rome and rome don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is from one distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown , unknown .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity of creativity .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed , he would have a <unk> , which was going on to him .
the roman idea had the same idea called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a very clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of weird thing that was believed that it was literally in the walls of a <unk> life -- something like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the performer , in the work , was invisible to the work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s a distance , because the distance i talked about -- the psychological feats that protect you from your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artists of the <unk> was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at anything for you . everybody knew you had a <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work isn &apos;t entirely entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so people in the west are really a long time thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s take the human individual to the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery and mystery -- and there &apos;s no room for the unicorn .
it &apos;s the beginning of the general humanism , and people started to believe that creativity is completely entirely by its individual individual .
for the first time in history , people hear these or the artist &apos;s genius , rather than that artist &apos;s genius -- instead of being a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of an naked person that he thinks he thinks he or she was like the <unk> of the pelvis and the essence of all of the divine , creative , <unk> , an <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> &apos;s a little bit of a lot of responsibility to <unk> .
it &apos;s like somebody to request the sun .
the <unk> and <unk> of all the egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations .
i think that this is the <unk> of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , — and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe one age-old understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t make the <unk> <unk> out of 500 years in a <unk> lecture .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience , which is really <unk> scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> -- <unk> , people who are <unk> and apply to their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to say is why not ?
why not ?
because it makes sense as much sense as anything else i heard when it was about to explain the absolute <unk> of creativity &apos;s creative process .
a process that is -- how anyone knows it &apos;s ever trying to make something -- so in other words , in other words , in other words , in fact , everybody &apos;s always acting .
in fact , sometimes he can feel <unk> .
i had recently met an extraordinary american poet , who met the extraordinary american poet , which was now about 90 , but she told me that she was growing up on the fields in the fields , and she said she was growing and listen to a poem on the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
the land on her land was <unk> .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that they could only do one thing as a moment , and that was -- in her words -- <unk> running , <unk> <unk> .
they ran like the devil to the house as she was tracked from this poem , and it was just so that they had to get quickly enough to a leaf paper , and they had to capture it , and they could capture it through the paper .
in other painting , she was not fast enough , and she ran and ran and run the house , and she &apos;s got the poem , and she was checking her , and she said it was going to go to over the land , and she said , <unk> after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there was moments in which they were almost missed .
so she &apos;s running the house and he searches for the paper and the poem , through her , and she reaches a pen , it &apos;s just a pencil , and then she said -- was it as she was going to reach out and get it .
they caught the poem on his tail and he pulled it back to her body and took it on the paper .
at the time , the poem got <unk> , and it was dry on the paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first word .
and when i heard that i heard , i was <unk> , this is exactly how my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i need to get up at the same time that i get up at the same time , and <unk> me , really awkward .
but even in my <unk> , sometimes i have this thing .
and i estimate that many of you have done that .
even i &apos;ve been working on work or ideas that made up a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we deal with that relationship without losing our minds , but in fact in terms of intellectual health ?
for me , is the best living example of how you can create this musician , tom <unk> . i was allowed him for a few years ago .
we were talking about this issue , and you know what ? most of the time of his life , tom &apos;s the embodiment of the modern artist , who was trying to master the <unk> of the <unk> of his own family .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go on a road in los angeles , and there was everything for him .
he was driving at high speed as he suddenly hear a little bit of a melody , which is a little bit of <unk> , for him , <unk> , and he wants them . she &apos;s <unk> . she &apos;s <unk> , but he &apos;s <unk> after it , but he &apos;s <unk> afterwards .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts , these old <unk> <unk> in him , like , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be <unk> by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting into panic , it just stopped .
and he ended up calling all of this , and doing something completely new .
he just looked up in the sky , and he said , <unk> sorry , can &apos;t you see me ?
<unk> : i think i could write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> tonight .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surround him was when he was the genius of the genius , where he was a little bit of anger , and he knew where he came from , and he realized that there was no <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , goofy , weird , weird , a conversation between tom and <unk> , not quite tom .
so when i heard this story , it was also a little bit of the way i worked , and it &apos;s already saved me .
this idea was saved me as i was in the middle of the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell in one of these these regions that we all fall in and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not only bad , but the worst ever ever .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remember how tom had talked to the free sky , and i was trying to .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i talked my comments towards a <unk> corner of the room .
i spoke loudly : you know , you know , you , you know , you know , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not entirely my fault , right ?
because you see i see everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have any more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up here and speed the percentage of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , you know , the hell of the devil .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you the <unk> that i was here today for my part of my jobs here .
because ... -- at the end , it &apos;s like following the following . before centuries ago , in the deserts of centuries , people have gathered up to <unk> <unk> with holy dances -- until dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , it &apos;s very rare , very rare , and one of the actors were actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen you have such a form of performance .
it was as if the time was <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing different as he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before he had done , but everything else was together .
and suddenly , he was no longer in human history .
it was lit up on the inside , and the bottom line , and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
so when something happened then , people knew what it was . they called it .
they put hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
so interestingly , historical <unk> <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came along with this practice , the pronunciation changed over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
if an artist was impossible in spain , something kind of weird : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> glance .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but the tricky part of the next morning , the next morning , when the dancers wakes up and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> psychoanalyst with <unk> knee , and maybe he &apos;s going to never get to the heights of that heights .
and maybe someone &apos;s ever going to call god &apos;s name , if it turns out , but what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> of creativity .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very much as much <unk> when they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of her was from them .
if you just believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life on someone else &apos;s time of being passed on someone else , if you &apos;re ready .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think i think of security in the last months , while i worked on the book that &apos;s going to seem soon -- as dangerous , frightening , frightening , <unk> .
so what i &apos;m going to tell myself is to tell myself if i &apos;m crazy , i &apos;m scared .
not <unk> .
make your job .
it &apos;s continued to be there for your contribution , whatever it is forever .
if your job is dance , dance .
if the shiny divine genius , they asked you , choose for a short moment , decides to show you a sense of wonder of wonders through your effort , then <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance , they dance their dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe in that , and i feel like we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all this , just for you , just to be the mere human love and the <unk> for that .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had nearly three million years of the size of the lower 48 states to be 40 percent .
but this isn &apos;t really pressing enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic <unk> is the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and <unk> in the summer .
so the next slide i show you is a <unk> which is happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is labeled with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the <unk> , this is the annual <unk> of ice in winter , and it <unk> in the summer .
this is what &apos;s called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming is the frozen line for the arctic ocean , where it &apos;s large amounts of carbon dioxide , which is that when it &apos;s <unk> , microbes from microbes to methane .
compared with the entire amount of <unk> substances in the atmosphere , it could double this amount , if we cross those critical point .
already today , there &apos;s a couple of <unk> fields in alaska , alaska from itself .
professor <unk> walter <unk> the university of alaska in alaska is with another <unk> lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it <unk> us .
and one of the reason is this huge heat warmer greenland from north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are considerably higher than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know , the sea level of sea levels are rising here in the sea .
these rivers go quickly .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers announced that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , is particularly powerful in the melt .
this is 20 foot <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , look at the top of the mountain , a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> out of this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this town .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , most of the drinking water is <unk> .
california was a 40 percent reduction in the sierra part of the sierra leone .
this is <unk> .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
this <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic rate of fire .
and the disasters in the world have been a really <unk> and never unprecedented extent to an unprecedented extent .
so four years old in the last 30 years , like the <unk> <unk> .
this is an entirely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , from the american continent western <unk> and <unk> of india where there &apos;s a <unk> decline in the oceans .
the largest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the absence of biggest problem .
the united states are one of the biggest <unk> , along with china .
and the suggestion was to build many more <unk> .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here &apos;s the ones that were collected in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollars last year to promote clean charcoal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas day , i went home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this is what christmas happened .
one of the ads , one of the ads was this .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it &apos;s going to transform our economies .
<unk> , the <unk> is going to clean up a day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and killing workers in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the leader of <unk> <unk> .
so let me just say one clearly . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for public policy has been initiated .
this is one part of her .
we &apos;re seeing climate change as a serious risk for our business .
and that &apos;s why we put it on the top of the top , a major <unk> of offering a <unk> on the way to get the truth via coal .
the fact is coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells too well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s give it to that .
<unk> coal , they heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of coal is the <unk> of the global warming for global warming , which is remarkable clean <unk> .
take a look at this , this is the present , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects all this together is our dependence on <unk> <unk> like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold , new solution to liberate us from this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work back to make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest-growing ways , our dependence upon old , dirty fuels , the <unk> , the world .
the future is here . wind , sun , and a new energy system .
new investment to create good jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african statement : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to go close , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
so i want to start asking you to ask you , at the time of their childhood , when she played with <unk> .
while they realized how to turn the hands down and <unk> the <unk> and moves them , they were actually learning to try and understand problems through understanding and change .
the spatial thinking is intimately connected to how we understand most of our surroundings .
as a scientist , inspired by the way a scientist engineer , with real objects -- together with my colleague <unk> <unk> and my colleague <unk> <unk> , i started wonder : what if we could do a computer , which is , if we could take a computer , which would be the digital <unk> on a flat <unk> ... ...
so this question was so emotional that we decided to investigate the answer and the <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a <unk> computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move to your hand , you can detect each other , you can capture your motions and you have a screen and you have a screen .
much more important : are you physically physically , therefore you can move them around the order of reaching hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> technology .
and when these tools become physical , and they develop awareness of their movements , each other and the subtleties of our <unk> , and we &apos;re able to see the subtleties of our <unk> and entertaining <unk> .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this is <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and if i <unk> it into a direction , the video will play forward , and if i <unk> it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them up next to them , that &apos;s what your interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that they &apos;re nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their motions and slope .
so an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply ordinary gestures on data , like the colors so that you do this with the fluidity .
in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to incorporate color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to be blended .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> a little <unk> .
there &apos;s also a couple of nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the opportunity to see the possibility of fast trial and the results .
here &apos;s me -- this is a fibonacci series , which i &apos;m doing with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that &apos;s kind of a combination of <unk> and <unk> .
and basically , you get every round of applause at random <unk> letters , and as you try to make words , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
then after about 30 seconds , again , again , again , and you get a new <unk> and try to give new possibilities .
thank you .
these are a few kids who came up on a trip to the media lab , and i could get them to try and make it a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; you know words , &quot; and you know what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people that testing it .
this is our youngest <unk> there right there .
it turned out that he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by using the <unk> of the table that shows this character .
here &apos;s the sun .
the sun is .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by appreciating the <unk> , and she &apos;s able to make the characters interact with the characters .
... his own story .
hi .
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying <unk> .
so the last example of that i have now is to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the <unk> of the <unk> as <unk> , bass and <unk> .
each has four different variations ; you can select which you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can recombine in any kind of patterns .
and you put them together by a <unk> , just holding a <unk> .
there are effects that can transform live , like reverberant and filter .
you put it together with a certain note , and it &apos;s going to hire him .
and then more sobering effects like speed and volume , which you put in the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> and <unk> them in a range , and then expand a little more of the vote .
now i add a <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do a little <unk> .
and so now i combine the filter with the <unk> , so i can control the effect .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by looking at the pace of one or another direction .
and now i combine the filter yet with the bass ; it &apos;s more expression .
i can make the sequence while they run away .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan to plan , but can improvise ; they &apos;re <unk> or <unk> .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> by the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new <unk> <unk> that fit better to how our brains work and work .
and today , i had time to show you some of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re on the verge of this new generation of <unk> interacting with the interaction with digital media , which is to bring information into our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m excited to talk about them all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m here .
yeah , what should be <unk> ?
i &apos;ve got to go back a little bit of time , and that &apos;s where the modern molecular molecular molecular molecular .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology now , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a few years , and i started to know because i wanted to know , and i wanted to make it a little bit of knowing what i learned in studying theory .
so that was my primary motivator .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think that molecular molecular biology now is talking about biotechnology , biotechnology , everything that you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now is extremely important , and more importantly , much more important will be in the future .
there are so controversial things like this whole genetically engineered plants in the <unk> .
now , there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> that &apos;s trying to make <unk> , which is the gas of algae .
now , there are also things that are really going to be in the human world , which is most people , but for example , <unk> , which allowed us to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue on endlessly endlessly .
and so the interest of interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going to continue to <unk> .
so what &apos;s why ?
most of you know most people are familiar with this .
computers hack , and then it &apos;s going to be like this media , yes , the hackers break somewhere , and they <unk> data and so on .
so that &apos;s kind of <unk> very sad , because that &apos;s not what it &apos;s not true , what it actually is , actually , what it is , and what &apos;s actually going on .
and that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , brilliant way to solve a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a <unk> , so you can <unk> a question , and how can you make it different , or how can you make it better .
and it &apos;s been <unk> with software , but it &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole bunch of <unk> that &apos;s going to do with <unk> all kinds of things .
and now , even in biology , and there &apos;s this metaphor , and i want this metaphor to take away from synthetic biology , because biology is actually a <unk> code , because it &apos;s a bit of the computer code , because it &apos;s not just a matter of the computer .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it can also be programming , and you can also <unk> it , and that &apos;s what i found , and i find myself quite fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper with you .
it &apos;s actually taken up eight , eight , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from the switzerland , which is with europa and cooperation in india , but now there are now members or active people around the world .
this is an sort of artistic posture , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and in collaboration with scientists and researchers with scientists to make these kinds of technologies and ask them to try and process the creative , there &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
but it &apos;s always all about to find such a <unk> access to this kind of thing that &apos;s going to have a <unk> to do with it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is a network of <unk> a network , which is actually more like a kind of forum where you stop and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical along and also a little bit of <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to ask , yes , <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that have been the popular agenda , has evolved a scene that i would like to leave .
here in the image on the left , you see <unk> , this is a <unk> , so a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit <unk> institution where anyone can be .
kids , old people , all sorts of people are going to go through , they put a lab in the lab , and look at what &apos;s going to do when they do , when they &apos;re doing , when they do .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia here is a group in indonesia , <unk> , which is quite long .
more than those other networks .
and they &apos;re also in such artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , it &apos;s <unk> , and combine it in quite a <unk> way .
a group of <unk> that i &apos;ve met in a while ago , which is a <unk> , which is the way to communicate to the public , what they &apos;re learning in in college , and they &apos;re doing so so on <unk> little actions to explain what &apos;s <unk> .
and i put a lecture on the other image in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of a show .
and that is , yes , this is the most commonly pretty young people , but the only thing that is all the united states , is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and you can also get involved in the society and ask , so , what you do , what you want to do is what you want to do , you know , what do you want to do with you ?
so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need some materials .
you need to have biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you normally understand in the lab is kind of <unk> machines , extremely costly , extremely distant , just for <unk> , trained academics with <unk> and so on .
and our approach was just to say , <unk> , that actually don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every one of every person has a higher technology than most <unk> technology is really so .
and the real thing with this premise of this premise is , for example , brian <unk> in england , <unk> <unk> , has taken a <unk> , a <unk> and , yes , so it &apos;s <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be <unk> bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s a soup is <unk> that he has left too long .
and i was trying to turn that into my lab home , a little bit , and then i would take on ebay on ebay , and i &apos;d like to take on ebay on ebay , which is such as an <unk> , and so on home .
now this shouldn &apos;t be a joke at all .
here in the bottom of the picture , you can see the lab , in <unk> , and so much of the <unk> garage , which has been <unk> , a group in paris , which is a group in paris , which is a very interesting thing to do with it .
and this is <unk> , who &apos;s just mentioned <unk> , this is , sort of <unk> in molecular biology .
and yeah , so you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s where it &apos;s like to do that at the home , to the large larger organizations that are more larger than the larger organizations that are going to do as well as well .
but always the way of the approach that it is going to be easy and to be accessible .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as international group , as we think of ourselves as we were aware of ourselves , and we now have a real shot , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;ve now known the people that are always doing .
and then came from the <unk> website , the founder of the founders , and has said , we need to make a really meet , even real meeting , and then you have a real meeting , one of london , a <unk> 10 , <unk> 10 .
and then , as it was , yes , <unk> , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values , and what &apos;s what is our intention , our foundations ?
and then there &apos;s a <unk> .
so that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just got so his wishes , his wish , and that &apos;s what it moves , then .
there was , in my opinion , a very good code .
and then we don &apos;t plan it , but it &apos;s like , i think , well , i think it &apos;s pretty good , people , people are quite convinced .
and we &apos;ve actually tried to <unk> that in the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not there .
so i think we &apos;re in the <unk> , in fact , one more step further than the <unk> world .
yeah , what kind of projects do we make this ?
a project that i made in switzerland in switzerland was that we wanted to make an optical case or optical <unk> .
so this is , if you &apos;re a beam beam , in a room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid , moving in the liquid and then move into that focus , so that &apos;s what such as a <unk> principle .
it &apos;s really done , this is done in academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , that we might be able to have a webcam , the lens of <unk> , the lens , then you have a microscope , <unk> <unk> .
you can see this down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> laser <unk> the laser and tries to focus on the camera .
and this didn &apos;t work well , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of them .
so another project comes from the french group out of paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do so much such as a <unk> , or something like this , so it &apos;s got to be preoccupied with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he &apos;s got this helmet that built this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum .
and then you could go in the room in the room , at that chair , that helmet helmet .
then they measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought or how they &apos;ve thought they &apos;ve been thinking , they &apos;re all different lights in space .
it was quite quite a <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to copy genes , to import genes , <unk> , fragments that you can make them visible .
so now , if i do this , the <unk> <unk> on the scene of the crime scene , if you go there any <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to turn this way , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to these people .
and the machines that make this kind of thing that are pretty costly to buy the commercially that they buy the <unk> so that they &apos;re going to go on .
and that &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an app of a lot that you can do with it .
and they have two two builders <unk> , and i said , <unk> , that we can make it easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got it from open source , so that this device is <unk> , and they &apos;re now <unk> to the <unk> , and are now the ideology of the <unk> .
i think like six dollars or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not yet , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s going to be very much available in a framework .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i was starting to build was a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , the <unk> , two centimeters or so .
you put <unk> on <unk> , and you put the <unk> in these <unk> , and then i went off to <unk> the <unk> , and then you get the kind of <unk> .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s so my prototype that &apos;s my prototype , but it was pretty funky , so on a branch , it &apos;s got electronics and pressure , and it was the pressure , and it was the pressure of the thing .
and then i took a <unk> and put it to it .
a <unk> , if you make it full of water , that &apos;s enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s like 40 to <unk> bar .
and then with that , you can accelerate the particles , and then they go into the threshold .
and the commercial device is about <unk> euros , or something like that , <unk> <unk> .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically <unk> .
and so this is , at the moment , this is the <unk> of the scene in the scene , so that availability of technology increases , and also the information and the <unk> , that more people can get engaged .
because in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a relatively little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself or saw it .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make a decision to be able to make meaningful decisions in society , and you want to get sued , you need access to knowledge and to the technology .
and you have to do it and understand it to make it and understand it .
and then the <unk> of the world &apos;s open open <unk> and mental science .
so , you know , as a citizen , you &apos;re going to be <unk> with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> ratio of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least officially on the website , <unk> website .
it &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people , as actually exist .
so i know some of you who don &apos;t have .
and these are just the <unk> of individual people .
and partly with these <unk> <unk> , these places together .
and that &apos;s very early .
as i said , <unk> , it &apos;s only started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , <unk> <unk> that are represented around the world .
and we &apos;re hoping , of course , that we &apos;re going to look like that , as well as well as well , we are very much connected to people , so that can also be involved in their people .
and i would invite everyone else to engage with this , and even myself .
it &apos;s not so easy to dismiss , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and enough energy , you &apos;ll get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi .
how do we work people actually ?
this is a question that &apos;s really moved to me as a designer designer , but also in the field of <unk> and all kinds of things in the field of user .
there &apos;s how to run people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media , and so they create an experience of out-of-body experiences .
and i think that the interactive media inside us <unk> cognitive models , cognitive models , so that the paradigm that &apos;s been programmed in our biological memory was very long time , and that we &apos;re just being <unk> through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually think that these <unk> <unk> that you &apos;ve ever encountered is that the future is actually going to be in the future , but in fact , the future is exactly the future .
now , what are actually <unk> models ?
i &apos;m just <unk> <unk> and i &apos;d like to explain to quickly .
to <unk> cognitive models , these are the models that we have in the pre-industrial times time .
to these <unk> models , that we have a principle of natural relationships .
that sounds basically unusual .
and i &apos;m going to take you again , and i &apos;m going to prove you will prove to you an natural relationship with you .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been working on because of these <unk> models that are able to talk very , very <unk> , although we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is <unk> by definition , which is the <unk> of the characteristic , and what of course we say is that we &apos;re not feeling the rate today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place for us .
now , what &apos;s about with virtuality is the most powerful thing in the world .
i want to prove you to prove it .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
we won &apos;t be able to be able to speculate , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen in the moment right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
they <unk> reality , which is quite without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a <unk> for us , for example , for example , the virtual reality of what we &apos;re doing is actually the whole time .
and these assets that are virtual reality that have required the people in the pre-industrial times , and they needed to <unk> the people .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
they had no mass mass .
the only thing that had been her head was her head .
and in this head , they played memory .
in this head , <unk> knowledge , and through these virtual images , the imagination of imagination was also passed on .
and therefore , it &apos;s so powerful in us that we can deal with virtuality as well .
the interesting thing about this is if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time of human beings at the same time , the medium and medium itself was itself .
now , if you continue a little bit more .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there is a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to that again .
the primary tool of <unk> have been rejected since ancient stories .
<unk> , priests , <unk> <unk> , were <unk> to maintain knowledge in stories .
and also , we &apos;re still going to have very , very powerful stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;re still <unk> <unk> hours of <unk> hours of stories .
this means for a kid that &apos;s been around to reach the way that most of his time has spent most of the time of life with stories of stories .
now , we think our love to stories depends on stories of our parents &apos; lap .
no , no , far missing .
this is much further back to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the domain of the interactive media as special is that we have , in fact , is that we have <unk> <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think about it .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the <unk> .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate that way to navigate island , to raise food .
and they did something called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re interested in a little bit of <unk> , you know , you &apos;re a little bit of <unk> .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they used to use these <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the <unk> and the topography of regions could be mapped to songs .
where the language was <unk> <unk> .
so , you know , you &apos;re talking about <unk> and rhythm .
and these sound and this rhythm have got the geology geology , the topography of a region , and of course , it &apos;s also possible that you could be able to <unk> these songs and sit in the left , and they could move back to the right and back to the right .
why don &apos;t we sing the way to come up from a b to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happened ?
it &apos;s the equivalent of the <unk> machine machine .
we &apos;ve looked at this is called <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s the age of the age machine , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s what &apos;s happened .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and their own <unk> of our individual memories .
on the book , the image .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god &apos;s golden <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> of us being <unk> , and it has nothing more to do .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , is so far to say that these mass mass extinctions , he &apos;s like the book and so on , so what we call as mass mass , and so on , what we call mass mass of our memories and so on .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
the <unk> for the machine machine .
what has changed our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the <unk> effects are the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to have more and more <unk> and more <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , instead , instead of remember , we have standardized , very common , distributed patterns of memories of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more .
we have an abstract language .
we &apos;re not going to make the thing anymore in images that are not more in images in images , but we are <unk> them .
we used to use that things happen linear .
and we think the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , like , for example .
what &apos;s left with us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re more <unk> than <unk> very , very much arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had <unk> <unk> , we had the age machine , and we &apos;re going to take this so-called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> and it sounds very <unk> , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , which gives us these possibilities back to explore our capabilities .
this is about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i just want to explain a little bit .
there are technical concepts like the <unk> reality , which is the augmented reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , it &apos;s a concept of what the virtual world with the real world with the real world with the real world , which is called the virtual world system , which is going to be <unk> .
another example is the virtual reality .
so , of course , this is crazy to the context of my presentation , because we &apos;re not putting ourselves in <unk> , virtual worlds , right after the model of the <unk> .
and other other examples are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all this needs the ability to take advantage of what is the fundamental habitat of life .
i graduated in the end , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here .
you might just stand up to get up , so you can pause in pause with the two of the project .
and i brought this project as an example , like this , again , again , the <unk> of the cognitive models .
all this is a game , i have to say .
of course , what &apos;s extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i &apos;m playing computer games , you probably have very likely to be able to do some people in front of some <unk> <unk> or that they &apos;re playing with something with some of them in their hands .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i think is that i discover the outside world , so i see the real world again .
and this game connects to the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize that i have to be so powerful .
you can tell you a lot better , because there &apos;s more much more much more than that .
and it &apos;s about to discover a city by looking at which places are positive or negative <unk> .
and this is how i get from the city to a completely different sense , which i see negative negative and positive zones of a city and then you get a very different , virtual map of a city and a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here is , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that i &apos;m going to summarize my talk , which is the properties and the skills that we have acquired the traits that we &apos;ve acquired a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , and we &apos;ve gone through complex , technological , new products in the machine , and we &apos;re going to move back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be .
i &apos;ve been asked , if this bag is a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m going to <unk> the same thing in there .
but i &apos;m not going to be kind of curious about it .
yes , children are kind of curious about nature or be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a <unk> of the house , so i &apos;m involved in the issue of curiosity and how changes the curiosity too , and why we think we might be curiosity , and we also need to get curiosity , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re concerned with is a <unk> .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
a <unk> about natural user interface design .
now , you &apos;re going to wonder why all the designers are going to be with as natural , <unk> communication of communication , interaction and so on .
and there are only one of these little devices , because the things should be more intuitive , always more and more natural , and there you have to look at what &apos;s actually human beings , of course , which is <unk> or intuitively .
and before the background , i put myself into the domain of natural user interface , which is the next generation in which human computers in the relationship with the human computers are struggling with , how our tools is changing or how the computer would change from the computer to the digital .
so i &apos;ve been engaged with what &apos;s natural or intuitively .
you might have to take a look at this .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , right here , right now , we &apos;re going to move forward to the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern in the <unk> .
every society is a <unk> .
in the beginning , the <unk> through language .
so , you know , you &apos;ve found out that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other cave in the same cave , and in other areas , cities educated , or rural areas , or the villages , and it &apos;s created by <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
so you had to learn from nature , so not a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning about it , and of course .
and that was then saved by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because of course , the living language started to <unk> <unk> in the form of font , which is what &apos;s going on , and then i <unk> it and <unk> it in stone , and i <unk> it .
and depending on how i <unk> , and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story than if it &apos;s a lifetime of that kind of life .
but <unk> , then that font as a <unk> , got <unk> .
and then the next generation , which we actually live in life today .
this is the <unk> and <unk> <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other people have said , are you really crazy when the people start to read , then they want to be able to pick up and pick it up .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation , and the exciting thing is , just a few hundred years , just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re at the moment in this phase of time that we &apos;re going on .
and the <unk> of all of us , of course , is that we see on the one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with absolute transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s the old thinking about the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the <unk> <unk> and no beef phenomena , because i just want to <unk> it , and i want to be <unk> .
and these two worlds just , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing about this , if you look at this , this new society , these <unk> , <unk> <unk> , principles and <unk> paradigm from the outside of the <unk> .
but no more at the local level , but on a global level .
we understand that the weather is global .
that &apos;s the subject ecology is a global global .
not , if i think locally , i think you &apos;re going to be <unk> , and the neighbor &apos;s less organic , it doesn &apos;t work .
that is , from the local village , in fact a global village , with the same principles , of course , of course , are very intuitive , but the total transparency transparency .
so as you knew back in the village , who has what happened to be what &apos;s going on , and when it &apos;s happening now that &apos;s what &apos;s happening now about this expansion of our mobile devices .
it &apos;s that we know that we need globally globally and faster and always better .
so , as it was in the village , it was on the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been busy looking at what &apos;s going on , which is , of course , what we might have , of course , what &apos;s going on , but also instinctively , what does the difference ?
because often people get people , they can &apos;t make it <unk> so that everybody can handle .
so you have to worry about what &apos;s called , and not just changing it , but it &apos;s not going to be better .
and when of course , of course , is something that i can take as a model , and how can i take a <unk> and shape the things that they &apos;re so intuitive , because they &apos;re making fun , because they &apos;re making fun .
you &apos;re going to work , also , as a student , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and this is , of course , what you &apos;re starting to start and look like , and look , right now , i &apos;m just going to go inside the inner self .
and how does it actually look inside ?
so how do we work when we get there ?
and what does , of course , of course , is intuitively , intuitively , and how does our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process ?
because steve jobs once said , you know , you <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something <unk> or intuitively , what is that at the core .
and you know , you know , you see a lot of our seven senses , most of you are just five , right now , it &apos;s already seven , right now , in the next future , is the next to the next , and as an extension of our self .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we use information ?
in fact alone , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
so many use the word , knowledge , but not at all , what it is then to mean .
but i have to understand how to understand , in the nature , when information is information to information , and from information from information and from information , i know how to do things , or of course , i can make things happen to be intuitive ?
and of course , what &apos;s design is about perception .
so we &apos;re looking at this , if i make things , then i can be <unk> as on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can make it kind of intuitive , by doing things .
so much more natural is in a gourd , but i &apos;m going to see , right , where is salt and pepper the pepper .
and if i tell somebody , give me a salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to be thinking about the right , where is what &apos;s inside .
and in the left of the left , it &apos;s very intuitive , and i hope that there is no sugar in there to be salt .
but also our perception of self , how do you think of it .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet changes our perceptions , depending on what context is .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n .
a second circle begins to endure , or associate it .
and then if i add a <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t just see a unity , which is a circle , and then we see a unit , circle , and we &apos;re seeing a <unk> , a circle , a circle , a circle , another circle .
it &apos;s something called <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , which affects us in perception .
important for the designers that have the most semester of the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> the closeness of the continuity and so on .
so often forget about it .
but that &apos;s an essential part of that , if you want to design things , right ?
the next phenomena , which is very interesting that &apos;s what &apos;s very interesting .
it sounds very trivial , but it sounds so exciting when you &apos;re getting closer .
so we &apos;re in front of the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the beginning .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can start looking at the back .
so , you know , they &apos;re an assumption that you see something you can see , <unk> circle .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at first , before we see it before we see it back , back to the back in our <unk> , saying , okay , okay .
i have a big cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what <unk> you want to see .
this is also there , that comes back .
and then again , again , again , because the back in the back of the back , it doesn &apos;t look at the back and you know , you know , i &apos;m going to take you , you know , what you see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so a whole , very smooth process , how things happen and what &apos;s going to happen for these things .
i don &apos;t know who knows this image .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
does anyone see anything ?
a <unk> , right .
once i saw that there is a <unk> in there , you know .
they &apos;re never going to forget , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so , i &apos;ve actually <unk> them now in the <unk> that you don &apos;t see any more patterns , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a long time , and i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a very long time to see the dog in this <unk> image .
and this is the projection of vision , <unk> , see .
now i know it &apos;s now , and now i &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that you see in this , yes , gray is you actually not , but here in this sort of mass mass there was just going on .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know a little bit about three seconds , until i sort of <unk> the present , i can also <unk> very well <unk> <unk> , where i &apos;d always do it with three seconds .
it &apos;s got to process it as a present .
and then it goes into the past , and i can bridge very elegant , like the computer <unk> , if i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s going on for <unk> milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love .
so , if you know that , you know , if you know this , you &apos;re looking at who you look like long , because i don &apos;t take a cure for you , what can happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also quite a remarkable phenomenon .
this is where most of the perceptions we have .
so that &apos;s the first impression that happens in a fast way of fast speed , how we perceive things .
and as we can see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we could sort of regenerate the environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the designers are not only about perceptions about perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but of course , of course , with the issue of <unk> .
so , just like a human deal with certain things .
there &apos;s a little <unk> of the practical functions , so restrictive things or <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where i need to reach .
now , there are also symbolic functions , why is someone in such a little <unk> , where doesn &apos;t matter so much , so <unk> money on money , although it &apos;s not so practical ?
because we &apos;re more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we deal with as a creator , of course .
back to my proper theme of natural user interface and the theme of which , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> always means how can i be able to achieve a certain goal , or how can a users can be in a certain way , efficient and <unk> .
that &apos;s what the norm is .
how can i make a difference ?
i can use it directly , or i need to be <unk> manual or i need to do that i &apos;m like , &quot; i mean , i mean , i mean , &quot; i mean , i mean , &quot; i mean , i mean , &quot; i mean .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
i &apos;m just making it happen differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re looking at that , you &apos;re going to understand why <unk> percent of our current software are very intuitive or not to use <unk> in many areas or <unk> in many areas or <unk> .
and this is an intuitive , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the future , if i wanted to make some technological devices , if i want to make some technological devices .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re going through these new kinds of <unk> , which is the natural user user interface , for example , five times more likely to our goal .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that , if you &apos;re making something of the classical <unk> , you need to take five hours , and with this new kind of natural software for an hour .
so that doesn &apos;t mean that you could probably get four hours to go home , but your employers or anyone , you know , how it &apos;s going to deal with the four hours .
but i want to say , but of course , it &apos;s an accurate <unk> to get certain things .
so if we go into the domain of the software , here &apos;s the first <unk> of the first line of interfaces that were very abstract , where we needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next , the next that we &apos;ve already got to do with the <unk> neural model , or <unk> the software , they worked , because you would have an idea of something that &apos;s a metaphor to do the computer .
so no more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
so this was a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s still much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m doing this as a designer designer &apos;s a lot more common behavior .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i think that this is always <unk> for success , right now , the <unk> of an app .
and then if i &apos;m a step of <unk> into this natural user interface , where i &apos;m a voice , if you &apos;re a voice , using a language , and it &apos;s not a matter of mouse and <unk> to the mouse , i &apos;m still going to drive it up .
so , i &apos;m going to get back to the point , when are the things that are really more intuitive ?
so , if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to take my little friend there and see , what does that mean , what &apos;s the point of view of view , when is now a little bit of intuitively ?
and that &apos;s for us , people are always a bit of intuitively , if i have to think about it .
so it doesn &apos;t want to think of it , but it &apos;s just going to take care .
so the less i think about it , the more the more is it .
and what does that mean for designers ?
so , if we look at that , if we look at that , we can actually transmit <unk> from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use it as a designer .
that is , i can just take an intuitive , a <unk> , a software engineer , and it &apos;s going to make the software central software .
so , of course , it &apos;s the question , what &apos;s the most exciting thing that &apos;s human beings , and now i &apos;ve been able to tell you .
that &apos;s the so-called <unk> .
this is all the use of us and <unk> is an acronym and it stands for <unk> , <unk> , inform .
that &apos;s all of you all the time , but it makes it worse , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> and intuitively also instinctively .
the model is going to be <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used for us all the time , without knowing that most of the time is there .
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to <unk> times from us to activity , so in their sleep , they determined that it &apos;s less often less than a day .
i can now multiply this mental <unk> <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> <unk> .
and through that kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the <unk> , it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> object , but a metaphor of a <unk> .
and this is based on a higher grail of <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i <unk> this up , for example , in which i &apos;m being sucked into the <unk> as a choice , <unk> in the trap it comes up to me , i can look up to me , i can look at it in the details , and it &apos;s <unk> , i can store it or <unk> .
then i can translate this whole thing .
i &apos;m going to give it a <unk> .
they have eaten a little bit of cake .
<unk> : now i &apos;m going to use the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole of all of this , can be able to filter this up and say , just show me all of the type of chocolate .
and once again , an interface which is essential and much more natural .
because i can reach the things like the little bits , <unk> , and they come up to me , is much more natural than if you can make these things to be <unk> , or other ways to make these things available .
imagination is more powerful <unk> <unk> , and with that phrase , i &apos;d like to close to you a little bit , as designers , too , you know , designers need to think about new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for her attention and request .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re a kid , as a baby , is that you care about what you have to take care of what they have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the <unk> , and the more , kind of , will , kind of , will , sort of , will , sort of , will , sort of , will , sort of , will , sort of , will , sort of , will , sort of , you know
and the curiosity don &apos;t learn .
all of these are the ones who are here and are curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
now , i &apos;m going to talk about it , practically all this <unk> , <unk> , 40 years , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you give them a second , two grams about two grams , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus and every day you need two grams .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone bone .
we could just go through the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we did not , we &apos;re not going to take phosphorus .
and amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re talking here with something , which was the <unk> <unk> , but not so much .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years , and already now , through the <unk> world , much more uranium into the environment , than all the <unk> is being used in the world .
in fact , in the last 20 years , <unk> metric tons of uranium in the fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia with children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re slightly harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less trash .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
this is no protection .
this is how i would say , <unk> your child , it just doesn &apos;t throw it three times as five times .
it &apos;s just a little bit of destruction .
if we think of the <unk> from the <unk> to the <unk> , our whole planet will be a <unk> or a <unk> .
so that &apos;s how to think of the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the bottom , first .
in the soil , 60 percent of the <unk> is saved .
we &apos;re building maize , and we &apos;re losing up between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 miles per hectare per hectare per hectare , or on the countryside .
that is , we &apos;re losing at the bottom of the ground , about five times more powerful .
and of course , we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
in <unk> , for instance , is about <unk> twenty percent of the <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , the <unk> will be larger .
this is all they &apos;re in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby takes about six thousand <unk> .
so , of course , we could reduce this 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these <unk> ?
here &apos;s an proof of evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted by the <unk> parts of the pigs .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is , it &apos;s <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think we &apos;re in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you think of people who exist when you say it would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not going to be there , then you &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> .
and so someone tells al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you <unk> a human life , you <unk> the earth .
here is the more you say more <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then , you weigh the ants around four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no way of termites , as far as they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they &apos;re much more adept working than us , and because it &apos;s only three to six months of life , they &apos;re in their weight , in their weight , in their weight , the 30 billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too much too dumb , right ?
and where you see how far we were going to really wanted to achieve and could be , and how sad we are , we can see that we are at all on the earth , you can see that for instance , for instance , is a program to be <unk> , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a tree tree ?
yeah ?
a single one ?
meaning , our whole intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be <unk> as a trees , right ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily , yes ? yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still six times six thousand trees .
you &apos;ve heard about some of the <unk> of trees ?
meaning , all of our intelligence means we want to be disguised as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> .
every year , we &apos;re going to have three million tons of phosphorus , which is going to go back in .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that means we feel so guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> and just like them to go back that our own <unk> back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be successful , less harmful to <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s not going to be there , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
they only have <unk> when they &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t fix it .
we can .
we can regain our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture where we regain the nutrients .
right now , we can look at these kinds of nutrients in agriculture .
so we do this in china , for example , where we take the waste of it .
in china , a <unk> is a <unk> nowadays , so , you know ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb to the nutrients .
that is , the whole western <unk> paints that the city was always taken , but the farmers never have a bit returned .
and in fact , the cities used to grow more because the farmers went into the cities and the cities needed to keep their nutrients away .
all the western empires are increasingly expanding , until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;re always able to <unk> the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat the food in china , you would expect to stay in the food for the food .
because it &apos;s <unk> to go and take the nutrients .
you invited them to dinner , not for dinner .
so , you know , you can see the web , how you can regain the nutrients .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s beautiful about this , if you do this , agriculture , <unk> , on a hectare of land with five in the favelas of five , can make a farmer about <unk> dollars , and they &apos;re <unk> and herbs and herbs and herbs .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the favelas are over over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people very bad .
we can help them be good .
this is , of course , <unk> , but the plants carry themselves .
the <unk> is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design , the design that a farmer can easily .
that &apos;s called the <unk> back .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities were ever <unk> .
you could just <unk> a liter of a liter of <unk> , and then it &apos;s been <unk> for years .
don &apos;t happen instead .
that is , we don &apos;t need to control the people to be very bad .
we can help them be good .
that is , we need to have phosphorus <unk> .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to write , in germany , in germany , at the best <unk> of the treatment .
unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t matter in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> .
because the <unk> facility could be the best part of the phosphorus .
it has to go back .
what we see is that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s done .
we &apos;ve been used in holland for three years .
the dutch government explains , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is what phosphorus is .
but we need all the overall .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s world .
there &apos;s opec a pile of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of control .
and the oil will replace us by other energy .
but the phosphorus won &apos;t replace .
so it &apos;s not about to make the existing existing ratio , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and all of all , first of all , what is the right .
that &apos;s about efficiency , not to efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , because in holland , the land is built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad your wife &apos;s wife , if you &apos;ve got your wife , and you &apos;ll get them with 50 <unk> .
completely inefficient .
but very , very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany ate about six <unk> three kilograms of life .
there .
it &apos;s not a scientific thing , because because we don &apos;t know exactly how much <unk> is going on .
but a <unk> , even in these illumination , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
it &apos;s not a resource efficiency , but efficiency .
so what &apos;s the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better to burn a little bit better and <unk> it to the <unk> and to lose all sorts of materials for low materials , but first time , how do you get ?
think of it .
yeah ?
when i <unk> her dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficiently ?
yeah ?
meaning , everything matters in life is not about saving , avoiding , to reduce .
all the <unk> .
and we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have green green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , right ?
at any point where you &apos;re <unk> , you can , you get <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
as we think about north .
there is every footprint .
if you walk , yes , it &apos;s <unk> the floor .
because the ground is going to die the mosses , and the wind is going to die and water water .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every time you &apos;re in italy , that &apos;s the water that remains longer in the meadow .
so it &apos;s about to create a big footprint that will be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how is your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , <unk> , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , you can kick out of the car .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a bit of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , there are beautiful .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> device that is a liquid fluid .
they &apos;re <unk> , where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re <unk> everywhere .
and it contains seeds seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two loops .
not all of it should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they &apos;re using the use of not .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , that must be so that they go in biological systems .
the things that are just being used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
it &apos;s very direct advertising , and it &apos;s not <unk> for the company <unk> <unk> , but that they &apos;re helping now to help this business .
because we don &apos;t do the things anymore .
yeah ?
so , if i go to the dinner , and you say , that &apos;s free of <unk> , and it &apos;s just not to do anything .
no , we see what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
it &apos;s not toxic .
but everything is , what &apos;s inside , is useful .
so these are the first pair of shoes that you can see the <unk> can go to the <unk> store and the <unk> in the <unk> , right ?
all this is <unk> .
and if it works us , it &apos;s going to work for <unk> , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole industry .
and this is half of all the <unk> globally that are caused by the textile industry .
so that &apos;s why they help people ask for people .
hey , <unk> , are you really serious ?
because those have been twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure if you &apos;re really <unk> .
so , help me give me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been presented .
that &apos;s going .
so we can do things now , if you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can enter into biological spaces .
technical spaces are the same .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological <unk> , in fact , that &apos;s made to go back into the cycle .
so this is the store , so you can <unk> things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
if the moment is the waste .
all these <unk> are around , almost almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the front jump on the <unk> , but otherwise in the landscapes , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that he can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside the inside , then you can just get a baby in israel or in tunisia <unk> trees .
yeah ?
so just if you take these <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> and <unk> the powder to plant with plants .
this is the baby <unk> for the entire life , already at the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s sort of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , sort of .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started a institute .
now there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can be engaged .
there &apos;s an extra association there , <unk> , where anyone can be involved .
so no longer saving , <unk> , avoid , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you do that curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that i was as a <unk> , as a <unk> , so you know , in english <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> notes in <unk> music .
you don &apos;t just have a word for listening to the text in a different language , but also , the deeper sense of words , but to understand the deeper sense of words , everyone has to make a good translation of it knows .
already in german english , can require more knowledge , more knowledge , because when you go to poetry , it &apos;s because of poetry or all about poetry .
so <unk> is <unk> , what we &apos;re doing with a musician &apos;s musician .
and as a marketer , i only started the <unk> notes .
you know , the <unk> of the notes in the notes exactly everything that he thought was there .
in reality , the grades are very different and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly the same or <unk> , like a verbal verbal , albeit very <unk> , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers is not to smell the level of the <unk> , just not to hear the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
that is , the epitome has to set these <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in another , namely , concrete , concrete , <unk> <unk> .
today , i want to tell you what i &apos;m going to translate other other words , which translate into a verbal language .
so basically translation translation .
so i prefer to do it all the time in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to me in english translation translation .
so that the music works for me as much as the spoken speech .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to take you just reading the notes and press the keys on the piano or to press the right thing on the piano .
that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
the point of the letters is , you know , if you can do the language .
so , you need to think of music as the music process , at least as long as the spoken speech .
there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you &apos;re learning it for the <unk> , just passively understands , or you can talk to the muslim speaker .
the work of <unk> starts to look like a <unk> .
once you start to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited , you &apos;re <unk> , you know , <unk> of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the <unk> of the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts , thoughts .
you studied the work that he was before and then composed .
you compare comparison .
the <unk> , it &apos;s writing .
and what does he mind ?
how were the circumstances of the society and politics and politics ?
all that interest me .
you think in time in this time , by example , contemporary images look at or reading literature .
and yet , you know , you know , as an interpreter , you know , as an interpreter , to play the composers that you &apos;re going to play with , and it &apos;s always getting easier to feel in it .
the composer is always going to be a boyfriend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece , is more and more and more to my personal concerns .
now , there &apos;s the notes as a precise record of the cause of composers , but just a framework , i turn this framework , and i turn this framework to make sense of meaning .
so i say to my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> , which could mean these sound .
now for me , for me , for me , for the composers , what you could mean to do it today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself because it comes from my personal <unk> .
it &apos;s got to be <unk> for me in here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to convince that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always again a very happy concert concert , if i could have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve learned as long as i &apos;ve learned how to experience so long .
and as a happy , happy new day you &apos;ve ever met again , although always the same rituals of life , up to the work , they &apos;re going to work as well as the same piece as i always did .
i &apos;ve become a day of older , and i went to slow down , my pulse will be slower at night when the morning , in a <unk> , takes the sound back to home .
i &apos;m going to take you breath of the audience , or unconsciously .
all this influenced me , and all this affects my experience with the composition .
so wonderful is also , if i stand up with a <unk> on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea , and it &apos;s going to be the answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things are happening that we don &apos;t have <unk> , and what you can &apos;t have .
it &apos;s great fun to make music , and they like the audience , then , as the audience is communicating alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this .
i can &apos;t play today as 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , than today , and i &apos;m going to have much more <unk> , emotions and emotion , than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but this is new <unk> .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a <unk> <unk> for <unk> my beloved teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot of too young , so he was <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky enough to meet it very early , and i was able to get to know of my high school .
i was like 17 , when i was attending one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
and he asked me what the introduction of these <unk> was .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and then he <unk> and he thought ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , it &apos;s memory .
he was about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you &apos;ve got dreams , but not significant memories .
i &apos;m going to play this for every couple of years , and always it turned out to me , although not a single note .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because i read something new .
an example of a completely different area , has made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s the same garden with <unk> light .
it &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as she looked at it .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;ve been as much as i was as much as a record with <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he was only <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to look back to the notes , even though i mean , it &apos;s <unk> .
to keep <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
most of all , if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you know , you need to know about the spoken word of speech .
often , the <unk> is yes , you just learn the notes .
you know , you can basically read the word until you &apos;re just talking a word .
you learn the notes to find the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time in time , the way it &apos;s moving into the notes are moving , then the sounds of the music that sounded like music .
if this is happening , the students will get the gospel .
you can &apos;t talk about it in the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s a good thing that &apos;s going on , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f , f , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you .
but even if you put these data , it &apos;s still just slightly technical .
and yet , there &apos;s no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget a little <unk> .
namely , to make music on the instrument , make your own musical ones and feel about it before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learned the singing , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it will not do it .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experiences and the idea of the music to have the idea that it &apos;s about another possibility to bring up on an instrument to sound .
people who &apos;ve never been singing , have never felt immediately immediately with your own body , as it is to form a sound .
so a phrase , with his own breath .
the instrument is the <unk> of our bodies .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> <unk> in the piano to my fingers .
the melody comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm of your dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays is not <unk> with music .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself more music when it becomes a boring .
no need to sing a <unk> whistle .
each of your music becomes <unk> , when you &apos;re always <unk> out of music with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i didn &apos;t sing ?
i ask the question , can &apos;t you sing , a , because they believe they &apos;re not singing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
at two , it &apos;s not too late to start to find out whether you can &apos;t , or learn , how to do these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , right .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve <unk> it , they &apos;re <unk> .
so i wonder how <unk> was that diagnosis ?
do you have a <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , as you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music , and therefore , you don &apos;t want to do failure .
but what i would regret was , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you can see , all of the cases don &apos;t have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t know about classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m going to say , but surely , you can tell you , or not .
because i don &apos;t think it tells you , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t get rid of the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to push on classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them and tell you , whether it tastes you or not .
whether the music is too <unk> or too sweet .
tell me what you feel .
and at the time , they get involved in the time , and you want something more sinister there , or taste is even fine differences .
why am i asking for my audience to listen to the audience .
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force to work .
the foods that &apos;s been eaten by a chef or a chef <unk> , has to be eaten , and not just <unk> .
so you can listen to the music when a music is played .
she &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where adults are active music or at least active music , a child grows up to a child , so it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> to ask , what color does ?
can you play it in blue ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> period , rather than a red red now .
and this is very different as before .
that &apos;s the very first beginning of a personal musical expression .
so the first step is a interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re playing a piece of a hundred , a hundred years ago , or three hundred years ago , or three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have <unk> .
there was at the time that the time gets an instrument at all the time .
it was not invented yet .
i think that bach would have been excited if he had had the <unk> possibilities of modern <unk> .
i can now <unk> the <unk> of the stream to sound on the modern wings to sound which is a <unk> <unk> .
even beethoven knows that he was more heard when he was deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra who has been rejected as a <unk> .
so the composers of the composers rely on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to be audible , what you &apos;ve dreamed of in mind .
and also , what you would think about in mind .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what you might think about .
thank you .
you know what is envy ?
did you know ?
and how does that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drives a <unk> .
if i come , with my little <unk> w , <unk> and me next to get this feeling .
i met something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what would you need to do so ?
this is the first year , the half of the value year .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to do that , &apos; n ?
and then i &apos;m immediately , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , it &apos;s this uncomfortable feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to make these uncomfortable feelings like envy simply to go to the way .
you can also do that with words like <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
i want to tell you something about this mechanism today or something that you &apos;re not familiar with you &apos;re familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard it , if people say , nobody has to build a wall wall .
and then stones <unk> , so he <unk> them .
in a lie like a lie , you see that the number of the good self is saying .
it &apos;s easy to check out it &apos;s easy to make it different .
it &apos;s just not <unk> them .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is to do that , you know , they &apos;re <unk> .
they need a lie to get a <unk> to get a <unk> .
you can get less easy , yes , <unk> or <unk> .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you may know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman .
and this woman was <unk> , the portrait would not see her .
picasso says only .
it &apos;s always more similar .
in this place , if you laugh , you realize how important that lie and how much time you need to experience something to experience something very well .
because artists have a <unk> ratio .
and the artists share with you something , and particularly this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you look just in the mirror .
the artist gives you a portrait of what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re not familiar with this piece of work .
and then the awkward feeling disappears , it doesn &apos;t look at it at all , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can actually use the lie as a great invention to use our <unk> .
and not just in the arts , even in the <unk> of the mythology , in the mythology , in stories .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at the mirror every morning , and who asked him who is most beautiful in the country ?
and one day , this mirror mirrors , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility out of this true thing , even the mirrors can &apos;t lie out of this thing , from this true thing .
but we should be familiar with that , you know , you can &apos;t tell a woman there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here it is necessary , what we &apos;re going to understand in <unk> <unk> again .
we need this lie to be <unk> , which is the delusion we can &apos;t live .
we have not just in the arts , in the <unk> , but also in science such as great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife of <unk> .
they heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of human beings .
that person was supposed to <unk> and , you know , at least a common ancestors there would be between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and said , that &apos;s not true , what charles is there .
the person is supposed to be by the monkeys or a common ancestors .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to stop that people will get knowledge .
why don &apos;t we need to prevent people from something , if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without those <unk> .
because we &apos;re <unk> , this feeling of being great , <unk> from the highest creatures , not by one of such <unk> as a organism that exists to be a stone , comparable to the things that exists to us .
so , we don &apos;t have these things .
we need to prevent people from things , especially , especially when they &apos;re true .
so , how slowly you see how slowly this mechanism , and how to look at the tracks that he &apos;s leaving to do something different than this beautiful picture of ourselves , i want to share with you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife has told me .
she came from one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a 16-year-old student .
she likes to like him , because he &apos;s a tendency to communicate .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m the firemen .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you know , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> at this point , there &apos;s something wrong .
i &apos;ve been told by my wife , always , if a person in a moral patch , because we &apos;re using it , we should try to replace it through the mri system .
do you take this one and then experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the biology .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in <unk> .
the interest is for <unk> .
but there &apos;s no <unk> that we can look around , where you &apos;re learning how to fire .
there &apos;s just the second second , the firemen .
here he was signed .
and <unk> , you know , his teacher &apos;s teacher doesn &apos;t , you know , you &apos;d like to get rid of the fire , and you &apos;re excited when the fire came after .
no , it just looks much better , if we show that we &apos;re involved in order to eliminate the risks that they &apos;re going to do with fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these <unk> that have been known that in the <unk> of the <unk> , that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he &apos;s not saying it &apos;s not loud .
so here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious of the unconscious , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know is that they can look very different , so they can sound much better for them and others .
so then we &apos;re just making these words that we &apos;re talking about in the language of the political speech .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
but we know , when we tell the word , the social views are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to tell you what we found in my institute .
according to what &apos;s wrong , these <unk> , the willingness , a different reality , a different reality of what we actually know in the unconscious , is to spread out the outside .
so , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of them value , very few of them , very few .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so a little bit of an entertaining , say about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not <unk> by <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people who are feeling secure , they have a soul , or you can also tell you the belief that they &apos;ve been gestated by the soul to life , then they think that &apos;s what the soul would be like , no matter of meat , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and by this soul , you think it &apos;s kind of nature in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> it in latin , who is in latin america .
and if that <unk> then goes through the people , then he &apos;s filled with it , he &apos;s filled with the spirit , with nature , with nature , just with soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so you want to get from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that &apos;s really going to be present to our lives .
and if you look at these <unk> , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing happiness through a lie through a lie world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> , you know from school .
so this is a <unk> , which is a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
namely , to lie that they can just be able to do this logic .
in this case , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was in baltimore here .
a third sentence that immediately shows people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
saying , who doesn &apos;t have a soul that is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and you can feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
the first set of sentences that are logical .
i can say anything .
the logic doesn &apos;t talk about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the analytics don &apos;t say about what is true .
i can say anything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s going to be .
so when <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , when he was right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are obvious correct .
and now our <unk> awareness immediately immediately you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and this is what &apos;s the opposite of the first sentence and <unk> .
because in fact , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with that logic , it &apos;s simply using two sentences to be correct , and a third <unk> that looks like it as if he could do something to do with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we pretend it &apos;s not impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue to keep these things on different examples .
in the present time , we have a very modern example , which is all over again .
this is about another <unk> issue , a <unk> issue from philosophy to present .
this has to do that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who called johannes <unk> and after that is called <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you put it right in the middle of the middle , it &apos;s <unk> , then it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what was going to go first .
so he stands right in the middle .
this is what the <unk> introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so only if you take another example , if you immediately make a big score , it doesn &apos;t need any sense , and it doesn &apos;t need anything .
automatically runs the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of driven into nature , <unk> , by the larger pile that you &apos;re wearing right now , then you get the feeling , you know , you have to feel like a free will .
and if we &apos;re here in <unk> , we &apos;re at the <unk> , then i remember the <unk> for brain brain .
there is a scholars who is called &quot; wolf <unk> , &quot; and he said , &quot; sometimes , <unk> <unk> claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now , we can make the second one sentence again and say , if the wolf <unk> right , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re now able to read almost daily in the day is that they &apos;re in this third sentence .
this looks like this , who doesn &apos;t know who &apos;s not going to be <unk> for its actions and claims to responsibility , and he &apos;s going to be <unk> .
again , they have again .
in fact , you have to prove you to prove whether there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of first was wrong , when you need to take the opposite without evidence of evidence .
and now they can just want to do anything if you want to test anything , if you want to test anything , and most importantly , if you want to make people happy .
so for instance , for instance , if you look for a human being able to tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and i don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , who is called the prophets .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little political <unk> .
tell , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;re going to have one , for the course of these , you know , you can &apos;t prove it .
and you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re concerned with it , you don &apos;t want to prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is quite happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he was <unk> .
because he has led it to a <unk> period at which he doesn &apos;t care .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in this need to prove himself to prove himself to prove that there &apos;s a <unk> .
so , in the way , in the way , the shift in the <unk> is the brilliance of the lie .
and once again , once you have an opportunity to feel these <unk> in other people , doing it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember them .
thank you very much for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed to ask myself , i asked myself to mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and i wondered if i wanted to give you a lecture and give my idea .
i have to be honest , you know , you know , it &apos;s hard to talk about my idea of my idea .
and i may probably imagine my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum all , quite many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two girls who are there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s made for this very bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve been studying engineering engineering , engineering school , engineering college , today , i think , you know , <unk> .
and this is the <unk> for berlin , for berlin <unk> , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they were all <unk> at the time , the <unk> was called <unk> .
the hot <unk> today .
because a good engineer has made a great car or <unk> .
but something <unk> like the n of <unk> , made out of that sort of a hundred watts of a watt that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful to <unk> that he &apos;s a word again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> years .
there was just so that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you knew evil .
the point of the <unk> , but that was meant <unk> and the wind and the solar system , and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what was said to me is , i &apos;m very , because many , many beautiful statements that i have lived through .
i &apos;ve been working in the <unk> , and i was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one was said , the <unk> was the <unk> , which has been a complete <unk> for 10 years , if i have a really hard <unk> of my father , because all colleagues of my father &apos;s <unk> , because all of my colleagues of my father always <unk> him .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was very , very , very , very <unk> , and then you go into a big phase in the <unk> where i asked a picture of a thousand , a thousand <unk> , a thousand <unk> , which was at the time , of course , to be a great <unk> , of course , whether it &apos;s supposed to be great .
and then i went to <unk> <unk> , and then we went with friends , i became <unk> of the company that became <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s largest microfinance <unk> of the world .
a <unk> , but also there we have , of course , again , the problem of a growing enterprise and we got <unk> , a small group , decided that we think , and we think about the next topic of the future , which is , and we think it &apos;s a lot of <unk> that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and i brought you a project that i brought to you now .
and the title of my presentation was , yes , as you go to a hundred percent .
and we just started to wonder with a relatively <unk> story , where we could use a memory of money today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yeah , these are the data .
there &apos;s a thousand and a half thousand people .
they have a renewable view of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> each other , the system begins to fail .
and i &apos;m always telling you the politicians , if you &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
so they always say why ?
we &apos;ve heard about 20 percent in germany .
but there &apos;s no problem .
but right now , we don &apos;t have seven percent and our grid is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent of europe , we have already had the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was simple , the first thing was <unk> , the first contacts with the island , and not just the one .
as big as big , because in fact , as a battery , you have to be a battery in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to continue a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year is about a hundred <unk> electrical performance on <unk> <unk> in the world .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with us , because you don &apos;t need a permit .
that &apos;s pretty fast .
you put that a little box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run of three , three and two will always be waiting .
yeah , so this is a burden on the bottom .
we also have very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system , which is just in small amounts of <unk> .
our goal was simply to say , okay .
the harvest is <unk> and the wind , the sun uses the burden that you can map the wider percentage .
and if you want to go through 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year per year , not the power at the moment , they need to turn the sands off .
that is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can be able to take the entire web .
and of course , they can only be <unk> by any way in some way .
this is no one in the world .
so there &apos;s a little bit of scale , so you can use your car on your <unk> to a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what kind of life do you want to do in <unk> ?
it &apos;s already .
but if you want to <unk> several of these <unk> , and you &apos;re supposed to build a network , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 percent to three percent , and then there &apos;s the rest , the last rest of the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that &apos;s going to be very , very costly , very costly , and it &apos;s not going to work that you do it .
this is going to be an energy that &apos;s going to be , hydrogen , methane , power , power to gas , you know , that will be .
then you need to go to a <unk> <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what was with a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far comes from ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulation .
and the wind and the sun and the burden of the load and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome to the conventional system that takes a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
is great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if the <unk> five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would be done ?
have <unk> with investors , i looked for new <unk> .
we were just five people to rebuild the society again .
and here &apos;s another picture .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with diesel , and they &apos;re doing a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the island , meaning that we find great .
also , we want to support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and so that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin that we could sort of actually map the electrical <unk> at the scale of one to three altogether .
that means we looked at first to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s dirty from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> is it in the early &apos; 70s , for the bbc , today , has been developing , and then we became <unk> <unk> .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very , very large battery .
you &apos;ve got a solar performance , and it can bring it for six hours to get this power , and that &apos;s the battery that we sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up .
and we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he stands there in the hall , in fact , in fact , the whole dynamic behavior of the web , so in the <unk> , it looks like the <unk> of the web , which is the whole battery that we &apos;re doing the web .
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable in order to represent the <unk> <unk> .
and here you can see all this .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
so here we can see this again again , again , again , again , all the time , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done , since <unk> , the hall was finished , until today , is kind of anything like this to design up to the individual operating system in software to design software .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define as a company that &apos;s only between the subject battery battery and the theme of the web , and everything between them .
now , you need to communicate to the battery , you need to communicate the <unk> , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is about the theme that you &apos;re doing in this island , basically , all the time that we &apos;re going to be able to do , if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion is going to be <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , like that , on the island , we have to have <unk> , for instance , for instance , <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> offers a <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can actually start to integrate <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because it will be the burden .
that is , if you &apos;re a 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can <unk> by the n , you can see the nets , yes , that should be , you know , the proportion of the <unk> , but you will never be able to get rid of memory .
and this is just the message .
so many people come and look at that there &apos;s because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn the sands , you don &apos;t have a little bit more of these spinning mass extinctions that cause a little more dense in the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just a lot of <unk> masses of large <unk> , where the wave is , the wave all around europe is spinning around europe .
we &apos;re looking into this web , you can see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to start a few <unk> <unk> , then a little bit of steam steam , then we &apos;re going up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you <unk> that somewhere , it takes a long time .
the <unk> <unk> is at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable stable .
and in the time , they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that spinning , these cubes , then you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> this big battery , two milliseconds .
there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> there .
and the message is , we &apos;ve got to get rid of these kinds of <unk> , if we &apos;re like , if we &apos;re 20 to 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on .
and then we have to break our <unk> capacity on the net .
<unk> is simple , the power power goes with , to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> at the moment , <unk> away from <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or not , because that &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make the capacity for the capacity to be able to break down the <unk> capacity , break back into the net .
now , there are now also a lot of studies .
and to that purpose , people will always come and look at the people , and look at our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you <unk> a piece of a future .
and many discussions i &apos;ve had over the last six years , like the discussion that i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years , in the last 30 years .
you don &apos;t know , there &apos;s rapture , <unk> , we &apos;ve never been involved .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to get out that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity for <unk> the same capacity for the world .
it &apos;s just going to happen .
there &apos;s so much a lot of <unk> and arguments .
so the nice thing is that i &apos;ve been experienced now in the last two years , that the scientists are put on my side .
we have now gotten over 10 million <unk> , even around the german net now right now to <unk> the german net .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so that &apos;s why you see that there is a change there , and it &apos;s just not from this <unk> to the idea , a hundred percent of renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , i &apos;ve always been trying to do these <unk> , these <unk> , which have a personal web , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
and the question is , it &apos;s very simple , if you &apos;re completely independent , by any way you &apos;re completely independent , or <unk> the somewhere around the world , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;re an island .
and then they &apos;re just going to consume the sun and wind up where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy , and i &apos;m also grateful that they have said that they &apos;re using the sun .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , is the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can take a collective of it , and use a little bit together .
and good , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit of crazy and a vision .
and you really have to stay quite <unk> , but i think that it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , new york , new times the streets of los angeles went to los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who had just two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> paper , it became a book that was <unk> by robert <unk> &apos;s junior <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> <unk> , who was a lifelong career in his <unk> .
nathaniel left at juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend reading all of you reading book , or to watch the movie , so it &apos;s not just the wonderful connectedness that came between those of these two men , but how the music helped make that connection , and how the music is allowed to make it .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 two years ago , two years ago , at walt disney .
he was just a reflection of beethoven &apos;s first first ever symphony , and i came across the stage to imagine .
he was talking in a very <unk> and <unk> note about yo-yo ma and chairman clinton and how the dodgers would never get into the baseball world , and that &apos;s all the <unk> onstage in the last sentence of <unk> .
we went to talk to music music , and a few days later , i got an e-mail email in which i was interested in nathaniel care for me .
so i have to mention that nathaniel had a medical treatment , because it was already treated with electricity and with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that &apos;s tracked his entire life .
now , as a consequence , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable for these schizophrenic periods , and these are sometimes so bad , and then he passed away , in the streets of <unk> row , always the horror and the <unk> of his own spirit .
and in exactly the way , nathaniel was <unk> when we had the first grade class in the walt disney hall in the walt disney hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked perfectly lost .
he was talking about invisible <unk> and smoke and how somebody wanted to poison in her sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was scared i could lose him that he could lose him in one of his own modes , and that i began to destroy his relationship to the highlight , and i started to relieve him , scale and other exciting forms of <unk> .
so i started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven <unk> .
and while i was playing , i realized that in <unk> eyes had a complete change .
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical reaction , whose was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger in understanding , in a calm curiosity and promises .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and i began to play a few snippets of <unk> <unk> , and i asked them to play them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , starting from bach to beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he &apos;s not only a <unk> knowledge about music , but it also connected her to a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding , which i only know from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by switching music , and he talked about music , he was from this <unk> , confused man who had moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , fine musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing .
in nathaniel , music means music emotional .
because the music allows him to allow him , his thoughts and excitement with help of its imagination and creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that &apos;s the nature of art .
so this is the reason why we make music : so that we are something that we &apos;re in all of us , deep inside of our emotions , our emotions , through our artistic lens .
and the reality of that expression is , all of us , and move , inspired and united .
so what nathaniel did is it took him back to a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his mind that he could recognize his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m going to talk to acute music music , whether it &apos;s disney disney , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i stole the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i have a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two two .
that first , that was more like a romantic kind .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> .
what &apos;s a fish .
even better , he was going to be <unk> in <unk> of sustainability .
so you could be able to feel it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the ceo called the ceo of the company , and i asked if i could give you an event about sustainability .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this sort of thing was supposed to be chefs , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve got the sea distribution as we did forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so i think it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
so many arguments about it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> is needed to get a pound detector .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company that tries to make it right .
i wanted to supported her .
the day before the event , i phoned the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
don &apos;t call it .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just about the facts right , you &apos;re famous for the fact that you &apos;re in the sea to grow out so far out of the sea . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of the fish being distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added up , &quot; we &apos;re basically a different world .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> one , great .
&quot; <unk> &apos;s one what ? what does it do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that evening , i lay in bed , and what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i phoned the next day , right before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said , he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll be .
well , i &apos;m <unk> with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally finally <unk> my senior biologists .
we don &apos;t call it .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what are you ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , gobble and <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in fact , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what &apos;s sustainable to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually <unk> <unk> from this fish , because i swear in god , the fish that drew fish after that conversation after that .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way that you ever know better you learn your fish , you know the fish that you love .
i ate it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about a fish .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright , almost white color .
the chef had it <unk> .
stop twice .
amazingly , he was still <unk> .
who can make a fish so well , after it was <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . actually , it &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t eat the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way you understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they raised <unk> on what was essentially wetlands .
they did this by raising the land .
they built these complicated <unk> of channels , and they <unk> water from the land and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to see what these are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company would bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of the water pump , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a <unk> 60 hectare of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and the <unk> , and his company <unk> the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you haven &apos;t seen anything .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and the density , the <unk> .
i wasn &apos;t quite a long time at a time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles and a part of &quot; a crocodile kissing &quot; . &quot;
okay ? so there we were , and we were pushing through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> down to my knee , and <unk> <unk> .
here he takes a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he looks a pattern of <unk> that reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> is the largest part of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i know nothing about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and fall down in more <unk> of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , in the way that kind of art .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it come , is that your fish ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , which is incredible .
but what food is ?
what is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s continued to tell me that it &apos;s such a wonderful system that the fish would eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the dry biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
and later on the day , i was walking around this site with <unk> around , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; unlike any farm , that i ever had , &quot; how do you do success ? &quot;
at the moment , it was as if a director would have a <unk> .
and we <unk> the corner , and we provided the most incredible sight of sight , thousands and thousands of dylan , a literally <unk> carpet so far .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at her <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t make your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well last year , on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest one , and one of the most important private private europe has become in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t a good <unk> , not the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the <unk> the gut , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s <unk> that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures your success to the health of their hometown .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this is not going to be there in the beginning .
they breed in a city of a city , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they &apos;re flying out there .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line from the <unk> .
seriously .
i had a sort of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , flies fly 240 miles to the farm and fly it back to the evening ?
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was a song of whitney , houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do this because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved story , the <unk> , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like them .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i almost never <unk> .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted <unk> .
she liked sweet and in it as if you take a bite from the sea .
i mentioned this to <unk> and it <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense of being able to enter something inside the body .
she has evolved in evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added up , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her fish -- a farm that affects her success .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that has no <unk> , <unk> it , because the water goes through this farm is flowing from this farm in the stream .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that rivers tend to have , they tend to lead , chemical pollutants , <unk> <unk> .
and if it was fought by the system , and this leaves is the water cleaner , as like it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s driving their success to the health of their hometown , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but for you .
because if the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should do it , because this love , as whatever , is <unk> .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good foods , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
now , what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the foods , in the foods .
but for a lot of people &apos;s kind of radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that these things are the things that the future will tell you , and says , &quot; hey , hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , no , because we &apos;re making enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
a billion people are starving .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
<unk> grain of herbivores , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on earth , chicken in fish , and all the time , the &apos; limitation is , &quot; when we feed more people &apos;s cheaper , how awful can be cheaper ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the easy thing . it was the business plan of america .
we should call them , what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> capital of capital that allows this production .
this is not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s because of <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not by <unk> land , not by <unk> water , not by <unk> water , but through forests , not by <unk> and nets , but by fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital capital , chemistry and machines are sitting in there , and it &apos;s never really done to eat the food .
so let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that the two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
these are the ones that are not the worlds for these businesses , and the ones that involve <unk> , businesses , businesses are growing up , farmers , farmers who are not just <unk> .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s me right , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to share with you today is the whole of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about <unk> , i want you to think about how we can use information so that they can &apos;t be visible .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a certain <unk> of age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter a certain death of death , let &apos;s say accidents .
and instantly , i see another pattern that makes you .
namely , because in the <unk> here , people are the most active and you &apos;re at the <unk> .
we can move one step further and line the data and see that the data and the usual suspects are the usual suspects not for everyone .
now , if we move on , and after age , 40 years , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or we see that accidents are even the key to people .
and who <unk> see that is particularly true in men .
so what you see is that the view of information and data in this way is very much in swim in a living environment .
and if we can do this for data , why not the content for the content itself ?
so what we &apos;re now here is the <unk> of each single , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my office in their <unk> .
with <unk> , you can dive in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this issue and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here , i &apos;m going to show you all the time on the other , armstrong armstrong will be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look anything at the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i go back to step back and <unk> the lens .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , wider , <unk> , <unk> , and then you &apos;re not looking at it or not just <unk> .
you do something that is a little different .
it &apos;s something between them and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> and <unk> them on a little summary .
so the summary of all this is a short picture and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just show the top 500 of the <unk> .
but even in this guise , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we &apos;re going to get an idea about the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the word &quot; government . &quot;
now , after i &apos;ve chosen the government &apos; government , i know that the <unk> of the people are at the time of the year .
this is really important , because this is an insight that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you take one step back and look at it .
looking at a certain of these summaries , i can go back into the theme of time , &quot; people of the year &quot; people go in .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are <unk> . some people come from science . some , even less , come out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s bono &apos;s winner winner .
so we can jump back and take a look at all ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re browsing on the web , the first time it &apos;s really a web , not just to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else would show up .
i just show you the new york times website .
<unk> , these app -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see websites at all , every single website like this .
so i can step back one step , and right to a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you just look at web websites in this way , all the way to look at the same way in the same way .
so i can zoom in my course in a certain time .
so here is the whole demonstration of the whole demonstration that i kept here .
and i can sort of see anything i &apos;ve seen before , again , again .
and , if i take a step up , i &apos;m going to look at everything , i can <unk> my philosophy , maybe after my <unk> , maybe i &apos;m looking for <unk> , or here , i &apos;m looking for <unk> , right now , right ?
and from here , i can go to the side and you go back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it &apos;s going to make the big picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the fort curse .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going to go from one another to the other , start to make a lot of things , and detect patterns that were otherwise hidden hidden ?
if we can do this , then this is going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just move into information , we can understand knowledge .
and if we experience knowledge , then we can even <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school at school every day an hour per day .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my thought of other worlds in other worlds , and in my <unk> way deep in me , my deep curiosity <unk> .
and these curiosity also showed me that when i was not in school , through the forests of forests , walked and <unk> , frogs , frogs and <unk> and <unk> , all the home and the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible explore .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be mirror in my environment , because back in the late 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals that showed us animals and places of a world that showed us before .
well , this is good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video video games yet , these <unk> film still gave the whole imagery into the media environment , i had to create the images in my head .
so we had to put that all together . when we read a book of a book , we took the description of the <unk> and put them on the screen on our heads .
my reaction was drawing and painting by aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all kinds of things .
i was constantly <unk> by the teacher &apos;s constantly getting caught by the teacher , hidden textbook , <unk> .
creativity had to come out .
and something interesting happened . what happened to me about jacques <unk> shows was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our planet .
surely , i would never be an alien world to achieve a spaceship that seemed very unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually walk in , here on earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic like all that i &apos;ve ever imagined when i had this books .
so i decided when i was 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a little village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t give them <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , found , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> <unk> in a pool of <unk> in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face the face two years later when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 1,000 hours under water , 500 hours of it .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is so rich in <unk> life , how we really can &apos;t imagine it .
the idea of nature doesn &apos;t know frontiers , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love to the ocean , with the same intensity , it &apos;s the same intensity .
when i became an adult profession , it was the filmmaking .
it seemed the best way to tell you , to tell you , to tell stories , to create images with my need .
as a kid , i drew comic books and so .
so , movies of the way were the way to bring images and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories that i call myself <unk> from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; i could , &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could connect my <unk> for the <unk> .
so basically my two passions .
something interesting happened at &quot; <unk> , &quot; to solve a problem in this film -- and that we had to create a sort of liquid <unk> in this film -- exploding on <unk> animation , <unk> .
what came out was the first <unk> <unk> ever to see in a film .
so the film doesn &apos;t make any money , right , just played his costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience all around the world was like <unk> and <unk> .
according to arthur arthur clarke , you know , <unk> technology and magic no longer .
so you saw something magic .
and i found that tremendously exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this has got to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even more on .
together with <unk> <unk> , we made the guy out of liquid metal . the success depended on it , like this effect .
and it worked . again , we had created something , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money on the audience .
from these two experiences , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend of mine , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . it was called digital <unk> .
so the basic idea of this company was it , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , etc .
so that &apos;s what we did , and we did an opportunity for a while .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- what we did was actually created the company -- too slow .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; the avatar , the <unk> effects of visual effects and <unk> effects in new altitudes , with the <unk> human , <unk> characters that were supposed to be <unk> .
but the bar pushed very nice , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted that , and i made these other film about the big ship that goes .
that &apos;s what i used to sell as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became a <unk> <unk> of magnitude , a passionate film .
but secretly , i wanted to <unk> the real estate .
so i made this film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i persuaded them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re diving to the wreckage . we &apos;re film the real estate .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is immensely important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to it again , that &apos;s your own imagination .
we actually created a reality six months later , in which i <unk> myself in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles underneath the north atlantic , and i looked at the actual titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that &apos;s really blown me .
and it &apos;s a huge amount of interest , and we had to make cameras and <unk> <unk> and all sorts of things .
and i noticed how much these <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;re going to go up into this capsule , and you &apos;re in this dark , <unk> environment , where you can &apos;t make hope , if you don &apos;t make it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s exactly like i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was very obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , that &apos;s what part of curiosity and science has been . it was all . it was curiosity , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to imagine a character that was able to design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the world .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i haven &apos;t seen before , sometimes , sometimes no one had ever seen before the science at the time when we saw them .
so this is really <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i met an unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on the ice for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we looked at the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and we explored with <unk> .
we went back to the wreckage for the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , the <unk> <unk> .
our purpose was , <unk> , and to watch the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the <unk> , and you didn &apos;t have any means , so we developed the technology .
so , i &apos;m sitting there , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that these <unk> looks quite like , and i know that once the band is played there .
and i &apos;ll fly a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m actually <unk> , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;m going to be physically physically within the invasion of the titanic .
and that was the <unk> shape of a <unk> <unk> that i &apos;ve ever had , because before i take a <unk> , i always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i had gone through the film .
and the set was a precise copy of the design of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize this <unk> , that you use such <unk> <unk> , and your own consciousness into the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little glimpse of what might happen in some decades , if you &apos;ve got <unk> , to explore something to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> , which i can imagine as a <unk> .
after this expeditions , we started looking at what we saw there was really value , for example , for example , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . that &apos;s just aliens aliens , but on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in one of the way we do it .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees celsius that they can survive .
at the same time , i was interested in the same time for <unk> , which was my childhood <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they sit in the <unk> and the right <unk> , and they &apos;re going to <unk> right , go through russia , through the mission , through the mission of the mission , all the <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of the end , it was that i took a <unk> with us in the deep sea .
and i took them to the world and <unk> them around the world , at the bottom , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of the sources , so they could probe the way around and so on .
now , we did all sorts of things , but actually , in fact , science is actually said , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , then as a kid , and the implementation in the reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m going to think i &apos;m going to have to be a director of the director , a leader will be a leader like a <unk> or so .
but i didn &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
these <unk> movies give us no money .
we &apos;re just going to play the cost . and of course , there &apos;s no trace .
everyone thinks i &apos;m between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; <unk> and have made me a little <unk> on one towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these books , for a very small audience .
no credit , no credit , no money . what do you do ?
you are doing it around the problem to the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment that gives you . you &apos;re doing it because of the <unk> connection , and because of the weird connection that comes together when a small group of people forming a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people that worked on for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have to be aware of each other is because you &apos;ve overcome a problem that you can &apos;t explain .
if you go back to shore , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the difficulty of the world , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other technique , &quot; you can &apos;t just explain it to the other . &quot;
there &apos;s a connection , a respectful respect .
so when i came back to my next film , &quot; avatar &apos;s &quot; avatar , trying to use the same kind of leadership , which is that you were respected , respected .
it &apos;s really transformative .
so , i stood again with a little team on <unk> terrain , and we were called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist yet .
terribly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we have been a <unk> for a hundred and a half years .
so , in effect , my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who thought we had these <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed the outcome .
so what can we do all of the end ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think that first is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can create a reality .
and the idea of your teams is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me get young filmmaker saying , &quot; give me a advice to me how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s the other thing for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t do it yourself , not for yourself . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art , in the arts and research has to be an alternative , because there will be a <unk> .
no major effort , the innovation demanded , the innovation demanded .
you need to be ready to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way , and failure is an alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this is surprising to me , because my <unk> <unk> in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seed , to make the things that we need to make and deliver the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people , actually , even more important than anyone on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow a lot of years . it &apos;s too much rain , but things are going to change the way that it can &apos;t withstand their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , a climate change is terrible for you .
secondly , the <unk> for them very important .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of one thing , the <unk> would be energy by the most effective .
well , the <unk> is <unk> over time .
in fact , the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> was the industrial revolution in the twentieth century , and even in the twentieth century , there &apos;s a <unk> case in the <unk> , and therefore we can make modern materials , and so many things are going to do .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- let &apos;s take a new barrier , and this barrier is based on co2 .
co2 warms up the planets and the equation for co2 is quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and that <unk> some very negative effects , effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the <unk> follow that natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the natural world .
well , the exact relationship between a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are , there are some people , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certain ambiguity that are going to follow these things , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we really need to go down to close to zero zero ?
isn &apos;t you enough about half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero zero , the temperature will continue .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different as to say , we &apos;ve got a <unk> foot high truck that has to come under a three square foot bridge , and it can take it back to it .
it &apos;s got to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re running a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons of tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five metric tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to make change that lower down to zero .
it &apos;s a constant time .
and just different economic changes , it affects at all , and we need to get to reduce the <unk> increase and to zero <unk> .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a bit of a multiplication left -- and you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s the number of people who depend on the number of people who are using the number of people on the service , which is the equivalent of a <unk> unit .
so let &apos;s look at each factor of a factor , and we think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of those numbers has to be very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it &apos;s going to spend on 9 billion to move on to nine billion .
if we really successfully succeed with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this includes all the foods that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things and behavioral <unk> , these services to make all of everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the wealthy world , in the upper world , we could be able to make <unk> and less use , but in average , that number one year is going to rise every year , and so much more than doubles the number of services per year .
here &apos;s a very basic service . there &apos;s a very basic service , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the e , it &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
because of course , different successes of the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there are a lot of services to reduce some individual services in 90 percent .
in other service , like <unk> <unk> , kiribati , <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> or <unk> : <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement .
overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might be able to get a factor of a factor of three or maybe one factor .
but the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to <unk> 13 billion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is what &apos;s going to be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going on per unit of energy .
it turns out the question is , if you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every <unk> of electricity are co2 , except renewables and renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , i &apos;m not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there is no time you have a miracle to a miracle to a particular date .
usually you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some of them not .
but in this case , we need to be <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered how can i really get this out ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that inspires the idea of people here ?
i remember last year when i gave mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is one .
i decided that it was going to be <unk> my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so there are some natural fireflies fireflies are .
i mean , you know , you didn &apos;t bite them . in fact , in fact , they &apos;re not going to take the glass of glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> like this , but they all don &apos;t do much .
we need solutions , either one or several of them have a range of scale and have a whole range of bandwidth , and although there are a lot of ways that people are looking for , i &apos;m actually seeing five , which can afford these big .
i have the tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
and this may be a <unk> contribution , and if you do better , that would be nice , but my message here is that we need to work on all of those five work , and we can &apos;t give them up , because they &apos;re scary problems .
so let &apos;s look at the first burning fossil fuels , <unk> from either coal or natural gas .
what you need to do is , maybe easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all the co2 that &apos;s going to come from the burning of the <unk> , capture under pressure , and then , you know , it remains .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> that creates 60 percent -- 80 percent of the time , but it &apos;s going to be very hard to get a 100 percent , and they resist an agreement for the ingredient of the co2 , is a big challenge .
who &apos;s going to make sure ?
who can make a difference , which is literally more than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a hard thing .
next : <unk> .
it &apos;s also three big problems . the costs , particularly in <unk> countries are high . the question of security , you really feel that nothing can &apos;t go wrong , despite the human fulfillment that &apos;s not being used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s where you should work .
the last three of five , i put in .
it &apos;s renewable energy as they &apos;re often called .
and also , although it &apos;s great -- they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is the energy density that these technologies are dramatically smaller than <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 more land than a normal plant station .
and also <unk> <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , and it doesn &apos;t seem like the wind , and the wind doesn &apos;t always see the flow of the wind .
so , if you have to rely on these sources of sources , you have to have a way of getting energy in times when they &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission of transmission . if we say , the power source is because the power of the country is , they don &apos;t just need the technology to deal with the risk of it .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries , looking for : the cars , computers , mobile phone , cell phones , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy that the world is using the world .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 times better than the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to do these <unk> sources , we &apos;re 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the world .
if you want to rely on 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
now where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how are we going to target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five spaces we need at least 100 people .
so you &apos;re going to be saying , you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of us here in the ted group that are already engaged .
now , bill &apos;s big have thousands of companies , including one called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> investment in dozens of companies making great things and interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold , and i fund a company that &apos;s a company , maybe surprisingly , <unk> .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
so the development has stopped in this industry , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
so the <unk> means that , instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had thought about it for long , but you could never be able to simulate it , but there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , you can simulate it , and you see , yeah , right ?
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of current reactors as a <unk> .
instead of breaking the head , they burn it . a great thing .
and the uranium &apos;s being used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a column , often than &quot; the invasion wave . &quot;
this is actually the <unk> .
here is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , which is 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s burned to be burned , so it &apos;s <unk> uranium .
this is the <unk> u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> <unk> &apos;s cheap and easy , you get enough propellant on the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the destination that we need to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot of a 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are being created in the poor countries , and still something agriculture , and hopefully it &apos;s going to clean and cement it to be clean .
so to reach this 80 percent , the countries , including countries , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other note is , whether we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s been used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a key feature .
if we go back from there , what should we be looking at ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to bring up to the way , the less we <unk> , the less <unk> , the <unk> will be smaller and the temperature .
but actually , this note is the kind of thing that we do not fully <unk> the big <unk> , just right , or even something less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
this is the world we need to track <unk> , and we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this subject .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; the <unk> energy system . &quot;
they &apos;re actually going to really go through and create a framework that can be present , because we need to support assistance from all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
this is a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , you could choose the president , or i could choose , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , that &apos;s going to be <unk> between the long time in the time , in the way in <unk> people , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all the lives of this 2 billion will be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use for more research research .
when countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the fact that they &apos;re just supposed to be spent on these kinds of innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; local <unk> &amp; amp ; trade <unk> .
we need to spread the news .
we need to lead dialogue and full of the things that will be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just in order to understand more <unk> -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : in order to perform the simulation of a supercomputer , all of the big scientists we &apos;ve done , we just need to have a few 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s going to work .
so the hard step is that the first project is building the first <unk> , to find another billion , the place that actually build the first one of them .
once the first finished is , if he &apos;s promised this as i promised , you know , it &apos;s all clear , because the profit , energy is so different than in <unk> , as we know them .
to understand the right , that means deep in the ground , is almost like a vertical column <unk> nuclear <unk> , and then it &apos;s <unk> , and then the process starts up and it &apos;s going up to the bottom ?
<unk> : right . so , today , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of control that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and do things like that .
but if you have a lot of cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of a column that you bury , without the whole intricacy .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished .
a <unk> , which offers a solution to the junk .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens with the crap : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with this method -- then you take it into the next reactor and burn it into the next reactor and burn it .
and we &apos;re starting to take away by the trash , which is already exists in these <unk> or <unk> . this is our <unk> .
so what &apos;s a problem for these reactors , which is what we put in our interactions , and this is what &apos;s going to reduce dramatically in the process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people in this world , you &apos;ve talked about these options .
where is the greatest interest , so what really does ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t determined a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company in russia , india -- i was here , and i &apos;ve met the <unk> of the company .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have got something .
this is an alternative one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this built , so everyone &apos;s built a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , time , time and likely to make something really ?
<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent 20 years .
this is kind of the time that we have to think of the <unk> that we need to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , when everything is fine , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could hold it easy .
and fortunately , this is dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of thousands of companies , and we need hundreds , as they work , they can work harder for their pilots to <unk> .
and it would be best if it could create multiple , because then you could use a blend .
so every case we need a solution .
according to the big possible breakthroughs , is this the greatest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would be without the <unk> , but it &apos;s much more important .
in the nuclear sector sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems a little bit hard , but maybe we &apos;re telling that .
and so , there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a <unk> is a million times so much energy like one , say , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s what the radiation is , the <unk> and the cost of the matter , is the power of the land and other things .
if that doesn &apos;t happen , what happens ?
do we need to use <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come into that situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and a heart attack stands for a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which deals with various techniques to <unk> the warming , so that 20 or 30 years for us to get <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t just work at insurance , because one might be lazy , so you keep eating , because you know , you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re concerned with the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you should have it , if you &apos;re going to have the things faster , or this innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences to convince you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different camps .
those scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there is negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are shifting ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell you about that there are a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is as much as aids .
you make the mistake , and you pay it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems that you have to invest in something that has done -- and that &apos;s what the investment is , and what comes out of the investment is not so clear , in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst , and they say , well , this is not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us care .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skeptics were going to say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s not a co2 <unk> , i wish that it was that it was not the co2 , but i think it &apos;s cheaper than the previous way . &quot;
and that would be the answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you use all of those time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals of suffering and so on , that &apos;s a <unk> waste of resource to invest in , while there &apos;s a <unk> waste of resource .
<unk> : well , the actual amount of research on research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- it &apos;s not so dramatic .
they don &apos;t suffer from those other things .
and then you get too big <unk> , and there can be sensible people disagree , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to finance that .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short , and funded the learning learning , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much more powerful .
if you get <unk> , you &apos;re very high <unk> , then you can just keep the wealthy .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times so much for our energy working without changing .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about .
now his new <unk> is : &quot; why don &apos;t we have a research ? &quot;
and he &apos;s still becoming , because of his former stories , with the <unk> <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s going to bring it back now .
and this is a school i think for appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it will be supported .
now , bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> is a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . you need to have a big <unk> structure of structure with 20 bags , about a foot tape , about a foot tape , and build a gold .
the marshmallow has got on it .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually very hard because it &apos;s very hard for collaborating to work .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> <unk> .
it was a great success .
since i was done , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops in the world , with students , designers , and architects , even with the challenge of <unk> , and there &apos;s something to share with you with them .
normally , most people are starting to orient themselves with the task .
they talk about it , you think , what &apos;s going to look like , they &apos;re <unk> around .
then you spend a little bit of planning in planning and organization . they abstract spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> constantly <unk> .
and finally , just before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it gently back up to the top , step back and <unk> .
but then , almost always , what happens is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the tomato sauce is that the whole thing will bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more <unk> <unk> than others , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and produce <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more <unk> , and under the best they are <unk> , and they are <unk> <unk> .
and this is quite astonishing .
as peter didn &apos;t tell us , they &apos;re not just the tallest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how does that ? why ? what ?
and peter said , &quot; neither of the kids spend time to be boss the words of words . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that <unk> was trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow up on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
so what &apos;s different is that they &apos;re starting to start doing the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have access to <unk> prototypes .
<unk> is this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each other trial , the kids get immediate feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is , working with prototypes , considerably -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average average for most of us is about <unk> , which is half of them , lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
three feet is the highest .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are key to build stable structures .
ceos lie on average . but here &apos;s interesting .
if you put an <unk> administrator at the team , they &apos;re going to make significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , you can see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special attributes of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and this team , the <unk> and the work will look at the work of the team of making significant money .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical approach , you get about six , you get the stable structures .
i was trying to do something .
i thought , let &apos;s take the <unk> .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for the winner for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had done a <unk> high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> have a powerful effect ?
we went through this exercise with the same students .
what do you think ?
now they understand the advantage of the scale .
so it was made of the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction at the time .
so , there are so <unk> lessons for us about nature and success .
so you might wonder , why would anyone actually invest in a <unk> <unk> ?
the reason is , i &apos;m using digital tools and creating processes to help teams to help autos , cars , video games and <unk> .
and what the <unk> is , they &apos;re helping to identify the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language or an ethos to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested , they can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples from all around the world how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and that we &apos;re using as much as our feelings and our emotions , and we do that in the challenge that we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a small prototype of that experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to bring a <unk> .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s pretend we had a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and this is a machine machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve asked my friends at last time , and they wanted to go all the time .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america addiction &quot; . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re drawn to the <unk> , <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to have the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an <unk> .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back to this planet , you go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that existed on the planet , regardless of what scale them : health , wealth , wealth , opportunities , seasonal <unk> .
there was never before a time .
my <unk> died all the time they were 60 .
i mean , my grandparents are <unk> .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so i should be better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born in new delhi is expected to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox got more people on this planet .
they engineered the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we <unk> them . pop .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us , the millions of us are still threatened by one generation .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of science .
and from my view of view , the scientific method is to try to see things , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the great achievements of humankind .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on the world every day to bed hungry every day .
and that number goes up , and it &apos;s very quick , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not just that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , they &apos;re disappearing , and if we didn &apos;t go out of that mess , and if we don &apos;t go out of that mess we disappear .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that &apos;s going to feed billions of people without the land that they live to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t even destroyed .
i think this really , and no , this is not <unk> .
but that keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that you &apos;re awake at night . we never need scientific progress yet as well as now , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it <unk> , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the threshold of incredible events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back to this , 300 years ago , to find a time that we &apos;ve fought progress in which we have fought progress in which we have gotten more <unk> .
people are putting themselves in their belief , and that &apos;s so tightly you can &apos;t free it .
not even the truth gets it .
and listen , everyone has a very quite focused on his opinion ; even a right on his opinion .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to your own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i needed a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an essay on &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at the resistance of the resistance , to the resistance of what &apos;s most effective in the end of the public health in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what i was supposed to do , so i was just doing what i was doing , i wrote an article and continued .
and soon , i wrote an essay on genetically altered food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were mad .
so i wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules on a particular instead rather than a random kind of <unk> into nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the paper , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to go , we eat food , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me care , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found out .
and that &apos;s because these undergraduates that were crazy to me didn &apos;t know .
these were <unk> people , intellectual people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and i got that mess ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress like earlier .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
we &apos;re talking ironic about little quote that we quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reason , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of losing , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call some name and understand people .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , nuclear weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought they were always right . be skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand .
don &apos;t take anything .
but it &apos;s : if you get the evidence you need to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can tell the reason that we live in an epidemic of fear , as i haven &apos;t seen it , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was released , a terrible story , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
many studies have been done to see if that was true .
clinical trials should be done ; that &apos;s a serious matter .
the data came in .
the data coming in in the u.s. , from england , sweden made from sweden , and they were all right , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see is what makes us feel we really feel .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of a <unk> of a <unk> that &apos;s data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating .
<unk> because the u.s. usa is one of the only countries in the world , where the <unk> are falling down .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do this .
because anybody else has t.b. ?
has an one one in the audience who ever see somebody die ?
don &apos;t happen very often .
it doesn &apos;t happen at all , but monday , but monday , over the last year .
these are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because this isn &apos;t what happened here , we can &apos;t be able to do it , and people like jenny <unk> can be around and the messages of fear and illiteracy like tv and larry king live .
and they can do that because they can &apos;t connect the cause .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst human human race .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just created a <unk> <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , apart from paul <unk> and vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people are valuable to <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he is like .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul <unk> in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell <unk> <unk> .
he gets phone calls at home because people want to tell him , they know where his kids are going to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , you know , go back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and it &apos;s just happening .
we are now measles .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just immunized .
what about <unk> ? take that . why not ?
and a <unk> of me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i think i &apos;m a little <unk> .
nobody ever mentioned before .
she would not vaccinate their child <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no bookings in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe in lagos , if you look at a airplane in lagos , and you &apos;re just going to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he &apos;s coming to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a disfiguring disease , and we don &apos;t know , because the world works now .
this is the planet that we &apos;re living in . don &apos;t do it as if he doesn &apos;t .
we love to cover ourselves . we love that .
do you take all your vitamins tomorrow morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , which helps you hang on .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data bias keeps the time .
they make their urine . they &apos;re doing almost more .
that &apos;s okay , you know , <unk> billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark <unk> . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the medical industry .
we hate a really strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us who can afford it .
so we run away , and where are we running ?
we run into the arms of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious matter because it &apos;s crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little barbs here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , <unk> , because i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions dollars of it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that people scream and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some <unk> , who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where do you think and the magic evidence of how to replace science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than <unk> drugs that we know that they can &apos;t stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any other person of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have . they always have . they always have .
well , the <unk> epidemic , where we &apos;re right now is this ridiculous battle between the <unk> <unk> foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch of every branch , every <unk> , has changed from the people .
you know , there was no paradise paradise in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of it doesn &apos;t work and some of it .
we &apos;ve got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now , we can make it more precisely , and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like <unk> a <unk> , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want it ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we dismiss organic food .
why do we do that ?
well , what i &apos;m hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want a huge fields that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s pretty , morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re scared of a <unk> , and it holds millions of people from flourishing .
you know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . sorry .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically transformed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s like a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this one .
and then people could eat the food and won &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and everything i can tell is why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes , genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , and our absolute foods , better food , is unique food .
this isn &apos;t about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do so far as far as we do , we don &apos;t believe , not to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; are you still going to be in this ridiculous time , and going into the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to . i want to go .
in the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want them to <unk> them , and we will move them where we want .
we need to think of these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time , we &apos;re going to be glad to be happy , and we &apos;re going to be happy to do that .
i know that we can , and as far as it affects me , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may seem weird to be interested in this a magician , it &apos;s because they look like a delusion that &apos;s going to be true , if you &apos;re not true enough to believe enough . &quot;
in other studies , <unk> , <unk> have shown a measurable effect , the <unk> , and it &apos;s only because the person thinks what happens to her , whether it &apos;s only not true enough to believe , a measurable effect in the body called a measurable effect .
a delusion is going to be real because somebody knows it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in every childhood care for children .
i myself took him from the <unk> <unk> magic <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and you &apos;ll explain him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
so you see what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , my hand that you can study .
i will just keep the knife in my own .
i bring my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of it , i &apos;m just going to <unk> my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that nobody &apos;s going to move on anything , and as long as i <unk> here , nothing can go into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes fine , the knife will be held by my bare physical <unk> .
it &apos;s in the place of his place that i can shake it , i can shake it without knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , not <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often <unk> young children , because you can start to learn a lot about deception , if you look closer , although it &apos;s a very simple light trick .
probably , many of you are familiar with this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i <unk> my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that there &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
now , in the moment , where i <unk> my hand of you , so you move them from the back , the fingers here , my <unk> , just where he was , in a position where he &apos;s been <unk> .
a great trick ?
there &apos;s someone who &apos;s sitting there no childhoods .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a delusion , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers to see : because the mind and the way that it &apos;s information , they &apos;re not just going to count , one , two , three , but they &apos;re as a group .
but it &apos;s actually not all about this . and then i open my hand .
now , of course it would be held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , by my favorite <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , it &apos;s the same thing that i &apos;m <unk> , by moving through this motion , that the fingers are hidden away .
i take this hand away . and here is the knife .
this trick is able to show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
one year or so , i read a study that was really blown me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing .
it &apos;s what it &apos;s like , if you put a pair of placebo in a white pill , in the shape of a tennis ball , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , that &apos;s just a <unk> , white pill that has a <unk> effect .
but if you &apos;re the shape of the shape that you give them to do these <unk> , for example , in a smaller pill , and the blue colors and the movie is actually measurably more efficient .
and that , although not any of these <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really made me crazy .
but it turns out that this is not all that .
if you take a plug , you &apos;re still more powerful than an <unk> .
a colored capsule which is in the end of yellow , and the other red is better than a white capsule .
you also have a role dose .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact best statistic . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... also , the <unk> play .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want the ultimate <unk> , you need to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected to a patient .
this is a very powerful image in mind . that &apos;s much more powerful than one white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a <unk> .
so the fact is that the white pill don &apos;t appear as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t appear as well as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
and none of it has any really interesting property . it &apos;s just our belief that we &apos;ve made a stronger impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic magic .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a delusion , and let &apos;s make it look real .
so we know that we need to reach out to be able to reach the needle if it &apos;s supposed to be .
this is a 18 inches long . it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;ll do it first a little bit of <unk> .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special meat meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and through them , through the other side , to the other side .
if you &apos;re <unk> , if you drop lightly , i &apos;ve demonstrated this a couple of friends last night in the room room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman accident .
so i &apos;m going to propose if you &apos;re going to evil evil , you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , what i &apos;m going to do is , i &apos;m going to make the very first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same way , you can also <unk> , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom section of my head , i &apos;m just going to make a little excursion .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it crazy ?
and just a little bit of a little bit through my skin and on the other side of the time .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
approximately .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> himself for the skin , just to talk a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back saying , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen it . &quot;
people in the <unk> come in .
let me show you from the closeness .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect .
that &apos;s my meat meat , and i can .
i &apos;m sorry . if you knock evil , look , you don &apos;t look at it .
the people on the back of the back or the one that &apos;s going to see later on video , will say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it was real , there &apos;s a hole and there would be a hole , if it was really real . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
normally i would take the needle out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this framework , and with the purpose of a delusion , i &apos;m going to make a needle , i will just leave the needle there and go on the stage .
we &apos;re going to face a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re excited . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people to count the number of books that were released with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they were released after about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s very much <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these bonds of work , there are several cognitive falling that it &apos;s kind of almost impossible to think of happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive ones .
this is true for <unk> , which is to think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think that we &apos;re not as <unk> as any other .
the first one of these traps is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out the word happiness is not a useful word anymore because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could possibly do it , but in large , and all the things that we need to give up , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is an assertion of experience and memory : basically , you know , it &apos;s about happiness in his life and happy his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we &apos;re not thinking about a fact that we can think about a fact that affects wellness , without understanding its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> <unk> of my lectures , the <unk> -- he said , he would have a symphony of music , and there was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the recording .
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that &apos;s the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruined was the distortion of experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music .
they don &apos;t care because he was possessed by a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten .
what &apos;s really telling us is that we think about ourselves and other people might think about two types of self .
there is a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , is able to experience the past , but it &apos;s just the present time .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; do it now hurt you ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self itself , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our lives are preserved , and it &apos;s that the doctor &apos;s a doctor who can address the question , &quot; how did you have ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey after albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self itself , and the <unk> self , and the two of them is part of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and it really starts with a basic reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not only telling stories if we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example of an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patient who &apos;s a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into details . it &apos;s not more painful , but she was painful than this trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re going to be asked , &quot; who owns them more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
the patient b has a lot of suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a <unk> , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how do these patients thought they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient has a much worse <unk> <unk> for the patient .
the stories of <unk> were disparate , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends up .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the worse is the worse , where the pain was at the end at its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we &apos;ve asked these people to be asked , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse to the b in the <unk> .
well , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of <unk> himself , b has got a worse time .
well , what you could do with the patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical trials , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually get the <unk> of the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient , and you can just get it to try to shake up with it .
this is what the patient is suffering , but only a bit and much less than before .
and if you make a few minutes , you have to make sure that the <unk> self is a bad at patient &apos;s patient , and you can make it a much better job of the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient , because now the patient has given a much better history of his experience .
so what draws a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that gives us that , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
and so a story of <unk> are a little , big moments and ends .
they &apos;re very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the <unk> itself is alive .
it &apos;s got a lot of the time , one after the other .
and you wonder , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean most moments of our lives -- and i did that -- you know , you know , you know , the psychological presence of life as about three seconds , which means , you know , it &apos;s about 600 million of them . in a month , it &apos;s about 600,000 million .
most of you will completely ignore the <unk> itself .
and yet , you get kind of the idea that you should count , what is happening during these moments of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re using as we are in the world .
and as we use them , it would be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the money with time .
from view of the <unk> self , if you have a holiday vacation and the second week , it &apos;s as good as the first , it &apos;s twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
this is how it doesn &apos;t work for itself .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is much better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in fact , in fact , the critical variable that is the critical variable that a <unk> self is different from a <unk> self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , the <unk> self makes more than remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually that &apos;s where if you have a patient , because if you have a patient who had a patient who had two different surgeons in two different surgeons , and decides what to choose , then is the one who has memory , which is less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s chosen .
the <unk> himself doesn &apos;t have a voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future after a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a tyranny of self , and you can think of yourself as a tyranny of self , and you think of yourself as one , you know , the <unk> self is not supposed to do .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing vacation , this is a very frequent decline , which is , we &apos;re supposed to go on holiday fields in the services of self .
and it &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> us from our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we &apos;ve done a few years ago , which was clearly the best holidays i &apos;d ever had , and i think quite often a lot of times i think about other people &apos;s relationship .
and i probably have my memories on this epic journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the <unk> , i would have spent 600 pictures in there .
now , these are three weeks , and this is only a half a year .
there seems to be a <unk> .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little <unk> i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you &apos;re making more , there &apos;s a real question , why do we give memories so much weight on the weight of the weight that we might find ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the day , you know that at the end of the day , they &apos;re all going to be destroyed by their images , and they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of time , you get an answer .
why we choose the <unk> , which we choose is a problem that provides us with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- lucky for moments is a rather complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness about happiness .
if you ask happiness of happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this isn &apos;t about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy is the person when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who isn &apos;t different from these terms of happiness on happiness , and i &apos;m involved in a lot of researchers , and i &apos;m involved with a lot of researchers about happiness for happiness .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and the satisfaction of the self has been realized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have asked them to think about their lives and talk about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about happiness of the two types of self .
and the main thing we do , i think , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy somebody is with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really teach them much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you meet somebody who would come and tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his height ?
well , they would know something about its height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight in a scale , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is , how happy he is about his <unk> .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is about .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied to be satisfied with people who we like to spend time with people that we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s the dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize the two types of self , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
so the implication of what i said here is that we &apos;re really not really supposed to imagine ourselves as a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very briefly , another reason we &apos;re not thinking about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same stuff as we think about life , and when we &apos;re thinking about life .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are not going to get the proper answer .
if you think that question is that people have to be happier in california , if you have to be happier in ohio .
and what &apos;s happening is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what makes you say , in the climate .
well , it turns out , climate is not very important for the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people that &apos;s going to move back to california .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , they &apos;re going to be reminded of the weather in ohio . and they &apos;re feeling that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , as a couple of weeks ago , i told you about a couple of weeks ago , that there was a pretty interesting outcome of this gallup survey .
is that something that you can do with you , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the gallup poll is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find absolutely .
and we found that in terms of happiness of life itself .
if we looked at how feelings relate to income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people who are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly unhappy , the poorer they will .
we &apos;re going to get a completely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money is that money buying a <unk> , but that lack of money in favor , and we can actually get this <unk> very , very clear <unk> .
in the sense of self itself , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you made is the happier .
that &apos;s not true emotion .
but danny , in the entire american department , it &apos;s about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be everything that we believe in the head , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance of politicians that would generally take the land generally as serious as the seriousness would take care of politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s credit for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be slow down in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , they &apos;re just going to happen and in other countries .
people are realizing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a long time , and people will discuss whether they want to explore <unk> or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we need to take this discussion pretty soon .
how to be lucky is very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next year .
in the united states , you know , in the united states , you have to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s what i think is going to be part of the national statistics or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this theme , or should , at least should be the most exciting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of the behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane . i design video games .
i develop 10 years of <unk> , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in order to save the world in order to save them .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , more time with playing more than more time playing games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little bit too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the center of the future is going to be , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we &apos;re going to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i calculated that the need for 21 billion hours a week .
it seems to be a little bit of <unk> , so i &apos;m going to repeat it , so if we &apos;re dealing with issues like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we &apos;re trying to play games online for at least 21 years .
no , i mean it seriously .
why ? this image is pretty much , why i believe that games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a tudor photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he was built in front of the players a camera .
this is one of the classic words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might give you some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also , you know , it &apos;s a really hard concentration to solve this problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you &apos;ll see some of the numbers here , looking at the top , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows indicate surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know , you know . ok . so . so , we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s very positive , they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to do something that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this player &apos;s a <unk> victory .
and this is what we need to see millions of faces from <unk> around the world , if we take the <unk> the next century to the next century , the face of the people who are on the edge of the <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life , if we &apos;re hard problems .
i call it as &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> , and it &apos;s actually my face , you know ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , like i &apos;m living in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home , california , california , where i looked in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re better in games better than real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in the reality of play .
and i don &apos;t only mean less successfully , even though it belongs to this .
we &apos;re going to be able to do more . i mean , i &apos;m good in the context of motivation , a little bit of <unk> , inspired to collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us are going to turn into our best version , at any time and instantly helpful to try to solve the problem , as long as necessary as necessary , it would try to make it <unk> .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing failure , we &apos;re not going to feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings we never have , if we play games , they &apos;re just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , to think , you could not just do anything ?
how can we put these feelings from playing into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to the world problem .
and i &apos;ve figured out some things that will make the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
so first , if you &apos;re in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing , and instantly .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at the same level in the game , right ?
so they &apos;re creating that .
they never get a challenge that they can &apos;t fix .
but always the edges of their capabilities , so they have to work , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you can &apos;t sit around and <unk> , and there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
and there &apos;s plenty of collaborators .
where you &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them , to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t really have that kind of life in real life , that feeling that we &apos;re ready to stand with a <unk> number of employees .
furthermore , this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve created &quot; level up &quot; up &quot; and &quot; + &quot; and &quot; + &quot; is a <unk> . &quot;
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have to talk about it : &quot; one crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so the problem of <unk> as the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;d rather much spend our whole time in the <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world &apos;s world has spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in the context of the context , <unk> million years ago started to walk our first <unk> .
so the first phase is primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play , this is just a sense of sense of the human development in terms of the human development , which is extraordinary .
but it &apos;s also appropriate . because it turns out we &apos;re using this whole time of using this whole time , actually changing what we are as people are capable of the situation .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think this is .
consider this interesting statistic , the recent university was released by a researcher mellon university -- the average boy spends <unk> , 10,000 hours have spent 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the u.s. , <unk> hours of the exact same time they spend in school , from five grade class to the high school -- if you &apos;re never absent .
so , here &apos;s a complete <unk> , where young people learn to be a good player , what it means to be a good player , like anything they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; i read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research research on the great research research , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study , we &apos;re going to be <unk> at the 21st century .
we &apos;re going to do whatever as well as most people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are gamers <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d never have a <unk> human potential .
so many people have a lot of people in the world who spend at least an hour per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion gamers that are extremely good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> technology developed <unk> , saving energy and work at work , rather than the <unk> , so that players can play , in india , china , brazil , online .
you would expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have a whole 1.5 billion player .
so i started thinking about what it is to do these games .
here &apos;s the four things that i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine that as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do , immediately , to do a bar , along with the belief that we have a shared hope on success .
gamers always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worthwhile to try and try and get it right now .
players don &apos;t sit around .
gamers are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that we &apos;re showing people more , after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve inherited , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone &apos;s game .
we trust that somebody spend time with us , that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and stay in the <unk> .
so this allows the <unk> to grow <unk> and trust .
as a result , we &apos;re building more powerful social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> 22 hours a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that when we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier to work , hard to work , as if we relax .
we know that we are as human beings work accurately , if we do hard , grand work .
and players are always willing to work hard if you get the right assignment .
and finally , it &apos;s going to matter .
players love it , part of awe <unk> <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> line to back the right light . you know , all wikipedia , the largest rainforest in the world .
the second largest rainforest in the world with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in every other corners of the world .
they created an epic story .
they created a <unk> source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is you think you &apos;re going to change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to be able to look at less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that it makes sense , actually , because gamers can be more powerful than in real life .
they can make more powerful social ties than real life in real life . they get more feedback and reward in games in real life .
so , he says , well , it &apos;s completely logical that player &apos;s gamers more time in the virtual world than in the real time .
i don &apos;t even agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event for 2,500 years .
you have these ancient cubes , from <unk> . you know ?
before these fantastic <unk> <unk> there were <unk> .
and these were actually the first of people <unk> .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> of the ancient greek <unk> , you may know this story . the story of how and why games are invented .
according to <unk> , games were playing games , in the kingdom of <unk> while famine was <unk> .
laennec , there was such great famine , that the king of <unk> himself decided to take a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> national strategy , you would eat a national strategy on a day , and the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because these games are so fascinating , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to <unk> , they survived this famine for so 18 years by eating and the next day .
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to play today .
we &apos;re playing a game to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing a game to avoid everything in the real world that doesn &apos;t work in real life , especially in real life , and we &apos;re going to give us what we need .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , after 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> , and they were allowed to break up to a paralyzing adventure .
they <unk> <unk> and looked for the quest for a new home , and they were left so many people to survive , looking for the rest of the food that they were thriving .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> shows that the <unk> , which later the roman empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists came to the notion that <unk> &apos;s crazy story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> that was almost 20 years of what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story is true .
maybe they actually saved their people through games by 18 years in games , and then they had <unk> and so much about these <unk> and so much about playing that they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization .
so we can .
we have been rejected since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world &apos;s world of <unk> . it was 16 years ago .
they were working for 18 years , we &apos;ve been rejected for 16 years .
i mean , we &apos;re ready to play our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to the search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should have <unk> that half of us spend an hour per day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask : &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and right , i &apos;ve got my work in the last years at the institute for the future .
we &apos;ve got this banner in our office in palo alto in palo alto , it inspires the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
so we want to think of the best outcome , and then people want to empower that idea into reality .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> and give people to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i designed to try to give people to give people <unk> in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a truism that you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s being realistic for them to be realistic , and they actually live in the real life with no oil , and they &apos;re <unk> in time , tell us how much oil costs , how much oil costs are .
we have tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to take the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive . most of our gamers have gone into the game of habits .
so we &apos;re going to give us a greater , <unk> play , higher goal than just <unk> .
we have the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
the point is the calculation of a belief that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the call of gamers , to sign up , we &apos;ve created almost like a &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ve got the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say , everybody is in <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can see if they &apos;re labeled &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we get on the third of march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of the world bank award , and in 2010 , in 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and invite them to learn socially .
we have a comic book . we &apos;ve got to understand &quot; level high , &quot; <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people , particularly in the world , particularly in <unk> , which is the benefit of being able to introduce their own social companies to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want you to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic gamers , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that they agree with me that are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make tight social networks , <unk> and demand meaning for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re going to play meaningful games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design these games and play .
when i <unk> in the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things : that we can make any <unk> future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s make the <unk> play .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what a couple of months ago in writing magazine is written a article on <unk> magazine .
i &apos;ve always got to write my <unk> at the time , but i was involved with the edit of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never <unk> my life in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled . &quot;
i read the front .
&quot; disabled , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong . &quot;
i have a list of a friend according to read and to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i just came up to read &quot; fans , &quot; and i could stop collecting and gathering me and collecting me , after this <unk> <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought the need to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i first started with elementary school , and began to create my sense of the self outside of my family and shapes in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i &apos;m not using a <unk> .
if i was to take this kind seriously seriously , i was born in a world that would be a person who could not run a positive way of life in no way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the odds and adventure .
so i immediately have to admit the ceo of 2009 , and i expected that i find a <unk> piece .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last words of all the words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of the <unk> societies , including the greeks and the roman , they really believed that the pronunciation is a great force , because what you have , you know , the pronunciation is a great force .
so , what do we want to do is <unk> -- disabled people or a powerful people ?
you know , just as a person who &apos;s <unk> as a child &apos;s child , it could evaporate and <unk> and beliefs .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up to open doors ?
a human being opened for me doors was a pediatrician at the <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most of the americans didn &apos;t necessarily mean correctly . so he was always dr. p. <unk> .
and dr. mullis was to fly very colorful , and i was making the work with kids just like that .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> <unk> .
i had to have some kind of work with this thick , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- in different colors -- that you know , i hated this bag more than anything else . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even seen as a <unk> child with dr. zullinger and try to stop this practice , <unk> , <unk> without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practice -- these practices were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so powerful , powerful and young girls , you &apos;ll get a day of this rigid .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. gore , so i make the exercise i didn &apos;t want to do , with the possibility that the richest five year-old girls are going to become in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my everyday <unk> with new eyes .
and i &apos;m going to ask myself today , as a very powerful and powerful young girl in my sense , and i could imagine that i could imagine as one of nature &apos;s powerful , powerful and <unk> person to see me .
this is just an example of a lot of how adults can boost the imagination of a child .
but just like the <unk> examples of the <unk> evidence , our language is not a room , to imagine something that we would all wish to be : every single one would enable you to see yourself as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that were gestated in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> , the <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> <unk> for the <unk> body that allow people to be able to use , really , really speaking socially , and they &apos;re going to have their own ability to do it .
so maybe that &apos;s what this sort of technology is more powerful , because the fact that there was always a different truth , which is that every human society can be something very powerful and very powerful , and that the human capacity , is to adapt , our biggest <unk> .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i &apos;m going to ask them to answer , and i &apos;m always saying to you , that sentence has never <unk> me , and i &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with this .
this is the phrase from the process of <unk> lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on it to be a challenge , without being successful , because if my life would be so successful , because if my life would be so successful with a prosthetic life .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge of the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically emotionally , emotionally .
and i claim that this is good .
<unk> is not an obstacle that we need to be <unk> to make our life better .
<unk> are simply in our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s really present to see it , but it &apos;s constantly to me .
and i want to have no effect of the impact , or the <unk> of a human race .
there are <unk> and challenges , and these are just <unk> real and every person else , and each person is about it , but the question isn &apos;t , whether we &apos;re going to get rid of it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to preserve before , but they &apos;re going to prepare good to get good .
and we don &apos;t like to make our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to the medical issue , to be an english and the other social mind , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability , which i needed to have to be , is that the world is constantly saying , she could describe me with those two words .
in our desire to protect people who are at heart , and the cold , hard to ask you the cold , hard to ask for your medical habits , or even having to look careful that we &apos;re not going to be disabled .
maybe the current concept that is just looking at what it is in a broken , and how we &apos;re going to fix it , for every one of a larger disability than the <unk> of the time .
if we don &apos;t treat them as a human , and not all of its forces and opportunities and recognize , creating addition to the natural fight that you might need to have , another disease .
we <unk> a person who has value for our society .
so we need to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the human possibilities .
most of the most important thing is that it is between perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> .
we should not be <unk> at these <unk> times or not , we should not try to avoid that , we should not try to see them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize the <unk> odds .
it may be more important to me realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome them necessarily , but that we &apos;re open to , you know , embrace it , embrace them on the <unk> for a <unk> , and you can actually use a <unk> <unk> and maybe dance .
and maybe we &apos;re creating it , <unk> as a bit of natural , <unk> and feeling useful , and feel like that &apos;s not going to happen .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . anniversary of charles darwin and he wrote about 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in a very true sense of human character .
i would use it : not the most powerful of its kind of survived , and not the <unk> of the kind of <unk> , but the way that changes changes best .
from conflict comes creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the capacity of the people , to survive and <unk> , from the fight of the human mind is determined by conflict .
so again , again , change and customization are the greatest capabilities of human beings .
and maybe we just don &apos;t know what wood is when we &apos;re going to be tested .
it may be exactly the sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves a little bit .
we can give a new meaning that is going to be about tough times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are facing a change that we haven &apos;t adapted .
i think the biggest damage that we have to rely on is to believe that we should be normal .
so honestly , who is normal ?
there is no normal normal .
you don &apos;t have the usual . that &apos;s the normal , but not the normal , gray person really want to learn , if you really existed ?
i think more rather than not .
it would be great , if we think of this paradigm of normal , or strength to be able to formulate a little bit more dangerous , and so we can produce the forces of a lot of kids , and they invite the forces of a lot of these many kids , and you invite them to bring them to society .
<unk> found out that we were asking people of the members of our society always have to be useful and useful .
there is evidence of evidence that neanderthals in 60,000 years ago , older people have joined with severe physical internal injuries , and it might be because the <unk> in the state of these people were valuable to society .
they didn &apos;t think these people as useless ; they were considered something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city in which i grew up , in the <unk> zone in the northeast red zone , and i was standing there in front of a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee &apos;s aimee . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i saw her first time , i took her her belly from her mom . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i knew from narratives about this day , because i was , of course , typical , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> medical diagnostics was on holiday , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , at all at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet turned to them , and i just had a couple of toes on this and a few toes at the other foot , he had to be the <unk> .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to go to your parents , and never be mobile phone , like other kids , or you &apos;ve never got an independent life , and they just have to lie . &quot;
really remarkable , i found that he was collected in my whole childhood , no matter whether i had gone through a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had a scholarship on the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , and he used to <unk> my scholarship or one of my <unk> at the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough , what is crucial to the quality of a human being .
and dr. <unk> once said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they &apos;re not told anything else , and even if you get a little bit of support , if you get kids a little bit , kids can get a lot . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone relate to it , two different things .
and i have changed my thinking over time , if you had asked me at the age of 15 years , if i had asked my <unk> on legs of meat and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i didn &apos;t want normal to work at that time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and this is what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened the doors for me , rather than people who wanted me to face or to give me an idea .
see , it &apos;s really just a human being able to demonstrate how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate your own , internal forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you &apos;re creating it , and for someone at a critical moment , you &apos;re going to open up a doors for those people .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something to produce something that is in one , the potential .
again , what do we want to do is <unk> ?
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , in britain , at the time , were transformed into <unk> .
they call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the u.s. , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are <unk> .
and the one of the students are <unk> harder for us to get the better teachers and so on .
they then have a <unk> period of students with a &quot; good note &quot; very good . they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they were <unk> , and after those three months , they &apos;ve really <unk> them .
and of course , it would be a heart to listen to the <unk> , the <unk> said , they &apos;re just sufficient .
and it was the same thing for three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had gotten the school .
the critical thing that was the trial was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were simply told that were the <unk> , and that &apos;s the students that are the students with the note , and they have a little trained and treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind is a mind that was broken , has no hope anymore . he finds no more <unk> of it , <unk> <unk> and our collective capacity of imagination .
but if we &apos;re creating it , the human mind is going to hope to continue to find yourself and other people around themselves and other people around it , be curious , and then we put our own forces .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and create new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and my friend <unk> <unk> , and the poem is , &quot; god knows god , doesn &apos;t know the god &apos;s name , but the god who knows just four words , he doesn &apos;t know .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are ?
imagine i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more precise , more precise , more and faster .
or you want to be <unk> , stronger force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be , better in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always <unk> after more creativity .
what would you like ?
what would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as you have creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose to make a good memory ?
a few more .
what about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to admit , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this just a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> theme here on the ted ted conference , but today i want to give you a point of a doctor &apos;s eye .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who also was a <unk> <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a essay in biology . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who are going to take evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good at the time , taking rid of your personal <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and you can give you the permission , and you can see it &apos;s wrong .
but if you accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ?
is it for other <unk> or whether it &apos;s even more <unk> ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this image , i put an bush as a center of <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> on the tops of these branches of success , they have survived ; it &apos;s <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , that &apos;s what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re zooming out of a common ancestors with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years .
in that time , there may be 20 or 25 different types of hominids of hominids .
some of them come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems as if we &apos;re right , we &apos;re right to the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the biggest part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is it clear that we can use that we can be able to use it , and the mechanisms of a shared bacteria can produce the protein of the human being able to produce <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> from the pancreas .
and while we &apos;re talking about bacteria , you know , every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than the cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think if antonio damasio asks you , think about the bacteria , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you could only want to be involved without struggle .
it &apos;s actually a easier way of bacteria , with <unk> <unk> , forced , forced , <unk> .
but otherwise they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , same as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping <unk> nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in the form of a species ?
or are we going to be able to become something else -- something that might be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back at the time of 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , was about four and a half billion years ago -- the first evidence of living species , maybe three to four billion years on earth -- and then the human species , maybe as much as a 800 or a billion years -- and then a billion years ago , and then the human species , and then a billion years ago -- and then the human species , and then the human species , and
in this giant <unk> symphony of the universe , life is just a short amount of <unk> ; the animal kingdom , as a single <unk> , is a little <unk> .
we were .
so this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope that there &apos;s an awful lot of <unk> .
well , when i was a college student at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i proposed something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , and all the genetic information , and all the genetic information is going into both of the cell .
but at the time , as <unk> organisms began to change things .
sexual reproduction is coming to the picture .
and all the important thing : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is touching the rest of the body .
in fact , in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of the body of our bodies are in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , having sex / death , death / death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but every year , it &apos;s got to my ability to have existed .
i &apos;ve come to understand the emotion of george burns , who &apos;s in las vegas , who &apos;s <unk> in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
in front of him , it &apos;s a gorgeous <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him , and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a physician was a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily even different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to recreate the health after a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the <unk> of the genome to <unk> , <unk> , generation generation generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i &apos;m like <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage to the next stage to drop to the sea .
i think we would all think of all the mood , the <unk> of all the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to go to immortality through my work .
i don &apos;t want it to die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily <unk> the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adjust the best in their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are present , and therefore the hot will survive , if fish are there , there would be a vacuum , a <unk> fish , but they &apos;ve managed to make it a <unk> environment .
so what does this mean when we look back what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and particularly what we &apos;re thinking about is how we <unk> the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a range of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached a way of balance .
and the reason for that is that it was all of us through medicine , but we &apos;ve succeeded in a lot of genes that would have otherwise been <unk> and have been removed from the population .
and second , we as a species of the environment that we have , that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us exactly exactly how we adapt to us .
and by the way , we migrate and cycle , and we &apos;re doing so much that they can &apos;t tell us that isolation is needed to say that isolation is necessary for evolution .
a second opportunity is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , <unk> from nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation goes , if we have a species on planet planet , there will be isolation , and the changes of the environment that might produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility of opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that isn &apos;t just easy , but it &apos;s led to us , and we decided to make ourselves as a <unk> .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s start looking at reality that people are now making decisions about their offspring , in some cultures .
they are , in some cultures , the election , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decides .
so think if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but it will lead to the body genetic adaptations that would cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or to eliminate the risk of risk or cheaper ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to want to do these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years ago .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
the next year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 and a half of a week .
it &apos;s not going to take it more long until the reality is that it &apos;s going to be the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
before a week ago , the national academy of engineering prize was the <unk> prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists that developed the natural process of the evolution of evolution to work faster and <unk> proteins in a more efficient way .
a couple of years ago , the researchers were awarded <unk> <unk> for his research in which he took a adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell is able to turn it into a <unk> cell .
these changes are in .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that not only protect itself , but also the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental trial in the gang using a vaccine that &apos;s grown into the cells of the cells in the cells .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all the reality and the future is going to be much more possible .
so just imagine two different changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what would be , if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if they could change the sperm and <unk> or the newly fresh egg in order to give your kids a better chance for a <unk> life -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want a healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same motor of science that can enable possible to prevent the changes to prevent disease , could allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of the ken <unk> , especially if you can expand it , with the next generation of <unk> ?
why don &apos;t we have the fast <unk> that will enable you to walk faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we &apos;re going to pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the properties that we want , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years of compress -- and maybe even the next hundred years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be able to deal .
do we use these decisions a society that is better , the more successful , more friendly ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to form a society <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we will need to do to make these decisions ?
in the good way in evil , and as you might think , they &apos;re going to make these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something you can imagine , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another , the <unk> <unk> helps to stand up and go to stand up .
we call these robots <unk> these robots .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning and give them an strength , and that &apos;s going to increase your velocity and help them think about it , for instance .
this is indeed the true <unk> of man and machine .
but it &apos;s not just that -- it &apos;s going to merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start to talk about the american soldiers who &apos;s wearing about 100,000 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the urge you want to wear more .
of course , this leads to some significant complication -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought that we would embrace this challenge , and we &apos;re creating a <unk> that would help with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or the human race <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds on <unk> terrain for many hours .
so his bold design allows it to go deep down to the time , to <unk> and <unk> .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then i &apos;m going to increase my strength and perseverance .
we are as far as to introduce this gadget to this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take a look at the <unk> website , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who have been sitting in the wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the population .
and this is a conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young people very young people who live in the <unk> of their lives -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 71 -- the fate of the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes around a <unk> , or it &apos;s the wheelchair .
and this is , by the way , 500 years ago , i &apos;ve got to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought that we could begin to write an entirely new chapters in mobility .
so let me introduce you to the <unk> , which is being carried by amanda <unk> , who suffered a <unk> of the time , that she could not run more than 19 years now and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors on the crutches , the signals on our <unk> , which is attached to your back .
this is also <unk> , the <unk> sits on their hips , likewise , just like their <unk> <unk> , which they move forward to this fairly <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> me .
in a fraction of a second , i lost each feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after a doctor , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
most of these technologies have technologies to learn to learn again , to climb again , to climb and even to go to the hands .
but nothing was invented me going to me again until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential to change life , to change life by future generations -- not just for the military , or for amanda , and all the wheelchair .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss the ceo of a non-profit organization called robin <unk> .
if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i <unk> myself as a <unk> <unk> of a volunteer fire .
well , in our city , in the volunteers of volunteers , they supported a very early <unk> to be the <unk> to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer for the <unk> , so i had quite good opportunities .
but it was still a race for the other volunteers to reach the <unk> and figure out what our job would be .
when i found the <unk> <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with the <unk> of her life , which is surely one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the <unk> and a barefoot on a screen outside the <unk> rain , while her house was burned in flames .
the other volunteers , who arrived in front of me -- let &apos;s call him <unk> <unk> -- reached the <unk> of the first and asked asked to save the dog &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who was now able to tell the rest of his life , the people could tell him to save a living house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; well , i have to go to the house .
you &apos;ve got to go up to the end of the fire , and you have to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i was hoping for me , but i went on -- the stairs , the hallway , by the time , at that point , they were <unk> , at the bedroom , in the bedroom to a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my fingers back down , where i was the front door my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our treasures out of the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention was much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> had a letter of the <unk> that she &apos;s putting themselves for the brave use of the <unk> .
and one of the things that &apos;s valued is that somebody had brought her to a pair of shoes .
both in my profession at the same time in my inbox , i was <unk> , and in my <unk> , i witnessed generosity and kindness at the big scale , but i also see how engagement and <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room , and people see people either have reached success , or on their way , i want to offer them to offer them , i want to offer the following memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in life of another one , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you give something , they give it now .
they use them in a <unk> , rooms in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day every day will give us a chance to save lives , but every day offers us to change one day .
so they get rid of it ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the mystery of the human race .
a place where women lead the <unk> , &quot; hi , saying &quot; hello , &quot; and the game that &apos;s a serious matter of being serious .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> either or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their neighbors .
this is the world of wild bonobos from congo .
bonobos are related to chimpanzees our next living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are famous for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of human evolution in history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees of great , fear <unk> are going to be <unk> by <unk> females .
they really came up with me , because this leads to a <unk> society in which fatal violence has not seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known as primates .
they &apos;re living in the deep depths of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re very hard .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the violence of a violent argument that has been <unk> for decades , and almost so many lives , like the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t be surprised that this destruction of the bonobos are at risk .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> , you could not even be able to fill a trip with the <unk> bonobos -- and even because we &apos;re not safe to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh , that the trees are upset .
who are these related ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , because they &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so much conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos is made more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play long .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and she &apos;s a game essential for connection with relationships and the <unk> .
this is how we trust and the rules of the game .
play is <unk> creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobos , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> of us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she puts it in the <unk> . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
yeah .
so <unk> are spread , both in bonobos than humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that you &apos;re creating new elements -- like the testicles -- and also how the <unk> -- and also , how the game is , both of the trust .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take a lot of shapes that some of these things are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to explore the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think exactly how they &apos;re going to do sometimes sometimes , and we <unk> limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected elements that we &apos;re creating is the real estate of creativity .
this is just a little predictor of the insights that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but it also true a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and institutional cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
so to be successful in a <unk> world , we have to play .
but are we going to make the best from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , and people have equal to their own teeth and claws alone .
right now , if it doesn &apos;t seem to be very , you know , play a <unk> .
and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and together , while we &apos;re talking about creativity and wonder , as we <unk> creativity .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in 1979 , in 1979 , at the same day , in the same moment , each <unk> -- okay .
so two pairs , each <unk> is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want them to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you think the whole time you &apos;re going to listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case that sperm sperm a y wears a barrel of the <unk> chromosome .
and in the other case , it &apos;s the sperm chromosome that hits the x chromosome .
they &apos;re both <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;re going to go back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hats .
in a hat , i &apos;m in the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m studying <unk> , and in this case , i study how people <unk> anatomy with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- like <unk> <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i was carrying on my work is the <unk> , as <unk> -- or , as i say , as a grown-up lawyer -- or people , the patient &apos;s lawyer -- by people who are .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have resisted social norms in question .
so i worked with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were very common .
and very often i worked with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who are not the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different shapes .
i just give you a few examples of the kinds of <unk> that are not the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> <unk> the <unk> , which we have the <unk> stage of <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the testes are at the <unk> stage .
but because of that individual individual is missing the receptors , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so testosterone testosterone , but not a reaction .
as a consequence , the body develops more to the typical female course .
if the child was born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as girls .
but it &apos;s usually time until they reach puberty and grow to grow and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone &apos;s coming out there is something else .
and they &apos;re doing a few tests and find out that instead of <unk> and uterus , in fact , they &apos;re usually <unk> into action , and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you might think that you might be a male for male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something they call <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> are <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual life , but i think i probably probably have the typical -- most women like i &apos;m talking about <unk> .
we &apos;re creating <unk> and we &apos;re talking at <unk> .
so the implication is that somebody like i actually had a brain that was subjected to more <unk> than a woman who was born with their testes , and a <unk> has been born .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , can you be distributed throughout the range of the range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as young as a boy , he had a girlfriend , and he was a girlfriend , he had a girlfriend , he was living in his girlfriend , and he had figured out he was <unk> and he had an uterus .
he had an extreme form of <unk> .
he &apos;s got <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> <unk> so that they basically created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> of their <unk> was to be the <unk> male part of the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody could see something .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he &apos;s inside the <unk> , that the physicians found that he was inside the inner female .
okay , just another quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , creating something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different ways .
the reason kids with this kind of bodies -- be <unk> or identical twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often being adapted to the norm , isn &apos;t because this is the physical health of users .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
and the reason they &apos;re doing many different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain of anatomical expression with one particular identity .
so we have the concept to be a woman , is to have a black identity , meaning to be a black person , is supposed to be an african anatomy .
so we have this terribly <unk> idea .
and when we &apos;re confronted with a body , which is actually something very different to us , <unk> us in terms of these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> ideas .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , two people are in a body .
now , where i had experienced most of the excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender was initiated in berlin <unk> <unk> <unk> in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me a question of question : &quot; what test will you do , which tells us whether <unk> <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that this didn &apos;t exist .
so we know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature is not a line between the male and female , or between the male and <unk> and <unk> , we are <unk> and <unk> .
so we have a situation where we &apos;re going to stop our science at the time , so we need to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve held for stable disabled categories , which made very simple <unk> to create permanent <unk> <unk> .
and it &apos;s not just related to gender .
it &apos;s also true in terms of race , which is as much more complicated than our <unk> allowed .
in our <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to push through the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we only differ by a few <unk> ?
while we continue to push our science increasingly , we &apos;re increasingly going to get into a <unk> area of the <unk> , where we need to recognize the <unk> categories that we &apos;re probably very simple .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
one of the spaces that we see that for the <unk> , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard talks about what &apos;s going to be a body for people , so that he &apos;s quite quite rightly as a distinctive life .
we have a very difficult deal with this -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have never been hard to fight when someone was dead .
you know , they &apos;re only given a feather under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them .
if you don &apos;t move more , you &apos;ve been buried .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people open organs to connect to other people &apos;s organs .
and as a result , we turned to the fight with the really hard question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really hard position in which we don &apos;t have to have more simple categories like earlier .
now , you could think that the whole thing was the <unk> of <unk> somebody really happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these are really much more insecure than we thought , i &apos;m tense .
and it makes me become a little bit of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to shut back first that i am a big fan of the founding .
i know that they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in what they did for me all of the few years of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened with the <unk> <unk> .
the organizers were in my view the original activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were using it through another , that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember all the founding , our founding fathers had the idea of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power to have these political power , because the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s father &apos;s son and so on .
and the organizers meadows this idea back and replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept , that all the people have created the same time .
they <unk> the field , and decided that <unk> saw the commonalities , not the difference , and that was very radical .
now they did this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things together in common .
democracy is growing up , but at the same time , the science grew .
if you look at the history of the founding of the founding , many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from the <unk> of the way , and meadows things like a sinister concept of power , back , where the transmission is based on a very <unk> <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they took us a concept that was about <unk> commonalities .
and so they &apos;ve been prepared for a really wonderful way of the future .
they haven &apos;t thought about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened next ?
for example , women used to be the <unk> , the concept of the founding , which is the founding of the founding of the poets , and they said , &quot; that we have a uterus and a lot of the difference that we should not have the <unk> and <unk> , which is not important enough to own .
and women <unk> successfully .
as the next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , i &apos;m not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of <unk> , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different skin color , which are <unk> <unk> , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the commonalities , we need to start asking for question why we maintain certain <unk> .
now , mind mind , i want to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish not the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to tell you that <unk> should have the right to sex consent or to get married .
so there &apos;s some of anatomical sites that make sense for me to make sense , and we think , keep it .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep them , and if they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 , both the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of <unk> was born , so she was born by june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born the <unk> , and he was born at the march of 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born by being born three months of <unk> , she takes all sorts of <unk> for three months of <unk> -- the <unk> sex has to choose the right .
<unk> to all these wait , not because he &apos;s actually a different biological age , just because of the birth of his birth .
we &apos;re going to find other differences in what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think he &apos;s a male -- although i haven &apos;t told them that he &apos;s with <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can now be moved to what &apos;s wrong .
maria , can &apos;t be able to perceive all the same states that <unk> <unk> in all states , and that &apos;s right to get married .
<unk> <unk> can be married in every state , but maria can only marry a woman &apos;s wife .
so we have these permanently <unk> categories that are more problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is going to make progress in anatomy that we need to admit that democracy is a democracy based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science on its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems as a dignity of a sort of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to move somewhere somewhere , so we &apos;re going to move somewhere somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so , for instance , texas , texas at a point , is that a man to marry a <unk> chromosome , and a woman to marry a woman , is that you have a <unk> chromosome .
now in practice , people are not allowed to test .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says , we don &apos;t want to ask people to &quot; their skin , but the quality of their character , &quot; judge , and goes on anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you learn people on their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re supposed to be <unk> in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden <unk> that probably are more vulnerable than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably know some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligently , more intelligently , more likely to meet their sexual relationships than some <unk> .
so how are we supposed to <unk> the properties of nature &apos;s properties ?
it turns out , really hard .
and a part of me wonder what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- using an mri visible ?
do we really want to go in this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is struggling to make thoughts about questions about questions of democracy .
in our quest for democracy , we made our job right now , and i think we would make our job in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , for instance , in iran , where a man who wakes up to other men &apos;s being attracted to death , it &apos;s because he &apos;s ready to perform a <unk> , in which case he can stay alive .
we don &apos;t exist in this way .
i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon with whom i spoke a few years ago , who had a few previous twins twins with himself to separate them .
but when i <unk> him with him , and he asked him why he made these same surgeries -- was his answer that was very bad at his country , these children would be very bad treated , and so he had to do it .
and i responded to him , &quot; well , they &apos;ve learned political practices rather than a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they are , without changing the state of will change .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of democracy as democracy might be , or looked , if we had the moms to do more .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a feminist is something radical , and i think there could be different ways of insights that are using different kinds of anatomy from the anatomy of the anatomy , <unk> people .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i was also interested in research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things that i really felt really interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not every , but in average -- more complex social relationships and the caring for people who are vulnerable to people who are in the group of vulnerable .
and therefore , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i asked a graduate student , one of my favorites , my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so i was -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about <unk> about gender , which is feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is supposed to be a little bit , in the average , in the average , which is female leaders from male to different social relationships , what makes us feel for <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for that .
so where the organizers were extreme , to find out how individuals could be protected from the state of protected , it &apos;s possible that if we <unk> more mothers into this concept , we &apos;re more like to protect the concept of this concept , not just how to protect each other .
and maybe that &apos;s what we need to do in the future when we &apos;re going to <unk> democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies to think of their identity , and more about relationships .
so , if we &apos;re trying to make as people try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got to do is i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find out every chance to find a different <unk> configuration , to photograph the last time , and i &apos;ve come to photograph at the last time and to meet .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of second hand hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> <unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my body and even my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars serve for a good imperative ; i &apos;m quite unique ; i &apos;m quite unique ; it &apos;s <unk> to my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my height ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i sat on for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pair of bags , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> <unk> is everything i did in my suitcase .
i have a bet that i wanted to wear anything i could wear , find , if i first wanted to go to palm springs .
and since they &apos;re not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s driving here at ted in her underwear -- is that i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i want to give you my favorite <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to tell you some of the lessons i don &apos;t think or not , i &apos;ve learned from these <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call it the shining tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look at less than 50 dollars .
this kind of outfit , including the jacket has 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this entire week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be <unk> bad , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you move other happy people .
tuesday : customization will be totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life , trying to be able to be , i think , and adapt to me .
be just who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the right people , you will not just understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i looked like i dress up , or i remember them .
i smile like , &quot; thank you , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think , you look in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only as i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to sum up for you .
if you believe they &apos;re in the inside and the outside , there are a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience here .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- <unk> words : golden <unk> .
and finally , saturday , saturday , personal style , is a great way to tell the world to tell a word , without having to say a word .
it was always getting me and over again , when there was people coming up to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home after brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn is to learn this week is okay .
i don &apos;t have to emotional these things emotionally , because the right thing about the road is always another crazy thing , <unk> <unk> <unk> , waiting for me to wait me , if i love a little bit in the heart and find it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , everyone together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young boy in italy grows with this image in his bedroom , but the reason i show you this is what i show you , which is the formula for the last decades .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula for a race , she took her budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver &apos;s good enough , you won the run .
now , if you want to win , if you want to win a race like this -- something like this -- something of the car in real time , a few thousand sensors , the information from the system , and then apply that information to the system , and then they use them to make it <unk> .
this would be , in <unk> , a <unk> call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting is what &apos;s interesting is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities became , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they become a computer in the free .
and as a computer , in free , they start reacting to other ways they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
across the cities , pulling all this view and the power of the everyday life of the everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli later on moma later , in the year , organizes .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if each atom is out there , a sensor , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as the old dream of hate ...
you know , as a michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he took off the hammer , and in fact , you can still see a little <unk> <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well , today , our environment , for the very first time to respond to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , again , with the idea of defining our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that .
so the first project i want to show you is in fact one of the first of our labs .
it was about four and a half years ago .
and what we did was actually used to use a new kind of network that was used to be used in the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk> information from this network to make sense of that network , to understand how the city is collected .
the summer of the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was in italy , the <unk> won .
some of you will remember , it was in italy when italy played in france , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no , in italy , in italy .
now look at what happened on this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you see in the middle of the middle , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
in the afternoon , people in this afternoon , people who make the calls and move .
the game starts by -- silence .
france is a portal . in italy , a portal .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second <unk> <unk> . end of the normal time .
first of all , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
italy wins . yeah .
well , at that night , everyone went to celebrate the center to celebrate .
they saw the big meaning .
the next day , everyone was the center to meet the <unk> and meet the prime minister at the time .
and then everyone went down .
and you can see the image of the place <unk> <unk> , where , since the rome of the time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the answer at the end of the day .
well , this is just an example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we could not have a few years ago .
another one is another example : this is not about people , this isn &apos;t about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
well , nowadays , we know all about where our stuff come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , as they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed a few little markers around the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started working with a couple of volunteers that have helped us something more than a year in seattle to tag the things that you can see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things they would throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little chips , the little brands and getting it to track .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;re just going to get .
by seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things that actually do with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day every day that the cup of the cup we throw away , not just the time on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we just throw away every day .
and if we &apos;re going to show people , then we can drive a behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more about that , and the many other wonderful things you can do with you can tell you , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part , and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> spain .
it started with a question of a <unk> question that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a nice tradition of water to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you bring technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were in a <unk> <unk> was , you know , you know these tubes , and the valves , <unk> , valves , they open up and close .
they do something like a <unk> <unk> of water .
if you fall down these <unk> , you can write the pattern , images , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to you , and it will be open to the picture .
well , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it &apos;s got very much like him .
and we got the assignment to design a building of the expo .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and let it go .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s drying out , if you want to reduce it , you can actually leave the roof down .
or you could end up the building , and the whole architecture will be , like in this case , you know , this day , when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they haven &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just like the architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who questioned what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test , the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i want to tell you what one night happened than all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was a little bit more fun at that night .
all the kids out of <unk> came to the buildings , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open up to you , but a building that is still breaks and black and holes in the water , you had to jump in the water .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , designers , as designers , we always think about how the people , the things we &apos;re creating .
but the reality is always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> <unk> that <unk> water and the projection .
and this is what we got to think about the problem that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine if you could start to fly these <unk> .
imagine if you &apos;re able to have little air that flies through the air , and each of them , with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you saw earlier , that moves with other things , completely in sync .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or an ad , like these -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or <unk> , but in three dimensions , where what changes the light is , is not the position of <unk> .
they can play different species .
imagine in front of the screen just in different parts of <unk> or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could just be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can go to , and through that you can move through them , and you can see them from many , many directions .
and here you see a real <unk> , which is <unk> to form a <unk> v .
if you turn the lights , it looks like this . so just as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is being channeled .
it could every single amount of having a impulse that comes from people , from the motions of people or something .
so i want to show you something here .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in <unk> -- we &apos;ve taken its movements in 3d <unk> to use it as a recipe for the <unk> .
here &apos;s <unk> dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can understand the whole movement .
you can make it all the time .
but then , if we all have all the <unk> , you can play with color and motion motion and <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working in the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to take people to do the people in order to make a difference and the environment -- almost as something we call , <unk> pathways like a <unk> , but a cloud .
imagine if anyone can give a little <unk> for a <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the remarkable thing that &apos;s happening last year , last decades , the last decades is that we have shifted from a physical world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it accessible to the internet .
nowadays , for the first time , we can -- and the <unk> obama showed that -- can we move from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the networks of the world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow is the morning to ask us the challenge -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to change .
so the idea is that we &apos;re actually creating people with what they &apos;re doing together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water as our cloud , as our cloud is a cloud .
it &apos;s an actual physical creature in london , but with <unk> .
they can move in the inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually see it in the bottom of the bottom , which is the most important moments for <unk> and more than the kind of connection to exploit .
so both of the things that the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go , like <unk> new <unk> .
you can go inside .
and some sort of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for anyone to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the connection is very important .
by my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are separated from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
i was <unk> awe .
my heart <unk> , i was <unk> , while i was trying to figure out what was inside me .
the <unk> around me was 60 feet from the water , and i was just wonder that this was a snowflake on a different sphere , year after year .
<unk> are born as a <unk> of a glacier or by putting out of <unk> .
each of the <unk> has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their surroundings and their experiences .
some refusing to give up and <unk> until the bitter end , while others can &apos;t withstand more and more of the <unk> of passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think it &apos;s easy to be isolated , separate and alone , quite as we humans see .
but the truth is far away .
while a iceberg melt , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
while the iceberg is melting , it &apos;s <unk> drinking water that feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go back to my footage that i would make portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments in these individual moments , and never exist .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but a <unk> of her <unk> along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last images i &apos;d like to show you show is a iceberg that i have in greenland in greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
i want to look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
he <unk> about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , just show you the iceberg , a different side of his personality .
thank you very much .
my life is really extraordinary to work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading years of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes yet .
i told him .
i have a company , the design and animations , and this is inevitably a more complex part of what we admire in the world and watch .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and his cause .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we will give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him again , and i asked , &quot; wait a minute , i saw stephen hawking -- cannot all the <unk> people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he replied , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody have a film called &quot; <unk> and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- so they walk along the fingers .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check , and instead i put a check out of a check that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how i needed him .
i &apos;m going to ask myself to the place , and i &apos;m committing to his brother and his father -- &quot; well , my suggestion is like this : tony &apos;s going to talk to him , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all this to do is not communicate . &quot;
so i was talking about a conference for a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , <unk> research , and they have a technology that allowed them to put a light on to each surface , and then drawing a light on the negative area , which is just the negative area .
so they move around and do <unk> like this .
they &apos;re saying all things that will be shown on the top , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> and the final people are actually art .
but there was always a life life in its presentation .
so i went home and dinner with my wife at night and she was telling her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you should find a way that <unk> can control a laser , so that we can make it a way that he could be doing .
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of organization , we &apos;ve done some things .
first , we have the insurance companies that have the doors , and actually have a device to get a device to have a device that he can communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or get an e-mail , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is amazing . &quot;
and also , we have seven ceos from around the world -- literally from all around the world -- literally from all around us .
my wife , my children , and i pulled in the garage , and this hackers and programmers and <unk> have taken our house .
so many of our friends thought that we were beautiful enough to do that , and that we &apos;re <unk> and all the pictures on the walls were <unk> .
but for two weeks , we &apos;ve been programming , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children were involved , my dog and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they put it on a <unk> machine , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to it -- you can make it yourself , we put the code for free , which is the software for free .
so we created a device that &apos;s fully free of limitations .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital .
so , every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that &apos;s incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to <unk> .
i love this image because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and this is his bedroom .
now , there &apos;s all this <unk> unveiling of the great unveiling .
and after a year , two weeks of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , drew for seven years ago .
and this is an amazing image , because this is his life support system , and he sees his life support .
we &apos;ve tended to go down , so he can see it outside .
we put a match on a wall of the <unk> in front of the hospital .
and he drew again once the first time , in his family &apos;s family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
we also had to <unk> into the parking lot into the parking lot , so we felt as a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he was sending us an email with this content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel the feeling , i got under water , and finally someone got down to down and down my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that stunning ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that holds us in the runway , and let &apos;s continue to evolve .
and we need to improve much on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
and someone who has a <unk> potential for so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the organizers were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , we &apos;ve been honored as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of this is -- and this includes all the circle -- that this april , the <unk> <unk> in downtown los angeles is going to show an exhibition called &quot; type of the <unk> . &quot;
and there will be pretty much the hardest practitioners of the <unk> to be present -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty scary .
so basically , i think , if you look something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all right here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i never had anything to do with <unk> , but i &apos;ve just collected something , and i was surrounded by amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question , every one of them should be , every single day that you &apos;re doing something that needs to be done , if not now , when you do ? and if not i , who ?
thank you .
so i &apos;m writing for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most commonly <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t like a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen a farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany , it &apos;s usually something you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was one of the one week in the <unk> green and blue <unk> , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the <unk> .
they did <unk> .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i was getting it into the &apos; 80s , i was very important to work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i received the middle of the night a call from this teacher , woman post , saying , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come up with a man with the man that i know you &apos;ve found out there .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to go .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laugh , and we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we went around them , and we gave her family eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know as adults , i met myself , she turned to a box full of ash , and got into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of the revelation that i was talking about .
the revelation is , the death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i enjoyed her .
and you know , this part of life takes everything the rest of life needs .
he takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned .
he needs the same -- he takes love , love and delight , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
so imagine a big explosion , as you move on to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine if you &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
this is <unk> <unk> .
well , i had a unique space on that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot <unk> the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route .
he switches the engines .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was to finish up .
so i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have these <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people that i wanted to make a hand and didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to do , and i didn &apos;t make the experience .
while i thought about it later , i noticed a phrase that is : &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is far , and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to do anything more about life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about that day -- and that was when we got george washington bridge , so pretty much about <unk> -- there was a thing that i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i <unk> , i &apos;m better to get better than what i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego space .
and i <unk> the time i wasted things for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i don &apos;t have two years with my wife &apos;s wife .
it feels great .
i don &apos;t try to have more , right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inner clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to crack in 20 parts as you know it from a documentary .
while we &apos;re <unk> , i had this feeling , man , to die .
almost like we prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and the sadness <unk> really is in a thought that i just wish one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
after a month , i went to my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> talent ...
don &apos;t yet .
and i <unk> , i know like a little kid .
and in the world , all the meaning for me .
i realized at that time , i realized that it was just a great father to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my first goal to be a good father .
i became the miracle of the miracle , not to die .
i got another gift to see , namely in the future , and come to life .
my call all of you who are flying today is : imagine the same thing that happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine how would you change ?
what would they do that they do , because they think they &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents who can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want to make the iran building the bomb .
the key <unk> there is the <unk> of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
so if we &apos;re able to figure out the systems of the systems that <unk> and the control of control , we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are running <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , it &apos;s an effective <unk> on a laptop that &apos;s used by a <unk> <unk> to <unk> these gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will <unk> in the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s a cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to <unk> our research six months ago , i was completely unknown , which was the purpose and purpose of that <unk> .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the <unk> part , the <unk> part , made by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed a little <unk> in these <unk> boxes that <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we had our environment with <unk> infected , and examined this .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> <unk> looks like a <unk> that doesn &apos;t like the cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made in my eyes no sense .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to my attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> is active in the gray box of the gray box , even when the special <unk> is discovered , even when the special program is , it &apos;s going to get a <unk> .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , this was really my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> station in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> code , and we found that in two digital warheads , a smaller and larger .
and we also noticed that they were very keen constructed by people who were apparently designed all the <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> them to attack .
probably , you know , even the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard about it , the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s complex and is high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science science .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart .
so what we were looking at first was <unk> <unk> , because we know what this cause .
and then we were looking for <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring this with the real world in conjunction with potential goals .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or to prove .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely <unk> <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be iran in iran because most of the infections were reported .
well , in this area , there are not several thousands of goals .
and basically , it goes beyond the <unk> nuclear power and the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants . &quot;
and i called them and <unk> her knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring that little digital <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
so the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you measure the speed of this <unk> , you can actually crack the damage to the foragers , and actually explode the <unk> .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually in fact , it &apos;s slow and <unk> -- obviously in trying to make <unk> <unk> , so that they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to get quickly behind it .
so the big digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse by showing ourselves very precisely data and <unk> .
so for example , the number <unk> comes out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i began to <unk> scientific literature , about how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called <unk> , and any <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it could fit together .
and it was better .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 layers .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that fit together .
and this was the great confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just the way .
these results have been done by several weeks .
and often we ran into a <unk> , and we had to start fresh .
but anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads in reality is actually , and the same thing is <unk> , but in different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rotors and slow it down , and the big <unk> comes with six <unk> of interactions and manipulated .
so , in large , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;re really confident that we &apos;re in what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- made me <unk> .
down there is the gray box , and you can see the <unk> .
well , what does this thing is , it &apos;s the <unk> values of sensors -- and for instance , by <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> code for the attack , which is still under the attack with the wrong .
and in fact , this is the wrong <unk> data from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> where it &apos;s fed with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> <unk> in the room .
in fact , it &apos;s more dangerous and more vulnerable .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need some digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station for instance , if the big <unk> is too fast , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so this is where we need digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re at risk , bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the <unk> , nor the <unk> will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i say is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station , or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- you have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to be able to put a <unk> stick on a <unk> stick .
you could also use a lot of <unk> technology .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the implication that we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is that attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green environments , these are the environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we need to make the consequences of us .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was very much about reported that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> of the time .
is it also ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s a <unk> involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , luckily .
because otherwise our problem would be larger .
thank you that you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i spent the last couple of years studying myself in situations which usually be very difficult and they &apos;re kind of dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i photographed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing to eat anything -- fun at the beginning , a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the greatest part of my career looking at <unk> situations , and that &apos;s just for trying to study society as well as you are compelling , and hopefully in a way to understand what they &apos;re excited for the audience and make it more fun .
so when i knew that i would come here to come here in a tedtalk the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would make a little different .
some of you may be heard about ebay a couple of weeks ago on ebay .
i sent some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some of the happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , given the unexpected opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never leave the time -- to buy the <unk> of the talk that you &apos;re seeing at the time was not having an title .
so what you &apos;ve got was , you know , your name here is : my tedtalk , which you have no idea of what &apos;s going on , and the one that &apos;s going to be able to fly the ears to fly the ears in particular , especially if i was a company .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning i knew anyone would buy the ticket .
if you had asked me this one year , i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project , i &apos;m working on my new film , we study the world of marketing , the commercials .
as i said , i was going to go in some pretty terrible situations in some pretty terrible situation , but nothing could prepare for me to do anything so hard and so dangerous like this guy to go into a room .
you know , i had an idea for a film .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , using the whole film going through <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what &apos;s going to happen in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from top up to the beginning , from the beginning to the end , totally <unk> -- by <unk> , which you &apos;re going to see in the film that is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> center ...
these people are being connected by the film in egypt -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to note .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to be the brand x <unk> , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the film .
so we may sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever had ...
the biggest car that they &apos;re ever driven , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a message of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides being able to show that brands are a part of life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the concept , the whole film , from beginning to end up .
and i would like to be happy if i was going to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how resourceful people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use it , because that &apos;s an negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop this ?
how much money is needed to do that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it in every case , some really known brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we see a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think about how the answer is ?
the answer is very likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing about the film or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
so , meaning , not so optimistic .
so , my doctor , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people they have to do it .
there are some places that we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; well , put the camera out of &quot; dignity that we wanted to make a <unk> .
it turns out it meant that it meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just disappeared these companies , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept of advertising is to present your product as many people to present as many people as you can see .
especially in the world today , this intersection of new and ancient media landscape and the <unk> media landscape -- isn &apos;t it the idea to be in this new exciting exciting thing that makes you mass .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was that .
no , it was no mistake at all .
that would have no problem whatsoever .
that would have been okay .
but what this image is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re in transparency , this is one of the first images -- this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and <unk> , just to discover and understand immediately ; <unk> from <unk> and the access to information , especially , what <unk> is , surely , the last line is surely the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to it , it &apos;s going to be done , changes .
but why ? well transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and she &apos;s very risky .
what else is a bonus ?
a whole bowl of eating food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in the <unk> -- and there he is , he sits and looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there is three versions of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only one company that was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i have john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to do it alone , i had to go and do it directly with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to understand , is a <unk> problem .
i have friends , the big , giant <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends , the little <unk> of me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> <unk> , say why their films are so successful , to the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> <unk> , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see words in the movie ?
always , when i make myself on the way , and whenever i open the <unk> , you will see you &apos;re going to see <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so much ? they look slightly nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview in front of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have choices .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as women -- solid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can ask all your questions and give you an <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so these kinds of things -- you know , reminds me of <unk> people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
so what words would you describe ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
woman : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way you supposed to describe something under the <unk> .
we speak by <unk> , fresh .
i think , &quot; <unk> , &quot; is a great word to make a positive positive , unlike &quot; eternal odor and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy in the street who are like me , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love beautiful clothes .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> meets <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is , &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and such stuff .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and a stuff .
woman : if dan would be a brand , he probably would be a classic poet <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman # 2 : partly , i guess partly , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man # 3 : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> throughout the country , globally .
so i think that this is my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man # 5 : brand <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i often look at the intersection of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could enter my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the <unk> .
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
if you could do it for them , they could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
tell me of this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way that you live in life , work and so .
and all of these things come from a place , and for me , they come from me and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what kind of context is that the thought and feelings about it ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i love things that are different .
i love things that are weird . i love weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you do ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? in what <unk> are they currently ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represented the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them that are not them .
so what &apos;s going on ?
... this is not to be frightened . in what kind of rollercoaster do you have ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . it &apos;s good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there was quite a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> had two separate separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are going to focus just on a strength , rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid the things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re terrified , and they turn them to be in a little bit of positive , and they turn them in a little bit of positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands are acting ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , actually , in the end , a mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a very powerful thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if anyone asked you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , what would you be ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? they &apos;re something that &apos;s carrying blood in <unk> ?
or are they more likely ?
are you something a little quiet , <unk> , conservatives ?
<unk> are things that are playful , <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , profane , <unk> and <unk> .
or are they rather like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they created , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate ?
are you reliable , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and wise as the dalai lama ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that are up and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s got 17 <unk> who were willing to give up to the control of the control that they wanted to do with someone to tell them how to tell them , to tell stories , to tell stories that we don &apos;t have to tell -- stories that would not have to support .
and they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using <unk> nowadays to do the <unk> of the brain , both of doing ads .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> was banned .
in the entire town , for five years , there &apos;s no <unk> , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school in school where companies are in <unk> schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of which i received most of the feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what those brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really be their interests in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
and i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is going to think of the world .
and what was that for you ? what do it succeed ?
well , since the film , the film i had launched , we can look at this .
according to <unk> , the introduction in january , and then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
in fact , it &apos;s only one tenth of two two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be .
there isn &apos;t even online . no <unk> .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
well , after all , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , at almost every single <unk> that we were talking about , paying her to the fingers .
something i believe is that if you take a chance of taking your opportunity to take risks , you know that they &apos;re putting out of these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you trained your employees to avoid hazards , you know the whole company prepared for a profit .
i feel the feeling that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of what they might be .
finally , in the process , we should be able to make fear .
we should put the bear inside the cage .
bless the fear . configure your risk .
they &apos;re full of <unk> , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we need transparency .
nowadays , more than ever before , we get a little bit of a lot of a lot .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they presented with me of the good friends of <unk> , the $ <unk> <unk> for the taliban <unk> <unk> .
big data will transform for organizations around the world into big opportunities .
<unk> presents : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
thank you very much .
so morgan morgan , on the name of transparency , what &apos;s happened to the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check at the height of dollars in the next year to finance .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago , i was doing something else at google , and i intend to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is also , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> trials and stories that can i tell you , with 17 very interesting museums out of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to concentrate on the future .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and her access to it .
i grew up in india .
i became an amazing education -- i &apos;m not -- but i didn &apos;t -- but i had a lot of the museums and this artwork .
so when i went to visit , and i went to visit these museums , i began to learn a lot .
and while i was working on google , i was trying to make this desire -- art design -- to lead to technology .
so we created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning of the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to be <unk> .
you can look around in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , van gogh gogh .
i actually come in one one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
it comes in two ways -- very easy .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and <unk> .
you want to get in the museum ?
open the map you open , and you jump with a click .
they are , they want to go up to the end of the interviewee .
just further . so much fun .
and so on .
thank you , but the best one comes .
so now i am a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who really are interested in art , can click here -- but i &apos;ll take it away .
so this is one of the images that we &apos;ve obtained with the so-called <unk> .
so this image for example has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to do for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can kind of <unk> and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want deep inside .
and so i started playing around it , and i realized that there is something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i was getting up close , and i started slowly slowly , that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little , i spoke a little bit with a couple of famous , and i actually found out that it &apos;s a game called a game called <unk> , where one would be hit with a stick with a stick .
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned something about it .
and to go close to really close , you can go to the foragers .
just to give you the <unk> , i turn out to see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one is still -- in a second .
so let &apos;s jump quickly at moma , back in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
at the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s only when you want to see van gogh <unk> ?
you <unk> in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite <unk> of this image , until i really did .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are still many other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part of it , it &apos;s not .
every one of them , every -- no matter whether rich or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and create your own museum in the museum -- from all these pictures you can use your own collection .
simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- they can <unk> .
this is the <unk> , the <unk> .
you can put anything to throw your friends to your friends , and so you start a conversation about what they &apos;re feeling when you &apos;re looking at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , i think , is the main thing that all the wonderful stuff here isn &apos;t google .
they don &apos;t come from the museums .
i don &apos;t want to say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re hoping that we &apos;re just going to live in the digital medium of art , and they &apos;re <unk> online .
it &apos;s the biggest question that recently asked me , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a football ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it wants to add the experience .
it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two .
that &apos;s the left half of half , which is the logical side , and then the right half of the right side is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could pose your brain .
for instance , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have , perhaps for one extremes , but i think that most people in the audience , you know , the brain is something that looks like that -- with a high amount of <unk> , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
they can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people involved with the most other experimental <unk> that takes a good value of logic to add complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a great deal of intuition to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love it with things .
so we go out and play it and look at it and look like it , and then we &apos;re going to start developing this intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the time they evolved over the years is probably a thing that can only be a place at the same time .
i mean , it may sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time at two different places , but they &apos;re not born with this idea , they &apos;re not born .
i remember to see a child playing playing a <unk> .
he was a toddler , and he &apos;s not very good at it , and he fell constantly .
but i &apos;ll bet that it was a very valuable lesson with the <unk> of a very valuable lesson , which is the big things you &apos;re not going to leave and stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so it &apos;s not a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re not playing with these little weird particles .
and if you &apos;re playing with their particles , they do all kinds of weird things -- like they &apos;re flying directly through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and we called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics just a couple of years ago ; you took quantum mechanics to describe these little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the large mundane objects around us .
it doesn &apos;t liked my intuition , and that maybe just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i haven &apos;t seen it .
i mean , nobody ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all of these things are made out of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , then not simply not to follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it should not be like this .
so i would feel better better with the whole thing , if we could kind of show , that <unk> is also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see these little <unk> dot there in the center .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
so here &apos;s what i &apos;m going . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal is shaped like a springboard and it stands above the edge .
so i made this thing in a way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> and <unk> for 100 hours of all these big devices .
so , for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to this sort of <unk> pool of hole and getting the thing .
this thing has this thing has to be the capacity to be <unk> in the <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m standing alone in the elevator , i &apos;ll do all sorts of weird things , but then other people &apos;s going to add up and i listen to all these kinds of things , because , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics tells us that inanimate objects are .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not just human beings , but also the light that looks at them , and the wind that is over to you and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is <unk> , we had to <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
so we turned the light off , put it into a vacuum , and <unk> all the air out and <unk> it until now , on the elevator , was the piece of metal free to behave like that .
so we measured its movement .
we realized that it &apos;s really weird .
instead of it , it &apos;s just quiet , <unk> it . the way it was <unk> , like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in that we give him a little push of it , we were able to vibrate at the same time , not to vibrate -- something which is just in the mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you about is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object at the same time , not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms that are there are still silent there , and at the same time , the same atoms move on and off .
just too precise , they agree with that .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
that means that every atom at the same time in two different places , which is that the entire piece is that the whole piece of metal in two different locations is .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the green space , because , you check that , the <unk> between one atom and this piece of metal is just like the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if you can be a single atom at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal in two different places can be , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is saying .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in several places , how would that feel that ?
how would you deal with that body &apos;s body ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal always was there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in reality , are just <unk> objects in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about how mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more more than that , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should think we should think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about how to live and work and work , you want to choose the opportunity between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition with new inhabitants .
right now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there &apos;s billions of people in the developing world that doesn &apos;t even have a single town to open up .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more value than it costs them .
so we could just <unk> the world very easy to <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
this may sound for you now , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
they &apos;re just going to do the construction of homes against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they did , but the other half , but not yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what they would like to be in their homes , in those homes and their environment to avoid avoiding and <unk> .
so it turns out , as a very hard , all of all these <unk> .
but you could go to a completely new place , building a fully new block of building , <unk> the laws that would support such a building and not healthy .
so i proposed that governments create new spaces that provide enough space for a city , and they have a name : <unk> cities .
later , i figured out later that , around the same time , <unk> and <unk> <unk> about the challenge of a reform of peace .
they knew that every year every year was about 75,000 <unk> to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their own country , and they can do exactly the same thing in <unk> .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , what if we just give them a message of the american embassy , and if you &apos;re going to work with the canadian rules , you can work with the <unk> rules , or the united states , can you work with the <unk> of the world .
in the summer of 2009 , cyclone jazeera was assassinated .
in the next half-century , elections , <unk> <unk> <unk> into a shift , whose program promised both innovations .
he proposed <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared a talk at tedglobal .
by improvement , testing , and through the research research , i &apos;ve tried to do this complicated concept of <unk> city city to reduce elements .
the first thing is , is the importance of laws , laws that determine you cannot be able to have existing <unk> .
we &apos;re giving new technologies a lot of attention , but for the progress , it requires the technologies and laws , and these are usually laws that <unk> us .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and again , it showed him <unk> .
the two <unk> me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s just present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december in the <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;m trying to make a clear how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are as they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , and remember that a area in some cases per year is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion at one point when there was a pause , <unk> , <unk> said , &quot; paul , could we have the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk made in very much more powerful shape that a <unk> city is a place , whose beginning is a <unk> country , which is the laws that govern there are the opportunity to choose either under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of <unk> , who meant that we need to make this project , that &apos;s important , and that &apos;s what &apos;s important to bring our country forward .
i was asked asked to come to <unk> , and i was at the fourth grade and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve given another talk with facts that have a graphics like this includes a graph that &apos;s trying to make a lot of value in a city , which is a very large city to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of <unk> , and the sketch represent the new airport that was built in <unk> .
at this airport , it &apos;s got an area of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of the city , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
<unk> have all <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and alert .
the head of congress came on the stage and he said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you for your talk , but maybe we might be looking at the tedtalk .
i have my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and you &apos;ve got the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line , a new city to give people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away from north .
and a new city includes new possibilities for executives .
the leaders of <unk> would rely on the aid of <unk> , they could benefit from their wallets , they could benefit from their wallets to the regime of this charter and in the implementation that everybody would have to rely on it .
and the lesson of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> that i thought was going to take as a way to build the foreign investment that could be <unk> for all parties in honduras for all of years of fear and mistrust .
we went into an area .
this is a picture of this place .
it weighs about thousands of miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , they voted in the constitution for a change in order to have a constructive policy that &apos;s <unk> for special <unk> .
in a country that &apos;s just a very violent crisis , in the congress , congress was elected to a vote for the <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
on january 17th , it was the second time with <unk> <unk> .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and february of february , went to about 30 to the two places of the world that were most interested in the business of the world , which is most interested in the business of the world .
the place is south .
this is a picture of a big new york city that &apos;s built in south korea built great as the urban center .
everything you can see on this picture , within four years , after four years , after it took for four years .
the other place that is very interested in urbanization is singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so , if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a <unk> ; and you think about this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that allows <unk> to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered its supreme court to the court of the <unk> calling the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
and also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually put funding into a donation .
one thing you already know has been understood , there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
there are many businesses who would like to enter in america , especially at a place with a <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live there .
over the world , there are 700 million people who say that they would like to live in a different place .
one million people out every year every year , latin america and migrate to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to do their families , and they leave their families , sometimes it &apos;s a single mothers who need enough money to make food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who are trying to find their parents back to some cases that they have no longer seen .
so what &apos;s it for an idea to start thinking about <unk> a whole new city ?
or even <unk> of these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition to make new inhabitants ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends of honor have asked me to say , thanks to ted .
do you know how many decisions you do on a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a poll with over 2,000 people , and the average number of choices , the <unk> of a typical american is <unk> .
and also recently , a study recently did with ceos in which they saw a week of the ceos .
and these scientists have simply documented the different topics , and how much time they have spent choices , and how much time they have spent choices with the issues .
and they found that an average ceo of the week in the week began with recurrent tasks .
each of these topics , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been hit within nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes in terms of the nine minutes ?
how good , do you think they &apos;re dealing with the decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
well , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask them a question , please raise your hand , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , if i ask you , if i ask them a question , and your answer is , well , my first question is : are you willing to hear anything about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at the stanford university , i went to this very , very little <unk> , at least at least , at least .
it was a store called the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of balloons and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we &apos;ve been actually <unk> .
i loved it to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how is it going to be , you know , well , what &apos;s you ever ?
here &apos;s the oil spill .
they had about 75 different kinds of oil oil spills , including those who were locked in boxes that came from thousands of years old .
so i decided to visit the leader of the head , and i asked the leader , &quot; works this model , that you really put these people together ? &quot;
and he pointed out the <unk> of tourists , who would come every day and they usually have their cameras .
we decided to take an experiment and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> directly at the entrance of the <unk> .
we have six different tastes to <unk> or 24 different tastes , and we looked at two things : first , i guess what would be more people who are going to stay ?
there are more people left if it were 24 , about 60 percent than if there were six percent , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people would buy a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
by people who stayed there as it were 24 , only three percent of actually actually bought a glass of glass .
and from the people who stayed there are six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do math , people bought six times a glass of <unk> who they had six times a glass of choice when they had 24 / choices .
now , if you don &apos;t choose to buy a glass of glass -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that the math also affects us very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even if it comes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is saving .
so i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m describing with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were making decisions for nearly one million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was the number of <unk> , which was possible one of the <unk> , the <unk> plan , which affects the likelihood of tomorrow , is going to be saving more tomorrow .
and what we found was that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> captains , which is something that people offered anything between two to the latest fund .
and what we found out was that the more fund was offered to be that , in fact , the education rate was low .
now , if you look at the extremes that plans that offered two , they had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that <unk> nearly 60 years , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re willing to participate in <unk> , if more options were , it &apos;s negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more likely to give them the more opportunities to give them the more , the more convinced they do it and <unk> .
the more opportunities are available to you , the more they put their money into pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , it belongs to the choices that someone would recommend if your future is important to the future of well-being .
well , in the last 10 years , we have seen three essential negative consequences that are conducive to the investment of more and more choices .
they &apos;re pushing the decision -- push them up , even when it comes against their own .
they make more worse decisions -- poorer cash and poorer medical decisions .
they choose a lot of things that they do less miserable , even if you make it objective better .
the main reason for this is that we might be able to enjoy these huge screens of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t move the comparison and we can actually move something out of the fantastic vote .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in various ways of <unk> -- that they can &apos;t apply to their business .
first : limited .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as much as today .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just let me . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , we &apos;re going to see it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be ready , and the brightest will get rid of it , and then there &apos;s a increase in sales , it will cost the cost of it , &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , as a <unk> and gamble , the different head of <unk> and <unk> types of <unk> , they experienced one increase in sales to 10 percent .
as the golden <unk> corporation of her 10 , <unk> <unk> , they &apos;d experienced that the revenues to <unk> 87 percent -- a result of the two , the increase of the sales and the cost of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is the <unk> supermarket in the world &apos;s local supermarket , and they &apos;re just allowed to give you conflicting products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the best examples that recently come to the market , it &apos;s the best way to <unk> the choices , was something that david <unk> has very strong <unk> , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered to harvard .
every single one of harvard people automatically takes into a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice , 20 dollars , not 300 and more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i want to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t <unk> them , it doesn &apos;t . &quot;
now before we &apos;ve been having lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was ready to take all the people in this audience to offer a <unk> on the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read them .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple seconds to read them , and then i ask them clapping , if you &apos;re willing to embrace gary .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to embrace gary .
are all that ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s what the first time you looked at first time was more information than the second time , but i would guess it &apos;s a real time that she felt more real time .
because the pictures made it for you .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between ways to understand how the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that the consequences must be characterized and felt that the consequences need to be vivid and secure .
why are people averaging about 15 to 30 percent more if they use a <unk> or a credit card than at cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and it turns out that if you synthesize it , it &apos;s a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save them more .
so we have a study that i made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- employees who worked all for <unk> -- and these people were all in a supportive of the time they were in participation .
and during this session , we &apos;ve got this session , as they always did , we have just added a little bit of an accident .
the little thing that we have in addition to <unk> was that we asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
so where we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation in response to 20 percent , and there was a increase of the number of people who were willing to save or a increase in four percent of the amount they were willing to pay for .
third technology : <unk> .
we can make more categories more categories than more choices .
so here &apos;s an example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s <unk> up in the <unk> up and down in the northeast , varies between <unk> different kinds of magazines to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 papers , and i &apos;m going to show you a little <unk> of <unk> , or these 20 categories , and you think that i give you more choices and give you a better loan , when i gave you the 400 of the 400 , when i gave you 600 .
because the <unk> tell me how i can keep them apart .
these are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the links is <unk> , and the ad on the right is the jazz , then they clap in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so on the left , jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> need to tell the <unk> something , not to give the choices .
and this is a problem , often , if you look at the long lists of all this fund .
who do you want to inform it ?
my fourth technology : i think of complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to move complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
so let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to give her a car full of self .
they need to make their own decisions to design their car completely .
now , these are the decisions in the number of choices that make them a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four ways .
so what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the choices .
half of the users will go from the many possibilities , <unk> <unk> <unk> , four gears .
the other half of the users are about the small possibilities , four gears , to the 56 , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how are you interested in .
if you can use the <unk> of the decision , that means that they &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find out is that the people who go from the very few to the low altitudes , and they will always choose the <unk> .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choice to the crowd , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is that the sequence is being presented with this information .
when i start with the very simple , i study how i &apos;m <unk> .
even though they choose the same hand , nothing to me about my preferences in <unk> , they prepare me to pick it up .
it <unk> me too well about the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to make me motivating myself with interest .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , which is the problem of <unk> <unk> -- -- will you get the <unk> alternatives , <unk> -- make it real ; we can make more <unk> , less possibilities , less possibilities .
each of these techniques that i describe to you today is to help you help the possibility -- good for them , you can use them for yourself , good for the people they provide .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re driving to the selection .
and the more we are <unk> when we &apos;re driving , the better we are going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i look at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then , therefore , this is important .
we all want to be <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so complicated hard .
but <unk> have enabled that we all have to be famous or all of our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous for the internet to the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours a minute uploaded a minute .
it &apos;s only going to be a tiny percentage of <unk> and thousands of times , and so the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> showed this video that he photographed before his house in the national park park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like the video last summer for first year .
actually don &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re just doing this , if you &apos;re a <unk> mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually sent to january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &apos; <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
rebecca <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;s one of the birth of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; the &quot; double <unk> , &quot; it seems like nothing .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other spikes are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , a lot of blogs started to write about this .
michael j. nelson <unk> was a first thing to have a joke that had a joke to twitter .
so what &apos;s important is that an individual individual or grouping of a group of <unk> is a different audience with a large audience and <unk> .
and then the community was formed by people who shared these big <unk> , and i started talking about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single day .
unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century , the part of the community is the part of our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by getting it or something new .
<unk> <unk> is animation and music in <unk> .
this is , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it for crazy , you &apos;d be able to know that there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cats are looking at this video .
cats are looking at cats that video video .
it &apos;s important to creativity that creativity is the <unk> and <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then there was international .
one of the <unk> fired from the floor that made it a silly joke to something that we could all participate in .
today , we &apos;re not just going to enjoy something .
who could have predicted all this ?
who would have &quot; double <unk> &quot; or turkish , or &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what <unk> would be done to write in these things ?
in a world , every minute two days of video is uploaded video , only unique and unexpected <unk> as the previous video .
i admit i was not very much interested in my friend , and i was supposed to look at this great video , about a guy who was protesting in new york to fight for the <unk> .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not in the <unk> , but often there is a disability that &apos;s not going to let you drive the <unk> on the <unk> .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey became <unk> <unk> , and his argument for five million times .
this approach is true of everything we do creative .
and that all leads to the big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access and in the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his start at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling of the <unk> of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and you &apos;re not paying attention to the media today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about 10 minutes about the rooftops between women talking about three generations , and how the amazing strength of that connected to the lives of a four-year-old girl girl , when she was about 30 years old , and her grandmother &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and her grandmother &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> in the life of this little girl .
the story is not over .
she &apos;s a game that is there .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning your life .
he is a poet , a writer , a man whose entire life of the simple hopes of unity and liberty of his family was held together .
hold it in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , how he has to admit that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , he <unk> his .
he went back to silence .
he died , broke through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me leave his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my assignment to learn that the story was trying to figure out the story , but it was about it .
so the next <unk> shows shows how a boat in the early <unk> silent <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a marriage marriage , already with two little girls .
for her , life was her assignment : the escape from her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat still on the lake , as <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear was in front of the rape and death and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little <unk> .
so , at one point of <unk> , my sister had only been my sister and i loved my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- this is continuous <unk> of the motor , the <unk> of each wave , the sheer and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , who came a lot of times , but they were <unk> by the <unk> of the men on our boat , or the engine of the motor , who didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights of <unk> off the coast coast of the coast coast , and at the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the flavor of the first <unk> <unk> that gave me one of the men .
no apple ever tasted this way .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations who build together a new life .
we went down to <unk> , one of the <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> were shared between people who had one thing in common : they started <unk> .
my mom was working on farms , then at one millimeter , six days , six days , twice the layers .
it was a kind of way to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every one dollar has been given , and it was given in another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do . mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
two pair points for school , each one to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because they had to reach six years .
and there was the rare , but it was painful , and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; 71 , go home . &quot;
after where ?
something <unk> itself .
there was a meeting meeting the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day and heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my assignment assignment to stay awake until her <unk> came , so i could <unk> them .
she opened a <unk> , and then it was a <unk> and a store .
and the women came with their stories about men who are not <unk> and angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looking for .
centers were built .
i was living in <unk> .
in one of one , i was the classic asian student student who introduced to himself .
in the other hand , i &apos;ve been involved in <unk> life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many got over the years .
and because of that aid , i was in my last year last year , as a young year of the year .
and i was going to <unk> from one another <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was <unk> le , refugee and social activist , who had been invited to be invited by places that she had never heard .
i &apos;m not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to be in the routine and the <unk> of the life of a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who <unk> every one of her days as 20 years , by the time she told each other day , and we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i said my mom , i wouldn &apos;t create it .
she reminded me that i was as old as she was at the time when we climbed the boat .
no wasn &apos;t an opportunity .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about <unk> and training , and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they were like , they were living on the limits of the possible .
and even though i had graduated , i realized i could not live with a career in law .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , a <unk> , and not just fine , but something you need to be grateful , perhaps a gift of <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easy to collapse the <unk> to the <unk> , so easily , you know the assumptions of the environment .
now , i went to know enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not like that .
possibilities that were not allowed to be <unk> .
there was a energy , an incurable optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my feeling .
and i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; the <unk> challenge . &quot;
a year we had no penny .
at the end of each day , i took a giant <unk> soup that we shared .
we worked too late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to move into the u.s.
after just a journey there .
my feeling again .
three months later i was moved , and i went to the adventure .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> , social norm and the local state , the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died after her birth .
her mother moved on her own .
with 17 , she became the second woman &apos;s second , whose mother beat her .
and without a support of man &apos;s husband , she was <unk> for a <unk> in trial and <unk> in her own case , and a few more <unk> , when she won .
&quot; don &apos;t be &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i was sitting in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at them on the other side .
i knew she was coming to sue .
my mom rang a few minutes after after .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> , and sat around her .
we told her stories , and we <unk> her .
and at midnight , the monk and said he would have to close the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand warm and the rest of her is cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s holding it tomorrow morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t stop . &quot;
if there &apos;s a bond in our family , it &apos;s going through women .
you see who we were and how life was shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives , we would have gone into the <unk> .
the defeat would be too easy .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still think about the boat .
who would ever be a wish ?
yeah , i was scared of <unk> before <unk> .
can i give you a bug in their lives , the courageous every wave <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the engine , the long horizon , who doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it could be safe , i would do it .
another is <unk> mother &apos;s day in the fourth grade or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it at all of photography ?
because of course , this is a picture that you can record with your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 years .
i combine it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera , in the process , was in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process of a camera ends up when you squeeze the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about to go to the right place to be at the right time .
i believed anyone could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins when the trigger is going on .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> road .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and still a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all the shared objective to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
because of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to make it look like that , as if you could have that , on a photograph .
pictures you need to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s a little bit more to capture an idea as a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes realistic appearance ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface space .
it &apos;s not about realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality that you can take different pieces and put together together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can identify with each other in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , they can create something which is still more three-dimensional than whether it could be .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really just make sense of it .
and i see the same process of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about to combine different realities .
so the things that make an image realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think of it , because otherwise they &apos;re just kind of false .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to be able to get a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
but combine something special like this .
so the first general rule is that they should have the same perspective .
secondly , putting together the same thing that have the same thing .
and these two images are <unk> these two demand -- out of the same height .
and thirdly , it &apos;s about to make it impossible to make it possible , where the individual images start and end up creating it seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to tell you how this photograph was actually composed .
so by looking color , contrast , contrast to the edge of the individual images , rigid clusters , like <unk> , auditory colors and disorders , we &apos;re <unk> the envelope between the various images and make them like a single photograph of planes .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is only a landscape of being in and the bottom section .
but this image is completely composed of pictures of different places .
personally , i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place , because you don &apos;t go to compromise , you don &apos;t have a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to plan that to find the different places of the jigsaw .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> <unk> .
the bank is from a different place .
it &apos;s a quarry <unk> .
and yes , i actually put the house up on the island of red , to make it <unk> .
to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s going to take me out of planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
this is about the combination of different images .
and this is a piece of very good planned .
and then if you make good shots , the result is pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so , these are all sorts of tools , and the only thing that &apos;s limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to talk to your patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced on the <unk> was a <unk> .
and i &apos;m not particularly a little bit of science -- you hire a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient , families , relatives , relatives , &quot; how are it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main issues , why everyone -- maybe just the most of the electronic <unk> fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> <unk> . a very simple thing .
she has a button . it has a button .
and every morning i turn on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you know .
i have my job with 95 lbs .
it &apos;s very simple : every time i jump on the scale , then you send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re going to be <unk> by my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and it &apos;s not just at the moment in which i need <unk> support for a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump into my <unk> and people already talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , you &apos;re just trying to <unk> a little salad . &quot;
but this is the <unk> of what &apos;s going to happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or patients , for patients .
but it could also be used to get people from their chair , and to bring them to some kind of play together in any game to control their health care better .
next week , this is the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> machine that you call an iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from your blood pressure to send him to their physician and share it with other people , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patient comes into the game , they can &apos;t just take control of control , <unk> on their own ship , but we can also help health care in the face of the challenges that we &apos;re facing , and the health care of health , twice .
they make techniques that are easy to use , and they start to hug patients in the team .
and that can be done by these sorts of ways , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe in our cell phones .
well , we know exactly where all the atm machines are around .
we still know one of the gas stations .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would be the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the nearest <unk> <unk> was in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we have a website , and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with you where he &apos;s , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed as closed , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> , already in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we &apos;ve created a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and somebody &apos;s collapsing , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can find your <unk> , you can save the next <unk> .
and from today , we don &apos;t just want to be as <unk> as the product is called , but as a result , it &apos;s as <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
and we asked our colleagues all over the world , at the other universities , to help us help us behave like <unk> to behave around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody &apos;s collapsing , it &apos;s your own <unk> or anyone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is is that companies around the world are helping us in <unk> of these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> still is still in his place .
and you can help them and try and try and improve the health , not just to make it happen .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to force that we &apos;re doing protecting the environment .
... it &apos;s <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s <unk> .
now -- we can just skip that -- i &apos;m going to just skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i launched a program to get the stars in technology and to take a year and work in an environment that is pretty much everything you really hate , we have them work .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little like the <unk> .
we choose some of the fellows , and we let them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and there were great apps they were working with urban employees .
but what you really do is show what &apos;s possible with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
here it looks like he looks after a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s <unk> him when it &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> feet .
how did he come to look at these particular kinds of help ?
we had a team in boston last year in boston with the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> .
and they realized that the city never <unk> these fire fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , and he was still something else , and that was the inhabitants of the sidewalks , right front of these parts .
so he did what any good engineers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you throw it to <unk> , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al gore .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic dynamic .
this is a very humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 applications that wrote the fellows last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other <unk> .
it &apos;s spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> town of the city of the city , who saw that he could use this app , not to the snow , but the citizens of the citizens were adopting .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to clean the citizens to clean <unk> .
and chicago , it &apos;s just introduced to the people who <unk> the <unk> when it was <unk> .
we know now nine cities that planning planning to exploit this app .
and she &apos;s <unk> distributed , of course , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that was working on a project last year in boston , for three people and two months .
it was about a way to figure out how to find out the right public schools for your children .
we were told later that if it was going on the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
now , there &apos;s a project in the california &apos;s central law that cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app which is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread from <unk> , is a kind of shot before the front of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access to access and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that they represent a new generation of the government , not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who are creating the tools that we need to do in common things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there &apos;s hundreds of people around the country that are getting up and <unk> every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give the government up .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about them .
and these guys know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all of your feelings about politics and the line of <unk> and all the other things that we really adore , is government , in the core words , in the core words , in the words of tim o <unk> .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you , you know , because things change .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in the change .
and because the government eventually got their power out of us -- <unk> yourself : &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government , when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought it was mainly about people to choose people in the office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s been around , mainly , to <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s what call calls for service and information .
you usually get out , if you &apos;re <unk> in your city .
if you ever have a chance to work in your <unk> center , as our fellow scott scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all -- you &apos;re going to see that people -- you will see that the people who calls the government for many different problems .
so scott gets these <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . it begins with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you open up all the doors in your house and see a lot loud music , and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . leaving applause for scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
in boston , boston has not just a call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very intelligent people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell you if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott went from man to person .
but the <unk> <unk> is all the public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next point we &apos;ve got , &quot; i went across , &quot; i went across , i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . come alive ? <unk> .
i turned on the page . went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to get into .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you would have to connect them with government services , but a neighbor is a <unk> , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper to fight services .
if a neighbor &apos;s neighbor helps , we &apos;re going to draw our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that &apos;s our contribution to the system .
how often we chose a political guide -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re expecting us back , and we expect that the government , our values and our needs , and then not ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top of the ocean .
and what lies below is what we call the bureaucracy .
and we &apos;re using this word with these sketches .
but it &apos;s kind of the sensations that we own , and we &apos;re going to be willing to be something that works against us , something different , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think of politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make the bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to engage the machinery of the government .
so the <unk> did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of formal citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is the answer to the <unk> on the <unk> .
this is not political being active , which is <unk> active .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you need to think the enormous challenges that you need to ask .
do we really believe that we need to reach what we need to do without improving the institution that &apos;s all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government is fundamental in a way that is actually able to get something to society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build things .
now , the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up to see her voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting the fight that we all fight , which is why they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can make your mind , every channel at every time , and they do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t worry so much about your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improves the job of the government .
and these apps are using our hands to improve our communities .
it could be , you know , a fire hydrant , <unk> <unk> , <unk> a trash with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have these <unk> <unk> all the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government who are paying taxes , pay equity .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re going to improve government , until we &apos;re going to improve the morals .
so the question i &apos;ve all here is : if it comes to the big , important things that we need to do , all together , will be just a lot of voices , or are we going to be a bunch of hands ?
thank you .
usually my matter is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are at the rise of being , and i thought , because i &apos;m here in my friends , i would tell you what i really think , and understand what &apos;s going on , with these incredible <unk> <unk> forward .
so i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... if you want to show the slide .
this is a slide that i chose from my yard folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather than the <unk> shape .
this slide shows data from the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of <unk> , compared to the performance of a change .
so what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , as many other others , which we often find in our field , a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is , every step in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty , we need to use this type of <unk> curves in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m talking about here .
so if you could turn the lights back .
a little bit tougher , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology to <unk> curves ?
the reason for that is , if i draw on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say this is the years , so the kind of times of a kind of a kind of technology , and this is an absence of technology that i want to show with a graph , then the graph is <unk> .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then it would come on a very <unk> scale , in shape of a flat line .
but if there &apos;s something like this , then this changes changes .
so as fast as fast as the <unk> of <unk> , we could get <unk> into a taxi in a taxi and 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
we &apos;ve never had this before the history of <unk> , this kind of exponential growth , by which the scale of the few years increases exponentially .
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to continue .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s been possible forever and <unk> as fast as it develops .
there are two ways .
either of you will be a classic <unk> like this , until something completely new , or it will happen .
this is about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really like this , then that means we &apos;re in a transition right now .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world in a new way of a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often myself myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new condition to take the world ?
because the transition transition is very , very confusing to be very confusing .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
more than we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future of the future is declining for me in the world .
i think the reason is that we remember that there is something going on .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a point of making 30 or 50 years into the future because everything is going to be so different , because it will make a simple flow of what we &apos;re doing now .
so i want to talk about what could be , this transition that we &apos;re currently in right now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk to you first about some other things that really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think about this really understanding , we need to take one step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and i want to look at this at the <unk> of the life of the earth .
i think the big picture makes sense if you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s a <unk> billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way of these chemicals , like these chemicals , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they <unk> the <unk> .
i think there are also theories that are starting to understand how it &apos;s done , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a simplified history of what is that time is that there &apos;s a little <unk> of this time that &apos;s different types of <unk> for chemicals .
some of these studies contain a particular combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
they were all the way they started .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> .
however , these <unk> are not about life in the world , because each one of them was just a little , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time it shared , these are the <unk> of these chemicals out of all the <unk> .
so every <unk> was a little bit different .
in fact , the knights templar , which is growing up for the growth of growth , faster than others , more and more and more chemicals from outside , and they divided themselves faster .
so this is the way that the longer we survive , and it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , when these <unk> is going to be learned about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , this <unk> is the ability to <unk> information .
they have learned to store the recipe for the cell as a information , and in a particular chemical shape , which we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to be , <unk> and <unk> them , so this information could be stored and copied .
and the astonishing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information over the time of a number of billions of years , where it was , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes that &apos;s exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every living organism is the exact same letter and the same code .
we are as far as we can only write the <unk> ourselves in this code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> that i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of <unk> .
in fact , what i &apos;ve made is , i took this code -- the code is made by normal letters that we use to use a piece of dna , and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it <unk> 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everyone to everyone in this room and even for everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of the dna was an interesting step .
and these cells , these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , a very interesting step , where things were completely different , and so they started to communicate these cells and share information from cells that were born of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
and that &apos;s why for example , that &apos;s the consistency of antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and they &apos;ve written this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate themselves .
now this communication allows for the reasons of communities that were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either have survived them , or they went together , and that meant that when a community had succeeded , all the individuals of the community were repeatedly repeatedly and <unk> by evolution .
the <unk> is now there , where these communities are so close that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of lots of <unk> <unk> , which together as individual organism is acting .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells , cells and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the level of evolution was happening , no longer the individual cell was , but the whole <unk> that we call organism .
so the next step was now , within these communities .
they started abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which made nothing different than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built these <unk> .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures that are responsible for learning to understand and capture information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning happened within the period of life &apos;s lifespan , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so , an organism could learn to eat a certain amount of fruit , because she was bad , and it was sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas these hundreds of thousands of years were needed , because this information had learned from the individuals that died of the individuals who died because those of these babies died .
so the nervous system is the <unk> system through this particular <unk> , because evolution could now take within a individual .
it could take place within a long time .
what happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> version is the human language .
but it &apos;s quite an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically giving a <unk> sounds of me , hoping to create a kind of <unk> idea in your head that has a kind of resemblance to a resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound , a sequence of sound , and creating something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a physical organism .
and what we &apos;ve actually done is we think of humanity &apos;s humanity .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that we &apos;ve gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , how we capture data .
so the invention of the language for example was a little step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on , are all the <unk> mechanisms that we built in our community to make this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we were .
so nowadays , evolution can happen in the span of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a <unk> little <unk> , where he showed a little evolution in the <unk> , right in front of your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again .
the first steps of the story i told you about , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , how language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- if something <unk> its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster changes it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that are feeding itself .
i live professionally professionally , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use using computers to build computer computers , not using the recent advances in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design for me to design these in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i &apos;m doing instead of doing , and what the designers of thinking about thinking is the designers of thinking about the machine , and the machine does that the machine , and the machine does make it more beyond that , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it &apos;s partly doing the techniques that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been used in recently is the evolution itself .
this is what we put in the machine in the machine that &apos;s going on inside the <unk> .
so to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s evolved from random instructions .
we &apos;re saying , &quot; computer , <unk> , <unk> <unk> random sequences of instructions .
now , please take all of these random instructions , all of the programs , all the programs , and then finally , the ones that are going on my best . &quot;
so in other words , i turn to what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to have a number of numbers that i &apos;ve been used to use .
so there &apos;s programs that can happen to be numbers .
so , of course , the chance of randomly chosen the very , very small , they &apos;re just going to be a number of the instructions , so they &apos;re not going to make the instructions in fact .
but one of those things might be very lucky two numbers into the right .
now , i &apos;m saying , &quot; computer , take the same 10 percent of the sequences that are going to come in the next .
store those up , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> <unk> that have the numbers of the best <unk> .
and this is a way of <unk> , analogous to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids <unk> the attributes of the <unk> of the two programs .
so now i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that were created by combinations of programs that come into a little bit of the trials than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> again .
you might have some mutations .
and try to do that another generation .
all of these generations require a few milliseconds .
and so i can make evolution over millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , or in some minor cases , a few hours ago .
and finally , i get programs that can be pretty much sort of perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s <unk> and weird programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that are done .
because their lives depended on it , whether they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , he <unk> a map of <unk> and says , &quot; oh , look . look at this .
there &apos;s this plane , this plane consists of <unk> <unk> , which together work together to make your flight safer . &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computer computing , which is a process that &apos;s different from classical engineering .
it allows us to do things with a lot more complexity than it would allow the usual methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the opportunities yet .
so <unk> <unk> technology &apos;s technology .
so we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to make these processes even faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s going faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies are feeding themselves .
we raise .
we &apos;re at a point where we &apos;ve evolved to have evolved as a symbol of <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t see what the hell are the hell we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think about something else .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of whatever whatever comes next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , two years ago , about two years ago .
i was under under the park in the desert with <unk> ali .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to go to california , we went to a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do that with airplanes .
at the time , when the big indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow to the floor and water .
now let &apos;s do that with <unk> and machines .
so we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i was a bit scared about technology .
it was frightened of me that i could lose the ability to be able to get the <unk> without the camera without tweet with my friends .
i felt that technology should be able to do this , not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and to pictures in my idea .
i was in front of this , when when we get rid of our fancy clocks and the cameras of dreaming .
they started being inspired by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling to connect readers to the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
this is always used to storytelling .
but what do we do ?
i &apos;m just going to be <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box ... &quot; i &apos;m writing my name . &quot;
and i &apos;ll get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows for gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
so the child in me is really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean to magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children had .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i was always quite exciting .
so you have to drop the ipad out of the ipad , and the smell <unk> .
and the light bulb passes through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can stick in a single <unk> .
and so there &apos;s a little book here , and every world is a little <unk> that i put here to the magic device in the device .
and this is opening a map .
<unk> had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and <unk> , and it serves the <unk> of the book .
it &apos;s also about other questions of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s also important to create something that is <unk> , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues know ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history of children .
a story that &apos;s in new issues like the <unk> .
on the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you &apos;ve got to go out and get out of the camera image pictures of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you need to go out to make a photograph of a flower &apos;s photo and tag .
in another chapter you need a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually sampled .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of making magic , to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction in the next book that you &apos;re using the video of the ipads and just see an animation that appear to appear on a plant in front of the house .
and in one spot , the screen will be with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , you remove the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of technology come into the technology and the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , jails or <unk> .
i spend most of my time in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there are plenty of hopelessness .
here at ted , to see , to hear and hear how powerful this is , i gave me a lot of force .
in the short time , there was one clear , ted has an identity .
you can tell things that have influence globally .
and sometimes when you get something about ted , it gets a meaning and force that it wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentation .
i think that we &apos;ve learned that the words of one person has meaning , but the words of one of a dedicated teachers are meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do a good job , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was dominated by a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had <unk> .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia than slave slaves .
she was born in 1880 and the experience of slavery in the world .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up with me and <unk> me .
she pushed me so much that i could barely breathe . and then she made me .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , he said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , let me calm down .
it was something that was something that was always going to be in her face .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins walked around .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and stare at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came over to me , and she took me over the hand , and she said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and me , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember this as though it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you need to promise you , you know , you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat me down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to watch you know . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise to me just three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first <unk> me , you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom &apos;s my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise to promise you &apos;re going to take you care . &quot;
so my mother , i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;re going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise is &quot; is you never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a half older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and he brought this <unk> beer with his sister and he went to me and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just <unk> around there .
then he took a quick beer and offered my sister of one another , and she took them , and then offered them one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . it &apos;s just not . i don &apos;t want beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do this , you know , you do whatever we do .
i had what , your sister had , you know , <unk> a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . do you just do . &quot; just power . &quot;
my brother look at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , <unk> . &quot;
and then he looked at the face and said , &quot; oh , no , you don &apos;t still do crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the grandchildren that are special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to admit something .
i should probably not do that .
this is perhaps <unk> publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;ve never got a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a <unk> . i say , because identity is power .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people to tell us things that they didn &apos;t think about .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re just special .
my grandfather was during prison in prison prison .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these issues were supposed to take care of .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
so , 1972 , 300,000 people in <unk> and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states is today the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are released on the room or with <unk> <unk> .
i think , in my mind , <unk> changes our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population of despair , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black black and 30 is in prison , in prison , or on the prison , or the <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , in baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black men in prison , in prison , in prison , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that has to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also <unk> .
we have a <unk> country that they treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor as poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , influences the result .
and yet we seem to be satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some <unk> developments .
my home in front of alabama would be permanent , if you &apos;re doomed .
and here today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population increases increases in their <unk> .
so we <unk> that in 10 years , the percentage of the <unk> of the civic cortex will be as high as before the <unk> of the <unk> .
silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that <unk> children to <unk> the prison in prison .
in this part of our country , there &apos;s been <unk> <unk> without <unk> .
we have a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we think because it taught us that the real question is : has a man deserves to die for him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : anybody deserves a crimes of death , but do we earned it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by accident .
so on nine people we &apos;ve gotten to <unk> one of the <unk> , one that we &apos;ve gone on for <unk> , who was <unk> and <unk> .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we &apos;d never let somebody fly on a plane , if for nine planes , you &apos;re going to jump .
but somehow , we &apos;re creating this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m <unk> my students <unk> . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , which time against the end of the world , until the beginning of the world war world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the african-american in this country , it was a time of terrorism .
in many places , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
and these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr , <unk> , they &apos;re talking about talks , they &apos;re saying they &apos;re supposed to stop the first time that they &apos;re supposed to stop in the history of our nation with terrorism .
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and the decades of <unk> <unk> <unk> and bloodshed .
and yet , there are a dynamics in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions did in the historical context .
we follow each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tension and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to do the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understand that the <unk> doesn &apos;t overcome the willingness without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , these willingness to be the willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve heard some of the talks about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly disturbing to hear you talk . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death .
and of course , it can never be there in germany . &quot;
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to do that we &apos;ve ever done again for the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously , and in particular people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like , in a world where the german state , the german state , <unk> <unk> , especially if there was a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re going to see people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted , 11 times higher , when the victim is black , when it &apos;s black , is 22 times higher , in the same states in the world .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities become <unk> , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to merge both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to make in a complex world .
for me , it &apos;s time to make time , thinking about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , who never be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to believe things we can &apos;t see .
we are doing that . so we &apos;re as rational as we estimate .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming from our heads .
they come out of ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s the <unk> that i believe is that it &apos;s not just open to us , not just for all the bright and <unk> things , but also the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe fighting the oppression , we wanted all sorts of things , but what we needed most of , is hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in <unk> places , sometimes to be <unk> .
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that they need to be engaged .
there &apos;s no way of technology and design that allows us to be very much , and as long as we can &apos;t be able to see the eyes and your ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want you to warn you . this kind of identity is much more than when we &apos;re not about it .
she &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink parks .
<unk> parks came back again after <unk> , where they <unk> two of their oldest friends , including these older women , <unk> <unk> , who had a incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white , whose husband <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women met , and they were just talking .
and then , a woman called <unk> me , and he said , &quot; <unk> , woman park comes into the city . we talk about .
do you want <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and listened to just .
it was always inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i sat there and listened to these women , and after a few hours turned around to me , and he said , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the ultimate role for the same is right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put on injustice .
people want to help people who were innocent convicted .
we want to fight bias and fight discrimination .
we want <unk> <unk> without any time to eradicate children .
we want to do something against the death .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and she looked at me and she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman woman <unk> himself , put a fingers on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you need to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i believe that the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to think of ways to make these challenges : these problems , this is sorry .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i learned a few simple things .
we are all more , as the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if someone is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , he &apos;s not just a burglar .
even who kills somebody &apos;s not just a killer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a basic dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although they &apos;re so dramatic , so inspiring and inspiring , we &apos;re not <unk> at the end of our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds .
ultimately , a society is not measured how they do their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to grasp the real amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of what we all .
sometimes these ideas are going ahead of our thinking , in very important way .
i <unk> these children who were very <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to go into <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and it &apos;s supposed to be an adult in court .
then i ask myself : how could that happen ?
how can a judge someone is into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long at night , and i thought , my god , if a judge could turn into something else , he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more well , i began to work on a fight .
i had a <unk> , poor young young boy as a client .
and i began to fight with this . the headline was , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black efforts like a privileged to treat white <unk> . &quot;
in my <unk> , i explained that failure of the <unk> and the police and <unk> .
there was a crazy line line about that country in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> .
and the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was doing this crazy <unk> , and i had written this crazy <unk> .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t just write it , but also sent to court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i got to the court and this crazy case .
i got in the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car , and i went upstairs to the court .
when i was the stairs to the court of the court , there was an elderly , black man who was in court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he goes into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , it gave me force .
it touched a little bit deep into me , identity , identity , the ability to contribute each one , to a sense of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , do you have this crazy fight ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people would come in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , that we were angry talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> <unk> , i looked at the <unk> .
he looked back through the window , and i could hear the whole <unk> .
he went up and down .
finally , this older man came with a very <unk> black man , and sat right behind me , almost in me , almost the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
and while the pause came in , a <unk> in the <unk> was felt that the job was in <unk> .
this <unk> ran across the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here to say this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i think many of you have figured out that many of you have figured out the moral workings of the universe , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we are not entirely designed as humans , unless we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that &apos;s our survival of survival with each other .
so that we have visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to take those of you who are just saying , just don &apos;t , don &apos;t stop the goal . don &apos;t give you .
you &apos;ve got this audience , this community , this community , and they heard them to help them do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> , where it &apos;s all about , actually , in fact , a effort to make a effort to do something , something from the <unk> of punishment in the <unk> .
here , california , for example , is going to be a billion dollars in the next five years , a billion dollars a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the <unk> doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> won &apos;t come before .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this is <unk> that &apos;s going to propose money in more <unk> and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the <unk> of america has declined major in america .
and this is a lot of the fact that &apos;s going to put in an arrangement with elevated prices .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really come in the class of <unk> .
it was <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic high pay pay for the prisoner .
so we &apos;ve upgraded the rhetoric of the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we have <unk> <unk> , which bring people to all over the time , for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft of good , rather than you force them , the things that give us the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people survive , not less .
and i think that our current don &apos;t help anyone do .
i think that &apos;s what we need to do .
<unk> , they really have a string of <unk> .
they &apos;re a inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin is a death of death is an increased <unk> .
2 : famine , three : o.c. <unk> , the police vessels .
four : malignant <unk> : dangerous <unk> .
six : social <unk> : 65 dead .
8 : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . tornado .
recession : gridlock . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects , because our minds are going to give up these topics .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second every day , every day , our senses can be much more information than our brain ever .
and because it &apos;s nothing more important than our survival is the first spacecraft to all the information that information is part of the information , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our system system , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> all the information around the search for any of the <unk> of risk in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s going to be very true .
well , with all of our digital devices that seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , 24 / 7 is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks the world is still worse .
but maybe it &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous amount of progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces that are made in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already been .
and as a human being , we &apos;re much better in terms of making problems in a very long way , but they ended up to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done , what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
over the last hundred years , the average lifespan is more than doubled , which is <unk> <unk> , the world &apos;s population has <unk> .
child mortality has grown a tenth rate .
and then comes the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs to be <unk> .
steve pinker showed us that we live in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles bonnet charles <unk> , the last 130 years had gone from 80 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
remember , a great percentage of americans who live under the line of poverty , access to electricity , water , <unk> , televisions , mobile phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , could never be able to dream like this .
the basis of a lot of these kinds of technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to information technology is going to be great jumps in the curve of moore &apos;s law , and it &apos;s doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs in your pocket about a million times less than a supercomputer is more than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law last year .
notice two things at this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is -- in good terms , war or peace , recession , the recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , making a <unk> computer .
she doesn &apos;t slow for any of our big problems .
also , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left , it &apos;s upward .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all the available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends will call &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors and networks , 3d <unk> , that enable you to incorporate the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> supercomputers ? &quot;
it was very big .
i went to <unk> the newspapers , and i was looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human opponents . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
so imagine that this artificial intelligence of intelligence would be given to each other owners .
four years ago , ray kurzweil kurzweil and i here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies to be focused on what these technologies can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students , businesses , products and services , within a decade , can influence the lives of billions of people .
think about it that a group of students can impact the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
now , we can now <unk> dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think about creating , i don &apos;t mean , i don &apos;t live a life full of luxury for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about <unk> goods to create goods .
but scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 1700s .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he invited the king of kinshasa to dinner dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> , however , got <unk> .
aluminum was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet , more frequently than gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome of the design was made of aluminum .
although , aluminum <unk> percent of the time is it &apos;s not a pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of <unk> developed and made it so cheap that we use it to use our <unk> .
so let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet with <unk> more energy than we &apos;re using a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all the <unk> minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce cost in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees .
the cost for solar energy fell in 50 percent .
last month , this is a study that shows that until the end of this decade , to the end of this decade in the u.s. at the u.s. , at the end of the u.s. , at 15 cents a national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;re going to have water .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> of 1990 , when it was <unk> in saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous picture . how did it be ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live in a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that has covered 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saline water , two percent of the water , and we struggle to fight for 0.5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s no hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> <unk> on the way .
and from a discussion today morning , dean <unk> , a minister of doing it , i want to share with you , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the <unk> , which many of you may have heard .
it can create thousands of gallons of clean drinking water per day of different sources -- if the water , polluted water , latrine -- and all that it is for less than two cents per gallon .
the head of coca-cola has just <unk> to launch a large <unk> with a hundred units in developing world .
and when everything runs well , and i &apos;m very confident , and then a few of the technologies will apply globally to apply to the whole planet .
this is <unk> innovation that exist today .
and we &apos;ve seen this as mobile phones .
oh my god , we &apos;re going to get to 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries by the end of 2013 .
just consider a <unk> cell with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , a better <unk> than president reagan was 25 years old .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton was 15 years ago .
they live in a world that &apos;s information and communication in <unk> , how no one ever would have ever imagined .
and it &apos;s still better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousands of dollars -- gps , <unk> and the photograph , all of the books and music , using technology , are literally <unk> and cheaper in their cell phone .
and the best part of this is probably expected to be the health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the <unk> to the so-called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> x prize &quot; <unk> .
so we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone way that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with internal intelligence , you can test your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team <unk> physicians .
so , imagine this device . right in a country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device was a <unk> or <unk> sequenced , it &apos;s not known , it &apos;s got the <unk> of the election , and prevents a pandemic before it burst .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we just have the <unk> .
and just by the way , the biggest contributor against a population population is a better upbringing and nutrition around the world .
in 2010 , we had two billion people living online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to move <unk> of two billion on 2020 .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard before , will join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are you desire ?
and instead of <unk> gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several <unk> dollars that are going to flow in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier , and they &apos;re going to be trained to be trained by the <unk> , and therefore they &apos;re going to use the opportunity to use 3d printers and <unk> and so much more productive .
so what can be three billion growing , healthy , intellectual , productive members of the world ?
how would it be with a set of new , never before <unk> .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever you are , a voice to pay attention to its attention and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people bring ?
how would it be with <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are motivated to extraordinary things , things that could create large companies and money in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some of you know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , how the protein will evolve .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so this has been a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was done by professors and on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who play the game online .
and it showed that nowadays , the human landscape is better than the best supercomputer .
and when those people came and looked at who &apos;s the best <unk> of the world , it was not a <unk> <unk> , and he was somebody in england , manchester , a woman who was working on the day of the <unk> in a <unk> and night at night .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to ask us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools using exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what needed to do .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need something to be a <unk> piece of a medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s a medical doctor , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been a long time in business as i could give it to give up a chunk of my own <unk> <unk> to enable you .
but before i get to the actual theme of my presentation , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re very close to the <unk> and moving to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon , and it turns out to be statistics and to make these great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the statistics i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 , when a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player is going to be safe at 10 .
this is called the ball that beat the ball , it &apos;s coming up , it &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball up to the first base , it &apos;s not going to happen in the security .
three out 10 .
you know how you call a puff-o-mat in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
so that &apos;s someone who &apos;s probably four four .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player who died during a <unk> season of 400 time .
so let &apos;s turn back to my world in medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit more likely to feel i talked about .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to become a <unk> cluster , which is <unk> 400 feet in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and you &apos;ve got a beloved person with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> to a <unk> whose <unk> is in 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s much better . it &apos;s in the <unk> branch .
and she &apos;s punching a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think about the <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , an <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or doctor should be .
what we &apos;re doing though is that every one of them , including me , including the world , are going to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one has to worry about the details of how to be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a <unk> student .
in high school , a <unk> <unk> said that brian <unk> was learning for a <unk> .
and it was also .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> at the nurses in the toronto , toronto , <unk> hospital .
i learned everything .
in my hometown , i learned the origins and the tail and the air , every branch of a branch of any artery , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i actually knew the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed up with <unk> <unk> .
and i left medical school with the impression that i knew everything , and at least as much as possible , or at least as much as possible as possible as possible as possible , that i was immune to the mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met a little printer .
i was <unk> at a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman printer , brought me to the clinic hospital .
at that point , i was the <unk> layer of service in the <unk> service .
and it was my assignment when the <unk> <unk> was looking for the <unk> of advice .
and feedback feedback to my <unk> .
i looked at my wife , and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , she made <unk> sound .
and when i <unk> her chest <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under heart failure .
this is a condition in the heart of the heart , instead of putting the whole blood down , and it &apos;s a part of the blood molecules in the lungs , and then filling these <unk> .
and that was no hard to diagnose .
i hired them and made me on the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call <unk> , water pills , so they <unk> the liquid .
and over a time and a half and a half hours , they started feeling better .
i feel fine .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home to talk to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t have to rely on what i was supposed to have , what would have been a call in my <unk> , so he would have a chance to make a sense of a sense .
and he knew she would have been able to <unk> additional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to make responsibility , so i would be able to make my patients &apos; helpful without having to contact with the patient .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home to home , i <unk> a little voice in my head trying to tell me , &quot; satan , not good idea . don &apos;t . &quot;
in fact , it was very clear to me , so i asked the nurse that i asked the nurse , which was a <unk> printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and i said , in the <unk> way , &quot; clear , i think it will go . &quot;
i remember it as it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and brought her home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my belly .
but i worked on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the ward , and i went to the parking lot of the car to go home with the car , when i did something else i didn &apos;t make .
i went through my way home my way home .
and there was another nurse sitting there , not the sister who had seen her wife , but another three words of mine , and these three words are terrified of most <unk> , most of the <unk> i know .
other people are terrified of these , but the <unk> is particularly particularly , because we &apos;re seeing the patient &apos;s patient .
three words : remember , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient &apos;s patient who would have thought ? &quot;
i asked the nurse <unk> .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she got at home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 , they took it back to the <unk> with a blood blood pressure in 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
she &apos;s barely breathing blue .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them at the <unk> .
i was shocked , and to the inner <unk> .
and i went through these kinds of rollercoaster , because she came to the <unk> and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days realized that she would never take again .
she had suffered a <unk> <unk> .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , she formed the <unk> .
on the day day , she <unk> her -- a woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you know , you never forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next two weeks i did , and i learned that the first time of the ignorance of shame that exist in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you don &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you know all the healthy shame , if you give a mystery of your best friend , although this one is on <unk> , and then you will get caught and get a terrible discussion of it , however , at the end of the very end of the time , you know that you will never make a mistake .
if you do <unk> , and we never make mistakes .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the food that i &apos;m talking about is the <unk> one in the <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that tells you , that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but it &apos;s not bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t at the point of my <unk> , he was very gentle .
he was talking about the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> the <unk> and i &apos;m sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why did i not ask the <unk> ? why am i going home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why am i left in medicine ?
but slowly it &apos;s got it .
i started feeling better .
and then a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds of the clouds and the sun , and i could tell myself , i can feel better .
and i was struck with me that if i was growing my efforts to perfection and never even <unk> a mistake that could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened .
two years later , i had service service in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 year-old guy with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of us , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he turned on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next year , and my <unk> asked me to talk to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out that he was a <unk> .
he had an potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not a <unk> infection , but it &apos;s caused by the top of the <unk> .
luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and <unk> a few days later .
and again , i went through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , made me free and went to work on the work until it happened again and again .
in a <unk> , i have two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of a lot , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients a night .
in two cases , i didn &apos;t stop at home , and there were no <unk> of their treatment .
i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the limb . when it was without <unk> , my colleague , my colleague , the patient &apos;s chief of the patient , called the <unk> , called the <unk> .
the other one was very diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> in order to <unk> him and i asked my colleagues to evaluate it also .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was a <unk> at the bottom of the lower sector , he phoned the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was very good .
both of the time <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistakes just happened in the first five years , what many of my colleagues say , but there &apos;s a total nonsense .
some of my favorite trial happened in the last five years .
alone , silence and no help .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not close to my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the silent voice to tell me what can &apos;t find my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they didn &apos;t make those same ?
if i was in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
now , when did you hear the last time of someone who talked about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you know , you know about any other doctor , but you can &apos;t hear somebody about your own <unk> .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and in order to ask your immediate help and tell you what i was telling you about , i would probably not be able to do the end of the second story , before they really would be uncomfortable with me , you know , somebody would go .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues knew that a <unk> in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , believe me , i would have trouble looking at trouble .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do that , and those who don &apos;t do that , and the <unk> <unk> , which with the bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction that is like antibodies that attack you .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones that make mistakes out of medicine , that will be safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my talk about 20 years of the medical journal and journalism , i have a personal medical trial for medical error and wrong treatments for me so much of my first article that i was going to learn from one of my first article for the toronto show of white , black <unk> , black art .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we work in a system where we &apos;re going to make mistakes in a day where one of 10 <unk> is either false or wrong , in the <unk> forever , and they &apos;re always going to be more and the devastation or dead .
in this state , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute for medicine is the number of 100,000 .
both are powerful <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and is the <unk> .
in a <unk> where medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t compete .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own an cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a patient .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and <unk> and give it a slightly light breath , and suddenly the story of contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are no cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all these are actually <unk> mistakes .
so if you take the system , as i was taught it &apos;s been taught , and all the <unk> <unk> , then at the end of nowhere .
and you know the <unk> about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each other from the <unk> to the <unk> , saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot;
and then you &apos;re looking at your lens , they &apos;re just going to look down and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re starting to tell her stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you get to do .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physician .
the newly <unk> doctor is a person , knowing his humanity , pay them to make mistakes , but it lets you learn something from you to learn so that it can be passed .
she shares her experiences with other experiences .
they supported to talk to others from their mistakes .
and she shows other their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , supportive , the way all of the benefit is .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system together and if that &apos;s , you know , people are even mistakes at time .
so that &apos;s how the system evolved to create <unk> , which makes it easier to make sense of the people that are inevitably inevitably inevitably to make , to create the <unk> spaces in which anyone who are watching the health of health care , even more things like me to make the mistakes that are supposed to make it .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best , to learn it &apos;s other .
i don &apos;t know what they hold me , but i can live .
let me wrap up with three words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can tell this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , you know , he was <unk> here .
you may think that he was <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a <unk> .
until the 1980s , it was <unk> in a great scale .
now he stands for the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard a lot of times many times from the galapagos or elsewhere , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still go to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> described them still as pristine .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept that shows <unk> .
because i experienced it as i was in 1971 a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a nasty <unk> and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really get out of it .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon from <unk> and some pair of mangroves .
there was <unk> <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the fishers lived well , they were doing good good at ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish went down to half its height .
four hundred feet , they use five centimeters .
they were genetically engineered .
they were still fish .
people were always happy .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
so it &apos;s not changing , and yet it has changed everything .
now my third story is about my favorite story of mine at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more early in the &apos; 60s -- <unk> europe , <unk> europe .
<unk> <unk> countries that were already <unk> 100,000 of the industrial ship that was quite ugly .
i was driving this , and we made it all the southern tropical sea , and particularly in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know it was the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the cause of the sea of the sea , and then became <unk> .
these images are exceptional , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , one of the time you get a survey , and then starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is that it &apos;s going to change -- in this case -- a hard reason , or soft corals will shake dung .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she was not <unk> .
they want to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , that mountain range will have collapsed every time of fishers , if you &apos;re driving in areas where it &apos;s never been <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our new level of new level , and we don &apos;t think about what was there .
if you <unk> it , what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green in their country , the <unk> .
and the time is changing . it changes , because for people , their actions are very , very naturally .
every generation looked at the images that they &apos;re at the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and everything .
the difference is , what &apos;s a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give you a sequence of changes .
and at the end , you just want to get the <unk> remains .
right now , that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that disappeared , or things that are not more like they were .
now , you could think that the problem was a lot of people who were in <unk> societies , and they were killing animals , and they were just being aware after a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , an animal that was very common , it was rare before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not as much loss .
and the time we focus on the big animals and the sea is the big fish .
they &apos;re more rare because we catch them .
at the time , little fish left up and we think this is the <unk> .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people will say , scientists , saying it was really different .
they &apos;re going to tell it , because the evidence , as they &apos;re in a previous shape , are not as much as you would like to describe the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a <unk> project that could be observed in this area that can &apos;t be used , or not by <unk> , because it &apos;s not <unk> .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t dare to dare the sources of the past .
this shows the very large role that can play a reserve .
because through marine trials , we &apos;re basically asking the past .
we &apos;re going to ask the past that people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> changes , and they &apos;re very low .
so the people who can see the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be able to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who &apos;s not possible because they don &apos;t have access to the people -- people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think , i think the arts and the film might fill the gap , and the simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> are remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about the avatar , if you think about why people are being touched by why people were being touched by -- apart from the <unk> , why were they touched ?
because it was something that was lost in a certain way .
so my idea , the only one that i &apos;m going to give , is cameron of cameron , so it &apos;s <unk> .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , you had to acknowledge if you had a typewriter , you had to register it .
they also had a leaf called <unk> <unk> .
the reason this is : the government was able to do where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , she could find the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , like anyone could do something like this , and how much that would be the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , 2011 , a new <unk> of the leading machine shop and print a page , then this page light colors on every page , into a pattern that <unk> the site , into a pattern that is clear to her .
that &apos;s what happens .
and it doesn &apos;t seem <unk> .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three types of <unk> that &apos;s existing existing .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s happening in the world , we can divide the attacks of categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several cases of <unk> cases of <unk> , <unk> that money by attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on .
these guys have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve been illegal , so they used <unk> to <unk> money from our <unk> , while we &apos;re not going to do our <unk> , or <unk> our <unk> , or <unk> , which is a infected computer .
the american intelligence agency <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and on this account , <unk> million dollars a million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. <unk> himself is <unk> foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m going to argue that this is more likely to be the victim of a <unk> than an <unk> in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just getting worse .
in the future , most crimes are going online .
the second second we can see today is not motivated by cash .
they &apos;re sort of motivated by something else -- <unk> , an opinion , or through her audience .
groups like anonymous are moving over the last 12 months , and they turned to one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are working in the money because they &apos;re <unk> like anonymous , but the last group are nation , and the last group of nations who lead the attacks .
there are cases of <unk> .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last autumn , it had to be <unk> , because giuliani was hacked .
somebody was used and had the system <unk> .
and last week in a meeting meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior members of this group , whether it &apos;s possible to possible that because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row of these things ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , if you had a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for example .
now we all use , or many of us , or many of us , or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly widely distributed in <unk> states like <unk> , because they can &apos;t trust that much more of the local government , so you know , the local government can &apos;t trust themselves .
but if you can , you know , in a foreign foreign ?
<unk> <unk> + <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
how does it compare to the arab spring and things that happened in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the rebellion in april of 2011 , the headquarters in april of egyptian <unk> , and they did a lot of records .
in this files , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes from one in germany , the egyptian company , the egyptian government had sold a few programs , which they were -- in very large framework -- all the communication of egyptian citizens could capture .
they had this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so governments governments governments governments with <unk> governments with <unk> , so that &apos;s what against their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago , a few weeks ago , this was a <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to <unk> her own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s pretty much safety your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet on .
they use devices like the <unk> to <unk> your computer with a <unk> <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , <unk> your <unk> .
so if we think about these things , then the obvious response of people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t exist because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , 2011 , our governments may be trust , but every law we &apos;re going to be , forever .
and trust us , we trust that we &apos;re blind to one future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem weird , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made of <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they gave us to build things that were larger than we were , building bridges , a stone .
essentially , the <unk> was the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego lego .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> . &quot;
and within a few years , lego , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced , or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t need to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego lego made it possible .
lego lego is basically the <unk> of the world in the world , took a block of a building block .
in the same year , in the same year at the bell labs , the next revolution announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> of a world that was <unk> us from a world of static building blocks to a world that was interactive .
like the <unk> , a transistor allows us to build much more and more complex space , a stone .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea , how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> is electronic <unk> , who have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t sit it wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is <unk> , blue is flowing , pink is wires and orange .
so anything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build them very quickly <unk> .
you add a blue one in a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between them , and so they made a little <unk> .
take the switch out there to be a <unk> device that is here , and they made a little <unk> .
put these <unk> on an extra effect , and they made a <unk> .
i will stop that .
beyond the simple play , <unk> is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to program , or <unk> , or <unk> , allows you to use simple , intuitive gestures .
so in order to slow down the opposite or slow down , it &apos;s just a button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want every single interaction in the world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> in children and you see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how they start to understand the electronics that surround them in the world , and they &apos;re not in school .
like , for example , a <unk> device works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we also have <unk> <unk> .
so , for example , designers with no experience in electronic things that started to play with more than material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we gave risd <unk> and gave them some designers that had no more technical experience -- just packed , wood and paper , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh , which is fear in the darkness .
for these <unk> , it &apos;s got another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so <unk> is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> and you &apos;re making yourself .
we want the world the creators , the inventor , the <unk> , to encourage the world that we live in , the interactive world , we heard this interactive world .
so , pull them up and start to invent .
thank you .
