and before you don &apos;t have children , you won &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people discover some time in adulthood , &quot; community . &quot;
it always takes time .
real guilt is just a <unk> versus one person , and someone with down syndrome is not a person . &quot;
it &apos;s not a long thing to do with people .

this lady here is actually a particularly <unk> face , and both sides are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s <unk> light on this thing , so it gets a <unk> object , even though it &apos;s silent -- just how brilliant it is -- just how brilliant it is through the reflection .

but how do we take all this ?
we &apos;ve reached the 10 cents a page if we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what the <unk> is exactly .

and it &apos;s just hard .
so these are really hugely a lot of bees , and this is very significant .
so that means where beekeepers can replace their dead people very well , and they could keep the loss of losses .

first of all , we developed a little experiment that we gave people legos and they asked them to build something .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new , and while you have this <unk> , we have the other thing that they had built , apart apart .
there was a very beautiful relationship between love to lego and the number of legos .

and all of the radical <unk> production of production , and the giant <unk> of the e. coli that i &apos;m talking about -- look at the time you &apos;re looking at the time -- that &apos;s <unk> life .
so the challenge is full force .
the question is : why ?
do you think the african union is going to organize a conference like this ?
there are some things you need to know .
the speaker who was sitting here on the stage , <unk> muhammad , <unk> , <unk> that we had <unk> leaders in africa .
by doing it by their <unk> people .
traditionally , africans hate governments -- they hate <unk> .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get the government from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , <unk> boat .
something that would all relate to each other .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for <unk> filter , these personalized filters , is that she &apos;s going to be the balance over , because they &apos;re going to take off what you click at first .
it &apos;s supposed to <unk> to new ideas and some new people and strangers .
and the man replied , &quot; absolutely beautiful , what ? &quot;
i know that they &apos;re waiting for other bad <unk> -- i &apos;m just making fun -- but now i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of a quick math and then i &apos;ll show you new materials about possible solutions .
to the <unk> in may , it will give you an update on version 2.0 , where you can take it directly to the purchase of <unk> .
again , all republican here : it shouldn &apos;t be about <unk> .
what really excites me about the people in the gulf is that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and there &apos;s no no one , except for a few people trying to use the beach .
we &apos;ve heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this is <unk> across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor , they skyrocketed .
what the <unk> of the birds is , i don &apos;t want to make a <unk> remarks about people who clean .
okay , people who are in the <unk> , if you really wanted to be really conservative and really <unk> , you should send them to <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
okay , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i haven &apos;t asked you to <unk> it because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule molecule that we know as a brain .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human being .
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they are losing old branches .
and we can even talk about <unk> .
if you look at that number , you can easily get a little bit of the time that there &apos;s a big potential for <unk> in the brain .
potentially , this technology is going to be able to make us know of ourselves through each other and build our own brains .
he &apos;s mainly working on music videos and ads with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment to show you that .
ks : no , not yet .
while he did , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this happen : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge amount of waste for a few weeks .
but he still did .
so , his farm is incredible .
then he found this wild plant , the <unk> plant .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally got to try to try to try and try .
no salt , no <unk> , no oil , no spices .
what &apos;s the hell of hell ?
at least , i &apos;m supposed to think about it .
farmers who depend on nature to find solutions to find answers instead of nature solutions .
and from old to new fire to new fire , to change two great stories about oil and electricity , both of the two thirds of the fossil services in the air .
our fuel for mobility goes to three fifth grade cars .
you can make it quiet : it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use 1,000 hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
even better light and <unk> and then reduce the <unk> around a third .
in about 20 <unk> , private vehicles are <unk> cheap solar cells without cash , and lower their <unk> .
and what we &apos;re going to replace it is that it &apos;s going to cost about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we buy more of what we have or new nuclear nuclear power , or renewable nuclear power , or renewable .
so , at the results , and not incentives , to concentrate , can be <unk> and conflict with the <unk> solution of america .
and then i realized later that what i ate , two <unk> of his family .
and this simple <unk> shows that donors are in areas where the least kids are going to school , not schools . so this makes new questions .
two years ago , on october of 2010 , 2010 , i phoned my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
and we remember , and we &apos;re going to look at this in every book of my favorite son , that life four billion years ago -- four billion a second ?
so similarly , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are threats , there &apos;s a trap . a trap .
you have time to think of time , you have time to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , back .
they all come from families in which usually one person is at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure .
we put them to the right and the left to turn , so you know , they can follow their minds and the consequences of the consequences , they know orders .
let everybody go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for <unk> .
then you can support . that &apos;s the job of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
they can listen to listen .
let &apos;s take the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , you think of the content on the content , and at the end , you have the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there &apos;s a lot of people who have the same dream .
a website was created .
there were no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what &apos;s happening there is an incredibly complex process .
we can think of it as a loud language of our own language , but not the alien languages .
we tracked that by the american babies who had never heard a second language , at the beginning of the general phase of mandarin .
it looks like a <unk> <unk> from mars .
science on the one hand has a very rational approach to its surroundings , while art has a emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a <unk> over here to show you this .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the rags were <unk> by a little girl whose body was burned down .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose to compassion ?
the wound from the maggots .
suppose you like <unk> squares , and honestly , who don &apos;t like it ?
so we start with a <unk> , and then we put another <unk> off .
then there was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i said , &quot; it &apos;s a long dead .
&quot; i have a <unk> ! ? &quot; &quot; i haven &apos;t got a memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby , and i saw this fabulous guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said : this magic , magic is the only thing i want .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how intimately terrorism with our everyday lives .
at the time , when i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that their life was not about ideology and politics , but of economic pressures .
i think a lot of people thought even for a little <unk> .
but mostly it went to serious <unk> with the organized crime .
this money became <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- in bar , understands .
no one wants the <unk> to control their behavior and their <unk> with clients .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; wait a minute . she doesn &apos;t necessarily look like a <unk> .
clear , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t realize was that it &apos;s an definition of being extremely uncomfortable to leave his <unk> .
and since i really learned that , the greater the challenge , the greater sense of performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic is big , but the pacific is really big .
but it wasn &apos;t without <unk> .
it &apos;s a little green disk on the horizon , which makes them very nervous because of the rising seas .
we can start to meet better , more competent decisions .
<unk> <unk> : why i go across the pacific
this is the world trade <unk> on the front page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
it doesn &apos;t look at cost . it doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make that .
and ultimately , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s because they &apos;re feeling good at places that they haven &apos;t felt before .
and that &apos;s hard , if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , how can it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not that hard , somebody <unk> , and one day at school i said , &quot; oh , can you get my homework <unk> , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers to the night .
and we both put them in the back benches in class , so we were not <unk> .
maybe you &apos;ve got your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never it tells you , because how can you tell yourself if all around you ?
this is a french science .
all right , then .
if you look at these trucks , it &apos;s the largest truck on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s the reason why canada is now the number three is in relation to <unk> per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing .
by doing that , we remove a large part of our biggest <unk> and replacing it with most greenhouse gasses , and we then replacing the future of greenhouse gases in the future .
the <unk> of her work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead . it &apos;s a ritual that &apos;s tightly related to the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw was born in <unk> in <unk> and training in london .
i hope to convince you that complex and complicated is not always the same .
the <unk> <unk> is the one that we want -- the public support for the government .
so i proposed in my first tedtalk that we should spend as planet 21 billion hours a week .
only 30 minutes <unk> a day on a major improvement in mood of mood and <unk> increase of joy .
why a game ?
how could a <unk> play so much a giant effect in the way , sometimes <unk> situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience that are contributing to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically <unk> things that you can do every day to build this resilience , you don &apos;t need a trauma .
by more exercise , they will be empowered .
there &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake somebody &apos;s hand for six seconds , then the <unk> will increase in her blood pressure , the <unk> .
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and we &apos;re doing this together , actually thousands of people involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
and then a few people came out of chicago and said , &quot; the end of 2007 is the theme of the sea , global warming , global warming , and we &apos;d like to fill a chicago square square meter of gallery and we want them to fill her in her reef . &quot;
<unk> and <unk> are not just two concepts that fit good .
<unk> asked : &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
so , infinite . they &apos;re <unk> . very exactly .
so , so we have <unk> , by <unk> , the proof that the most famous minister of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual beliefs , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> property -- the self-confidence -- is my opinion , according to the holy grail of neuroscience , the neuroscience , and someday we will hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise in <unk> understood and intelligent , but when he sees his mom , his delusion , and he says it &apos;s not his mom .
so if this area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and <unk> -- nothing happens , just like regular people . if i &apos;m going to show him a picture of his mom , the <unk> activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a powerful , <unk> experience .
you might be able to get the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i had no arm , and therefore no more <unk> in the elbow , no spasm , no <unk> in <unk> . all my pain are gone .
<unk> is blue , <unk> is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is ?
it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , which most of us don &apos;t deal with .
this is kanzi .
none of the things that you &apos;re going to see in this video are <unk> .
well done .
he has learned that when he <unk> the same hands , with his <unk> <unk> , much larger and can make a much larger and <unk> <unk> .
a framework is a shack in the woods .
does he look at where the sound is ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars are dying in spectacular explosions that are going to leave .
on the right hand , gravity is the gravity . einstein has explained .
and beyond that , it makes new species of change .
it was still too early , but he was a moral guide , an inspiration for scientists who were concerned about the control of the guns .
let &apos;s take place , alien , alien creatures would have seen our <unk> at the cosmos , and not only for 40 years , but all the four billion years of history .
martin <unk> : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s going to be worse , &quot; then i would make a picture of it and a dozen <unk> .
well , these are undergraduates , so they gave a lot of money for things like <unk> and make-up .
and then we asked them how happy they are .
but it &apos;s a lot of different incentives .
these are <unk> in belgium .
so the teams , which we gave money to spend each other , were born to other teams and <unk> the league .
if we hear today from the <unk> , the high <unk> , we often think that this is still one of this <unk> conflict of the middle east , whose roots are as old as the region itself .
ironically , this was at a time when the invasion of iran was involved in washington , not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that is based on what &apos;s going to require diplomacy . is the diplomacy of the diplomacy , is war .
you can look for certain <unk> or you can look at the different regions , and compare them .
the map of port <unk> at the end of 2009 was not as good as you could have heard , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is this .
and the explanation she said , &quot; he was no environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , even the status quo and the status quo .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can do nothing . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , to the republic , to the african .
for instance , some people are in this room thanks to sputnik .
this is the case on my pen . &quot;
everybody &apos;s only slightly <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law is not true , it &apos;s true .
here you see the attack of the <unk> .
if you see in north america , the way that many things are active in the u.s. , they ignore each other . they ignore each other .
each of their <unk> depends on this critical region , the <unk> , who &apos;s about 10,000 independent cells , which is any <unk> rhythm -- a very high <unk> rhythm -- a very high tension -- a low tension -- a low -- a low -- a <unk> .
they were a little bit of sync in sync , but then apart .
so i want to show you a couple of interviews with people who were going to put on the bridge and describe what happened .
now you don &apos;t think you &apos;re not going to be a metronome , but we all walk -- and we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
am : this weighs just a couple of tons , so you &apos;re pretty fast .
but the <unk> scientist in his field .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told them , you should tell them your name , your <unk> , or the <unk> her mom .
and also , maybe this <unk> may have a <unk> that &apos;s not worth economic economically , an resilience , or pests or another property that &apos;s useful for climate change is useful , and the others don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids in tv .
the idea with svalbard was cold , so you &apos;ve got natural temperatures under the <unk> temperatures .
and if anything happens , they can come and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your position ! this is not right .
maybe one woman , a lady ? thank you very much .
you &apos;ve only tried two concepts -- two in the u.s. , and one in the russians .
insane . i &apos;ve got to talk about innovation cycles -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced with something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it gets rid of it , because i don &apos;t want the competition to come on .
i mean something really interesting this is going to happen .
ok , let &apos;s talk about a little bit of the commercial development of space space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has an epiphany .
and institutions will be &quot; naked , &quot; and if you &apos;re naked , the consequences has .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is <unk> .
the translation is from the <unk> .
you know , bees and fish in <unk> live .
all around us , a medical revolution , a revolution that will help us to defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , including <unk> .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of blood vessel is going away .
but the real question is : how good work works in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> device . it prevents angiogenesis in a very effective way .
but more interestingly , the study comes out of the study that the men have evolved , so that &apos;s what the more tomato sauce is , in fact , less blood vessels that feed their cancers .
albert von <unk> once said that , &quot; discoveries consists of what you &apos;ve seen , and think about what nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> at discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike ordinary problems that are honest with no very good puzzles .
one is the back of the other .
you may not be able to physically do it , but on a computer , it &apos;s going to work over .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction are going to fall here ?
so there &apos;s games like the brain to <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl is so powerful that we all needed to train not to be .
i remember , as an example , my father was very , very violent , to me .
we &apos;re so used to incorporate girls of being able to be <unk> of their own lives that we actually made , actually made them objects and they turned into it .
and she looked in the eyes of her baby and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , she was a ritual where she was girls who are <unk> , with their families .
and i will be in your side of your life on your side . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take the stuff .
why should they want me <unk> , <unk> ?
so , in the actual process , all six of the six teenagers are out of and <unk> the <unk> that made them through the photo array .
but the incident came in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , at 7 a.m.
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example show -- what is important to us ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and i was traveling a year through africa , where i asked people , why they built fractals , which is a great job .
and that implies in some villages up to the lowest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i was living in the jungle , i would just use a long <unk> , because it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s very cheap .
now , odd odd .
we have a <unk> in ghana .
the bad news is .
instead of turn to friends or relatives , they looked at david &apos;s work .
today , <unk> development is applied to a hundred countries and goes up to the <unk> .
the fear of losing wire . beds .
we put some rules on and hold on them .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
right now , when i <unk> tonight to come here , one of my daughters began to <unk> one .
and we developed 10 .
i was a teenager , when i first read &quot; anna <unk> &quot; and the famous sentence i read , &quot; all happy families .
and i want to show you how something you can do is to look like this .
if i split this water into the water , you see a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> is the <unk> that keeps the water away from the <unk> .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but it was successful .
one thing i want to be clear is that not all the <unk> wear <unk> .
we can <unk> them or turn them up or <unk> .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it to the circuits in terms of depression .
we are able to grasp what these circuits are and what the brain areas for the clinical ingredient and symptoms of these diseases are responsible .
evolution works in reality rather than an engineer as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough .
what we &apos;ve discovered is , if you look at the leg of a human being , like richard , or a <unk> or a crab or a crab , the relative <unk> of this feather is equal to everybody we &apos;ve seen .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s an amazing student , and they couldn &apos;t tell it .
he does this with a <unk> glue .
what we &apos;re doing is we take the hair as a model model , and put together together with another colleague of berkeley .
it showed that from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , two thirds of the <unk> men have children but only one-third of the women women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> and flew at this conference .
and we go out at the end , looking at us and say , &quot; what ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous trial of harvard business school school called heidi <unk> .
and i got my hand back , and i noticed that all the other women , and then you &apos;ve got more questions , just by men .
a woman approached me on this , and i looked at her -- she looked something .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as much as they should , but they do .
so not fear was the <unk> factor .
but it meets the black black .
so i want to talk to talk about how we &apos;re going to spread in this country , how we get information about information .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re in <unk> , <unk> language . and this works .
we tell them that everything is fine ; they &apos;re good .
so the patient is about 50 , so we can quite tell exactly how big its risk is to get prostate cancer .
you don &apos;t need the level of the audience in this room .
and this bee had to be assumed , &quot; i &apos;m sorry to these <unk> , these blossom , i get to the nectar , and i get off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , which is as a writer my favorite subject , how is the idea of the <unk> ?
all right , we &apos;re all equally <unk> .
the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : pretty fresh , in a <unk> bottle , even i could <unk> a <unk> <unk> in 15 minutes in 15 minutes .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass is going to be on these <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be something interesting .
and now i &apos;m saying that i want to make a layer of games on top of the world , but it &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already happening .
if you don &apos;t , it &apos;s a bad thing . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come at a certain time , you get your drinks to half a prize .
and then they can really do good in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a vibrant dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we talked the last time many years ago .
you can also see that i turn around this -- hopefully i don &apos;t shave the world .
you can see , here &apos;s how it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who &apos;s actually supposed to teach students to teach the law of the <unk> , just as a hobby , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place to work where it &apos;s fun .
and so this is something that we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who excited excited about it and crazy enough that they work on it .
thank you .
what brunel , as he said , he wanted to reach for his passengers was the experience of the landscape .
what makes life easier , more pleasant ?
in part , they <unk> this way , instead of making a great new device , the basement used to use one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of the time is <unk> <unk> , and they become part of the present problem .
and what we can do is we can make a difference in systems that have a bigger effect .
from my romantic surprise , the waiter with his boss .
mark <unk> and i &apos;ve tried to try and answer exactly that question .
but it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demanded .
but for the <unk> , <unk> availability of all these <unk> on the marketplace like a <unk> .
the americans themselves discover that prevents forever seem more attractive to the theory than practice .
<unk> parents would say more things like , &quot; noah was just for so short , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very fancy <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re <unk> problems that are controlled by nature .
so ... thank you .
it &apos;s to replace competition with cooperation .
and then we &apos;re building a <unk> that we can test the <unk> of the machines , and we &apos;re able to test very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the <unk> is not going to be understood as a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the <unk> enter the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear power station would provide the energy to the rest of los angeles .
then you take it , and you put it on the screen of your television , and you &apos;re <unk> from the screen , right ?
if you replace the word , if you replace the internet on the internet , it &apos;s very real , that its attitude is now very <unk> . let &apos;s hear in it .
i think it was that exchange that led to the consequences .
ph : i hope you can grasp it .
ultimately , the race race to make the future , as the phone company <unk> .
mm : because the audience has a role to do something .
they &apos;re making things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television is built , what &apos;s built , is a very exciting new type of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking to see it .
this is an spanish architect and designer .
color can <unk> simple <unk> , simple materials , if i go through new york , i think .
it &apos;s given me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we &apos;re all going to talk and build a few installations .
the operation that has laid down the city for the day , is considerable , almost an international model .
even the bits of the airplane had french computers .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and it was finally , like me , after some <unk> and <unk> , at the design of the chair i ended up showing you .
he said , you &apos;ve got one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re just going to be high .
but i knew from experience , and when i <unk> myself in the office , where there was <unk> <unk> , that never would have anyone to turn to the idea , to turn the headrest to bring them into position .
and dengue fever has risen in <unk> .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember the same , i &apos;ve been reading in a <unk> <unk> that <unk> the first <unk> <unk> , about 52 seconds , with about 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that really quantifies the fact that it &apos;s not going to spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males meets females , lots of offspring .
so <unk> are not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time i don &apos;t throw away , even though i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the data data .
now , our mobile phones can be construct a history of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : their health depends on where they live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
from the simple reason , nobody else is talking about it .
as at the beginning of the beginning , pulling plants from water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of an remarkable article from the nature of &quot; nature , &quot; the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of them are going to be lost .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and one that &apos;s going to <unk> some of the <unk> , some of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re doing in the world .
and he was called <unk> : he looked at all of the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps are withheld , but they repeat it without <unk> .
as an architect , i just think about relationships between the pieces and the whole , but in terms of design technology , it &apos;s always a matter of business .
we <unk> ourselves at the level of the building of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor of the <unk> .
let &apos;s come back again , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;re going to see that this landscape was truly saying , rather than rainforest .
the difference is particularly in <unk> in <unk> or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever they want .
here &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that are used to be paralyzed by the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers that are causing huge problems with water water ; in rivers , lakes and even seas , and it &apos;s the most important thing for <unk> .
but we can do that , and there &apos;s opportunities .
so irrigation is the largest <unk> on the <unk> .
to work together .
so , what is that , what is that system is that ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system that doesn &apos;t pay control .
we &apos;re interacting with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we &apos;re using biological amplifier to enhance these <unk> -- muscles .
this is what this looks like .
here we <unk> , or cut the nerve free , from little parts of the <unk> , and let &apos;s give other pristine <unk> that gave us our <unk> -- signal , two others , that gave us signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode inside and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- a little bit of clinical <unk> to wear .
this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa has been <unk> , there &apos;s 22 million people living with hiv , which are 0.7 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected with the world .
governments have to be able to create effective problems in clinical trials in clinical trials in clinical trials , which will be authorized in the different developing world , <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> by the government and the study of the study .
so the fundamental issues that we face is a high consumption and too many people .
so they &apos;re going to satisfy all the criteria that people would like .
so you can see that the stream that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> that &apos;s enough to the galapagos , and that <unk> , the <unk> that comes up with the galapagos .
we also know that not only are not <unk> , but they were equally vulnerable and other <unk> .
now i want to show you that penguins are drawn into <unk> .
turbo has <unk> himself to pat his <unk> at the door of the door . we put it in there .
and then there &apos;s another thing that &apos;s very comfortable <unk> .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our basic political geography .
the two parts are a pretty long frontier .
again , as the case of mongolia , china has conquered russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
in <unk> countries , china has reduced its <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia can be sold cheaper , and it will be cheaper to china .
what i want to show you is i call <unk> , day day .
these two arrows form a bow , an arch of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with gaza .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? what about the future of the european union ?
53 countries and half the suspects are curved lines on the map .
this is the ancient <unk> .
isn &apos;t it ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone encodes promotes the growth .
so how can it be a hormone speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones that are actively active in <unk> circumstances -- in good times , if food is available to low , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on lifespan .
in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of that i &apos;ve been talking about , which is the <unk> of the worm , a different normal <unk> , like a bird , so that the bird is a bird that can live much longer .
they &apos;re never going to see an ad because nike wants to buy their shoes .
they all show heroes , who became <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to walk into a football game .
so this view is a lot of <unk> <unk> as prozac as prozac as prozac in the brain , than whether the brain was the brain of a chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague seymour <unk> <unk> .
by the time , we found that there was a mutant , a lot longer needed to turn back to the <unk> again , and when we were the genes that were played in this mutation in this mutation , we could find a <unk> .
so this question has been asked for a long time , but in flight , we can actually test it .
so , the way that mosquitos find us in the dark by looking at us . they smell us .
just so you see it &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re going to be bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> did .
and every time , i felt the <unk> looked at the eyes of the eyes .
and as <unk> , fat is one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
while we &apos;re talking about clinical trials , about clinical trials at the study of stem cells from stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have these angels in the world . not just in our country , venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if what doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s going on .
and i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i left the news .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about the marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s actually even better . it seems to us that we can make these receivers , using the materials that encoded in the dna .
the animal goes , it &apos;s going to spread its wings , it &apos;s <unk> these , but it doesn &apos;t really pick up the fly between two <unk> .
for a intelligent nature like our fly , these are not <unk> in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal is learning through experience .
so through many of these trials , we were able to <unk> the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in <unk> and artificial intelligence , as you could do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior from the physical interactions of the physical interactions of living in living .
here &apos;s what &apos;s actually done , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : all right . sweeney : okay . take a little bit of the time , a little bit more to the center .
from their own experience , i know that the hospitals of young people can be a very dangerous place .
so here is an image from my <unk> legacy .
one of them , i &apos;m telling you this kind of <unk> , which is all associated with their goals , is the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health care .
they &apos;re not going to stick or <unk> or glue .
here &apos;s the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you turn on the bottom of the <unk> and it would be a <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
and so <unk> did . and he does this .
of course , completely different than you would see that in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say that people are going to work into the oceans and think about the goals , we should be much lower .
this is the vessel that i was with the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice is melting down the sea level to six meters .
what was the cause ?
in these two cases , the bad news is for the coral islands .
their relationship is the water temperature .
but then at the end of the end , you see the <unk> in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , millions of years of years we &apos;ve done it just with <unk> , but in this case , we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that asked einstein : to figure out how gravity works .
einstein had already been living in space and time , warps and curves to describe gravity .
but deep inside the structure of the room , the idea , it could be more dimensions than we see there .
and just like the strings of a <unk> different different kind of different strings , they can vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that may perhaps be able to explain some <unk> traits of the world , or can we show these extra dimensions in the world , or can we detect these extra dimensions ?
so we have two tiles with colored dots .
now , can you see the predator , see what &apos;s going to attack ?
and what &apos;s true of sensory information is true to all information .
and we &apos;re looking for 30 seconds , which is a relatively hammer , in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the table in that shadow , in fact , in the shadow , would be the same amount of light on your eye , and it would be the same amount of light outside of the shadow , you &apos;d have to reflect more -- just according to the physics .
how do you know that ?
and she comes in the beehive , finds a <unk> and hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . insane , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
often there is no right or wrong .
in 2010 , in 2010 , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the threats , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we face .
think of cancer , bird flu , swine flu , sars .
there were no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another sort of cognitive bias : i call it <unk> , by taking data to accept data and <unk> data to our <unk> .
i was familiar with another group , realizing that my airplane was safe to fly .
that &apos;s what people do .
and he was found out there at the time , at stanford .
they had good teachers with their teachers , students .
so let me ask you some questions about how this is a good choice . &quot;
i took anyone to get to get them to get them to get them , and i was able to raise them as an undergraduate , but i found that nobody was doing something .
we opened the first in 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups were very often immediately called &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a <unk> process that can deal with this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution from the arab world , a <unk> .
so the paradox is that the <unk> decade was so promising , and it &apos;s from one reason .
at once , the ngos , the ngos , they &apos;re not a little <unk> for the roads -- they assumed them in negotiations , because they were the victims of these guns .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy thing to work on a new business model .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and on the last day , the sun comes out , the <unk> come , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit i &apos;m a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of radical things about how we need to think differently about cancer , which is a lot more than a lot of people who are doing a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
there &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics in genetics , by looking at the genetic level .
and i like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good . &quot;
this is how we measure each <unk> as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some <unk> of it .
where we really have to get back , is the process that &apos;s just going on , and at the level of activity in the level of activity , the body isn &apos;t cure for itself , how does it matter ?
danny hillis : cancer .
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people .
because at stage three , most of us are most of us .
this is their <unk> .
there was no plan . never before anyone tried this .
in fact , martin luther kings was kings , in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and doing nothing . &quot;
and all of a sudden , they got the <unk> out and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we do the population of africa ? &quot;
automatically <unk> the little bits of plastic to the top .
these <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , which were designed to make it so much so much to make the taxes on the ground , they were not as permanent buildings .
she <unk> the stability and safety of the lap to give them a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the <unk> shape of <unk> .
i can &apos;t really tell you , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like these , symbols like these , are practical aid in a world that <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> of suffering , which could give us otherwise .
gandhi was a really <unk> person .
and the first day , our freshman day took us to fight and taught us our slogan that we had to make a day for the rest of the summer to create the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of her famous .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group , without <unk> people &apos;s minds .
so this is the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example .
okay , number two : go to the wild .
and imagine this is a <unk> image : i was born into a very small village in mexico , and unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no secondary school education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that &apos;s happening is that we &apos;re going to meet incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
so we &apos;ve got 30 different technologists of technologists in 18 different countries , and we &apos;ve been able to connect millions of people , trying to learn to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my father came to me , my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation you have to do better than the previous one .
i know a lot of people who are very smart and yet saying , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started to connect them together with another family .
don &apos;t you believe that we have the responsibility to take care of the environment ? &quot;
i still go through the same four years as well as before .
but this is not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
believe it or not , don &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
what is that in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball player , and that magicians represented her identity , what they &apos;re .
when my kids were little , i always went to her room , sat down to her bed and looked at my children .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet , it &apos;s a very significant number .
and then in a village , we have 100 laptops , each one of a different collection of 100 books , so that the village of all the village had 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
you answer the question : how does it feel , realizing you ?
we really learn this really bad lesson .
think about a moment , what it is for a moment .
and unlike any other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out it .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly <unk> book on a subject that everybody hate , for an audience that would never give .
the effect of course is not just <unk> wheat wheat , but mountains of grain .
in 1986 , she came from vietnam .
the answer was <unk> : &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank on a third of the <unk> in our business , and in the five years of the dotcom , our <unk> <unk> has <unk> .
and bhutan , for those who don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , first two years .
it &apos;s in the fact that we often hunt in the west as well as if the happiness was something that we need to capture , a thing , or maybe several things that we need to do .
and we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can impact the <unk> of production , by creating the right conditions , so our employees are able to live .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
in the deck , you &apos;ll tell you the <unk> , you move you , but your eyes are moving in unison with the boat , saying , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , come from the top ?
so , what did you do ? the results : what did you see ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and empower them to express them , and that &apos;s why amy is the last word in this short history .
poor people don &apos;t have this opportunity .
we were <unk> in the &apos; 70s .
and to get there , we need to recognize that the principle of a top-down is not only the breadth of the species we talked about , but our society <unk> .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody asked you , &quot; yeah , great stuff up there -- but how do i get there ? &quot;
i was a professor at the <unk> of <unk> , and i got a lot of attention to that , and that allowed me to fund the beginning of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they drop apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people wonder if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , you remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> cell phone woman .
and for those of you who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where they &apos;re not <unk> , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> poisons in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , filled with <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> death . &quot;
only months later , i learned who he was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive , if you can . &quot;
even with that <unk> paper in our hands , we have to redefine the hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows he was defeated .
so to give you this , we need to put it back to the driver .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people into it , we put the buildings from inside the inside , the <unk> . we helped save the first <unk> and rescue .
if i do this , i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m not the original details .
it &apos;s withheld from public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and what about democracy is .
here &apos;s the question : what country does better , china or india ?
because the indian man has an advantage in life expectancy expectancy is an advantage of two years of the indian woman .
and in terms of political change , they have <unk> <unk> .
so , in china , i think , still a couple of recent principles -- particularly in terms of social capital , public health care , public health care , a sense of equality that exist in india .
it was a place where people with moist backgrounds and with various <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now you &apos;ve spent the problem that they spent all the money to afford aid with these advanced electronics in these countries , and now everything is <unk> .
a little chaotic environment , where probably many ideas arose where people are more new , interesting , <unk> controversies -- people different heritage .
so , about a decade ago , a wonderful thing called howard <unk> <unk> , and i read charles notebook out of this period .
they <unk> themselves with their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was .
is the other way around ?
in the 1970s , &quot; one percent , &quot; 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
so many of these political factors can be summarized in the category of &quot; capitalism , &quot; political networks , who are helping a group of good interconnected , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
while you &apos;re fairly able to see how globalization and technological revolution is to create the global regime of money , it &apos;s much harder to grade the whole thing .
that &apos;s why you spend unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we &apos;ve created the modern <unk> .
this is his little hand .
one of them will all die .
that was a huge revelation for us , because we believed in a new development .
i think even in places like oregon , where oregon , where you can use , <unk> <unk> , only half a million people have ever done .
so , a long talk short , they came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most disfiguring disease of our time , how do they fit the good and the bad thing ?
some article went so far to say that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond that , not just against cancer , but it &apos;s going to be metastasized in skeletal muscle .
16 percent , 16 percent , that there were these <unk> tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the real estate -- what <unk> is capable of controlling angiogenesis , able to control the tumors that the blood vessels for themselves .
this is a very broad idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and i left my translator .
she was the girl in the breaks the other for her team .
and the same thing that i wrote , i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we went from the restaurant .
and he had children from korea , and he would find families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , look , and see , like burning from the side of the camels , the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bath and took up the bath , and we thought about our faces and the children .
until the adoption of the adoption , a year ! what does this have been so long ?
this is her <unk> .
this is a sydney in a few days .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , the point is that the science is that the science is the life of how we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , right here .
thank you very much .
you see , as uganda <unk> and zimbabwe <unk> , russia went on to one percent .
they find the highest hiv situation in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , the same rate as being in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it may be something else , what the transmission is more common .
we know that about <unk> billion people have ever lived .
it &apos;s not just an economic story .
and the result is actually a greater divergence in a shorter time than it was in germany .
likewise , it was with institutions .
they need to eat me . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions about the future , in 2016 , in 2016 , if the united states will lose its place as the number one economy .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> , despite the giant <unk> that we &apos;ve collected , irrespective of the evidence that we have lost our minds and <unk> other parts of our historical histories .
niall , thank you .
there &apos;s a lot of spider spider .
spider silk is almost entirely made of protein .
the fibers that make a single spider is pretty diverse .
also , <unk> have a high potential because of their capacity to <unk> .
what i want to pay attention is not the <unk> , as lovely as it may be , but the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there &apos;s more photos . there are more photographers .
this may sound <unk> in our ear , but what ended is happening is that 80 percent of the <unk> has contributed a lot .
the first thing happens , if you &apos;re a problem with a problem , the first goal of the institution immediately is that the goal of the goal is to change .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to figure out whether or bloggers journalists , or not .
it was created by creating their <unk> , which is the use of many of these tools , <unk> , no job intelligence in the world today to the attacks of the attacks .
you &apos;ve got <unk> , which is probably the <unk> part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because <unk> is from fibers .
everything is about his place . first .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s take a look at the different steps , under the <unk> of the kinds of connections -- my search is about to be the answer to the answer , &quot; what &apos;s so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re actually shaped , they go back to prove to prove that they are alive and creating character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of grain from every beer .
it will be a kind of <unk> while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these conventions , and at the time i &apos;m working on a piece of a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i <unk> my hair .
it &apos;s being demonstrated by brian <unk> , who is an extraordinary artist .
there &apos;s a little <unk> of the piece of the piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my graduate students , and i -- we put the babies two bowls with food : a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a bowl of <unk> .
i mean , last end , if we look at babies , we &apos;re pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the <unk> is bringing them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and vivid , and everything else is going to be like dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and <unk> of the human species , &quot; the <unk> alison <unk> . using a research research on how babies are sharing and make choices .
if i could give you a quick demonstration , just to show the difference -- because it &apos;s quite trivial .
and then you repeated this process over and over again , and again , until something comes out there -- in this case , the figure is supposed to walk forward .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes of how he came out .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some of our studios use our software to do exactly what we &apos;re going to see , and we &apos;re going to see a few of our <unk> in a few big <unk> .
we thought it was just the balance .
here you learn to go to the <unk> -- like most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i will never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re not lonely , you write a new york times column , then you get hundreds of emails . most of the things that i &apos;ve done today is <unk> of frustration .
there are just a few stories , and yet , but it &apos;s so understandable .
it <unk> . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new blank document in word , you might be able to make it !
but i think there &apos;s actually two more <unk> .
the other products were given from microsoft to an open standard , rather than apple <unk> .
and <unk> , when someone writes a <unk> -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; let me say , &quot; screw me . &quot;
but when i looked at the latest technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the <unk> kind of digital technologies made me very much worried about the <unk> .
and to cut the risk of these new things , we need to reduce the ability of the individuals that &apos;s going to give you access to <unk> power .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to create these <unk> <unk> in the back of the time that &apos;s going to make us draw from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , <unk> , you have all kinds of unbelievable properties .
and to give you an idea of the last of a little <unk> fund -- it &apos;s <unk> to 400 million dollars , which is quite remarkable .
and if you look at the concept of <unk> , you can create a much more participatory phenomenon -- the state of the marketplace -- to deliver feedback .
so 12 years ago , i was fascinated by <unk> , and i shifted my research .
wonderful and <unk> things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface of ice .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology to in this cave , that there are actually a large number of <unk> <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many properties that were used by people and other organisms used to be used for habitat .
always , if you &apos;re a goal , you need to be able to take away with his own steps , a certain way .
and it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> were made about it , and it was suffering under extreme <unk> .
so , before we could start to digitize the <unk> <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the way the electrons fly around the speed of light , they emit .
and that was a bad idea , because <unk> of <unk> had a son called alexander the great , and she lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , their data institutions with <unk> and so much more .
the original owners of the bottle of the bottle was a <unk> <unk> of the 1700s .
i asked myself : 160 dollars for what ?
it has four balconies .
a <unk> scheme is that many of these things are out of japan -- you &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i could not get in the fingers , and that was the <unk> blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call them my taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not important that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one that i was not impressed with .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid became sold for <unk> .
what &apos;s really interesting about virtuality is that you can measure them .
well , i could develop a game with the name of <unk> , by just one million pies , or a thousand pies .
when it &apos;s real boxes , we don &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and tragic is in it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , in 1999 -- gave it a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how personalized engagement can be transformed through the psychological and neurological insights that we get to see when we see people playing .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> <unk> , which is called <unk> as <unk> .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there are hunger hunger in america , 49 million people and almost <unk> million children .
and their farms are big .
it &apos;s the <unk> anniversary of <unk> grain and the big <unk> , by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in america and the change in the way that we have agriculture international .
this is a <unk> that i received two years ago . this was one of the biggest projects i &apos;ve ever been involved and my company had ever been involved .
but i &apos;m going to crunch myself in the beginning of the process , three very <unk> .
if we are so good at what we &apos;re doing , we shouldn &apos;t be able to be able to create an architectural manifestation that &apos;s perfectly sensitive through the <unk> and <unk> ?
the architectural controversy was , <unk> , simple .
and this is the actual reward .
the second technology that we used to do is we &apos;re using things that are familiar with the <unk> of the opera .
here &apos;s the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today how to collect stories , in some <unk> way .
one of these projects is about a year and a half .
these are the images that are automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera .
you can see a timeline , which shows the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , further .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> farmer .
what if you thought about the truth , what would you do , what would she do the next 35 years of life ?
&quot; money deserve and a store &quot; was the indian <unk> .
while anesthesia , he had told them that he wanted to be about <unk> of death .
don &apos;t make me wrong , writing it .
so the hand is almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then is limited communication .
very funny people , if lol does that mean .
you don &apos;t make it in a <unk> .
if anyone had seen a black board from 1858 in 1993 , the <unk> had been a little bit different for the time of &quot; love , &quot; but he was understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i still wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work next week at the whitney <unk> , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan is no existential threat to global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was an online <unk> optimism .
diplomats dig in <unk> .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we were in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success was to be part of the great part of our humility in our humility -- in the very <unk> fashion .
rory , she mentioned libya .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you what it looks like .
there &apos;s also <unk> , which are <unk> , but if you <unk> these <unk> , they &apos;re used for a different kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . that &apos;s a hard problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is , you know , what you want to do is valuable information more information about a general <unk> .
so , i think it &apos;s the minimal foods that we can possibly do to make things .
and we decided we shouldn &apos;t be so much about the cost of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that says , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> with kansas ? &quot;
so we have to wonder why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t interact with people who are not as much as you are .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only half , if i tell you that in the hospital , no one is going to believe in the hospital , without <unk> , mri and <unk> <unk> .
and then bell starts to his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century and early 20th century , the doctor &apos;s physician , who was trying to make a diagnosis , a diagnosis , the <unk> .
between the perception of the patient , and the physicians in terms of the best medical care is a real contradiction .
another experience i did in texas , before i went to stanford , i was influenced by stanford .
the bad news : the precise cause we don &apos;t know . can you see ? you can do that .
i remember so many giant , <unk> , <unk> eyes that ritual to me .
some call us <unk> , a more <unk> word .
in this case , we have been tested .
so for you here , there &apos;s a miracle , &quot; then a miracle .
and there was no way to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
it &apos;s harder to move the dead to the answer .
my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> , writing the book , &quot; the big bang , &quot; etc .
and you open your eyes .
you can open it up , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it &apos;s got me excited about that these guys , at least most , know what they do for a living .
all that thought was impossible .
you can make lots of change . you can make roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need everybody .
hugo <unk> has <unk> the <unk> and <unk> class in venezuela , and he has only led them .
and so it goes on .
they connect people with each other .
the reason this is taking modern medicine is a 60 years old .
there &apos;s a catch .
that makes it <unk> <unk> , over 600,000 times cheaper and over 400 times more <unk> than our <unk> <unk> for pancreatic cancer .
my experience with the islamic world are quite different .
so , there are the character of the character .
and why does sex make sex , and why does babies make a erotic disaster ?
because there is the secret of desire .
so especially important in this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in desire .
this is her <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , the natural instinct .
and then the desire happens . this research requires curiosity , <unk> .
you know , you know there &apos;s an erotic space that belongs to everyone alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
this is actually played in smaller rooms .
so early <unk> , some <unk> <unk> .
so i ask myself , ok , is this a model of design , that <unk> that we do ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me , and he said , &quot; this is me !
how do we solve the next three problems i want to bring to the language ?
albert einstein -- i was committing myself with somebody when i gave a speech , and i met mr. einstein .
what about life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rare has a so powerful spirit with the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was , what he was saying .
i &apos;m not going to talk about the <unk> <unk> .
but you have to sit about 10 minutes and you take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i was never in .
harvest <unk> .
with tears in my eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman standing in front of president <unk> and says how she and siblings were packed together , her parents died in war .
we go in rural areas and everything we do is what &apos;s happened in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look at 20 years from now , and see that there &apos;s another girl girl , a <unk> girl , <unk> girl on this ted stage .
lg : love .
licklider &apos;s <unk> , computers can do the necessary <unk> to make insight and make decisions .
each interaction is being recorded by more sensors : your phone , your credit , your computer , and it &apos;s a lot of data and we get to understand the opportunity to make our sense more deeply .
this record was human <unk> .
by a <unk> process , which is being introduced to a task for 40 people over three months , and it was a simple assignment for three people in 40 hours in 40 hours .
we should stop seeing outside .
dinner with my wife and children go home .
because people say , &quot; shit boy , i don &apos;t have time to make it . &quot;
she was a much larger dog than i thought .
these effects affect us all .
the <unk> of the state of congress is <unk> to our problems .
think of <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina , we have more together .
and they all have done this , and if you don &apos;t , you will .
help me make green to new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive map for my mom .
but i &apos;m kind of skeptical about these <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , put it on a pile and the pile of <unk> , the behavior of different characters in a game or a story , in this case of the big fish .
when you learn to code , you can program to learning .
when kids are creating projects like <unk> these projects , they learn very important concepts like variables , but it &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a context , is the idea that automobiles are art .
i want to talk about that .
and i think that this thought is that great driving cars is very decent , very decent . you all know that . you see a car with a soul at the first sight . you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> that is really our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or six , seven <unk> <unk> in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
and i think we felt very close to each other day , we were going through <unk> threads , and we <unk> the concept for the actual nature of true <unk> and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring it to boston .
because i just have a little lab .
so now we &apos;ve been clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that we can rely on these drugs .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you think about is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why the entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to you , we have a good theory that can explain this theory , and that &apos;s the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , although the universe lasts forever forever , and ordinary matter and radiation <unk> will become a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , some thermal fluctuations , even in the empty space .
but there &apos;s also big fluctuations .
it cools down .
it &apos;s a <unk> of the universe that you accept and not challenging .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i could not accept .
now i want to throw something out there , like me , say to the african and the poor people who dream with their dreams .
no matter what a movement i was doing in my real world was <unk> by my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my <unk> , and i put him a little bit of a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the camera is , interestingly , is not just my motions , but is able to understand what things i hold in my hand .
and why just <unk> ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning to india .
this is juan <unk> , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio to june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down under the earth to build a subway station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year , we have these terrible <unk> .
we lie under the average in terms of the <unk> in the city .
a city of the future is a city that doesn &apos;t come from this great community , which are cities .
and the best answer is to try and reconstruct a darwinian <unk> of our artistic and <unk> .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that they make a kind of attraction of gravity , so it makes you just look at it .
and some are in each case too large to use them for battles .
and our very strong reaction , the expression of feelings in the arts , the beauty of music , the beauty of the night sky is going to be , as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see the computer &apos;s the environment , and you can &apos;t see if you can &apos;t see the <unk> , we actually <unk> the rider with red leds so he can see what &apos;s happening .
see if you can avoid <unk> .
or for blind people , in papua <unk> in the household , in the training , education and the office .
a little bit of <unk> <unk> . the <unk> , that normal people don &apos;t listen to voices , and i heard it meant that something could not vote with me .
my mental <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , listen and <unk> and sexual <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , better than cure cancer . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> : if the social change begins , it can &apos;t be <unk> anymore .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through right now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , rather than mars , even though mars is a very much <unk> and interesting place .
and the common astronomers were full of contempt .
because the way that the way is that life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to the life on a planet .
there was another object , this high <unk> of these creatures and <unk> and naked -- pretty <unk> stuff for a young child .
so the first projects were humility , but they took technology and turned it into things , and then they turned into things that would use people to use a new kind of function .
the other thing , the <unk> is on <unk> , is that we decided to <unk> the whole gadgets , this whole <unk> , trying to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we call it y water , so that &apos;s another example where it happens in a room in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas of the brand , it &apos;s all intimately intertwined .
this is my <unk> anthony <unk> , in switzerland , he had the laptop for one afternoon , i had to take him back again . that was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects , the stories tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly <unk> and brilliant woman , became a <unk> widow .
she was the <unk> <unk> for the women i &apos;ve ever heard .
look at these young girls who come back to school after <unk> in their faces .
the world that sparked layma was given was a world war .
then they &apos;re going to be tense .
they need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation that grow up in a world where everything is <unk> and in some of our best conversations on a screen .
ultimately , it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if you wonder , why this is interesting at all , you need to look at the rest of saudi arabia because it &apos;s a land that &apos;s very close to the <unk> .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
so let me give you an example : in turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had something that i call <unk> , which was to protect the universities , against <unk> students .
if i think about the only person that thinks you would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims europe , they were independent europe , they were independent .
and that &apos;s why the e.u. process was that turkey of turkey to join the e.u. in turkey , within turkey , while some of the previous nations have been against .
there &apos;s a very big nose that he didn &apos;t seem to seem like , as if you &apos;re connected to anything .
now , if scientists are today , a century later , to make neurons , then let &apos;s move this from the inside , rather than <unk> them .
carl <unk> : glimpses inside the inside of our brain
but that trend is less clear .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague of mine , &quot; the <unk> at night was right at the right time , at the right time , he was on the verge of the genocide . &quot;
and instead of having a chance to put local leaders and international leaders soon , and they get distracted by the second <unk> , the events of the <unk> -- 2001 , 2001 and the wars in <unk> and iraq .
<unk> design requires a powerful focus on the <unk> , <unk> thinking and <unk> and <unk> .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in flat seas , life is already early ; it turned into more complex shapes .
<unk> <unk> went across continents . the great journey began .
some of the mammals went back to the water .
every man should be a little <unk> .
but there was nothing for that purpose , so we got <unk> with prostate cancer , and then we created our motto , which is , &quot; the face of the man is changing . &quot;
mo <unk> from canada , from the u.s. , and from england , and we called ourselves , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we were lucky enough to have 450,000 <unk> . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men of being involved in every age is so critical and important , and i think that &apos;s as much more important than the money we collect .
he was able to see what his forest was , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his <unk> when he was just two years old , and he started to teach him about the forest and the way of his people .
when i thought about , i wonder what our grandchildren and our <unk> would respond to the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human beings .
they work with people like <unk> krishna .
a life long , through everything , about the cultural revolution and everything that came to , he gathered up , he gathered about eight million bits of pieces in his museum , the contemporary chinese history document .
it &apos;s just happening .
&quot; my world is subjective .
or maybe he was just a yogi that was sitting on a rock and <unk> the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you lived an extraordinary life , you &apos;re going to get into <unk> , or , as the french call it , the <unk> -- -- the skies of the <unk> .
and so this is the great rituals that &apos;s built into the large <unk> of the <unk> and for 10 days .
you see , what &apos;s business , is different than a result of the behavior of the marketplace and the behavior of an organization ?
see , this is india today . the <unk> of reality is based on a <unk> view .
you know , he &apos;s built the largest cooker , it &apos;s called &quot; big <unk> . &quot;
&quot; why i chose this way , why don &apos;t you care about the procedures , you just get me . &quot;
<unk> <unk> opens the eyes for a new view of india , and the west -- shows why these <unk> systems of the <unk> of india and the west -- shows why these <unk> systems are <unk> with death and the <unk> .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world to say , &quot; i &apos;m completely competent , &quot; meaning , himself with the worst praise to defeat .
your interest is compared to what ?
your friends and family will come to the <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a tombstone , on the grave , saying , &quot; here is an excellent engineer who invented madness . &quot;
they &apos;re <unk> . this is the conversation , the mothers and dads , because your child is good at math , and you know what &apos;s good is good at math .
this is because they -- you know , what you are .
i have no patents , and i &apos;ve never got cash from a medical <unk> , and i &apos;m not saying that they choose me .
so where do you know if your breast is high density ?
ultrasound has more telephones to follow the consequences of other technologies to other technologies , and it &apos;s not very widely .
if you find a tumor , as long as it is less than one centimeter , the <unk> is over 90 percent , but it falls down to massive <unk> , but it falls considerably with the increase .
the image of the mbi shows this tumor is a lot of clearer , just like a second tumor that affect itself in the professional capacity of the patient .
it costs an radiologists of interest in particular training to be an expert on a single subject to tell a normal <unk> detail of a <unk> .
some women who kills breast cancer is a lot of years later , and luckily , most luckily .
dum da da da dum dum dum da dum da dum da dum , there &apos;s a lot of power .
we bring this physicists into los angeles to see what they &apos;re building .
mill are .
they have slept in this <unk> .
this is a <unk> vision .
it &apos;s a question of consequences .
so let &apos;s get to the point .
what did i do ? i heard on my belly ?
that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s another way .
the <unk> is basically a visual thing of a human being , where each portion is proportionate to the surface that it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll .
i was just making money .
thank you .
and he said to me , after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , <unk> , whether people don &apos;t find their throat , as my videos . &quot;
this is the reason i mean by david edward , a scientist from harvard , created an object that could absorb the toxic elements with these plants .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
the tragedies of people can take easier than your own , and i want to live the <unk> spirit of this conference .
according to malcolm gladwell &apos;s <unk> , it was <unk> the <unk> version of the <unk> .
he was a really interesting sight .
he went back to the second floor , and he said , &quot; hey guys .
like mcdonald &apos;s .
think about the comparison of other people , where you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang brilliant of marketing and was cheating .
economists talk about game theory -- that every game for two people has a <unk> game .
<unk> is skydiving with a board board on the feet .
<unk> at the high level as this is only possible , if you look at a step of time , if you &apos;re really hard to work harder and mentally work .
ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
occasionally i meet with scientists .
so i had the hope that i had a bunch of natural elements , a little bit of a fog , a little bit , i could make the space tangible .
<unk> means that it makes a difference whether you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are less .
how do we create an idea which is both <unk> to individuality , and also to <unk> , without the two in two different directions ?
i was talking about new kinds of <unk> , one who are attracted to the animals , rather than <unk> them .
but the incredible thing was the material to put the <unk> .
they take away from the dead .
at that time , he taught the classic college at <unk> college in <unk> .
natalie merchant : old poems for life
<unk> as a dolphin , hardly .
as a grown-up , when i <unk> across the amazing insights of the penny of the penny and <unk> , sue savage-rumbaugh , <unk> <unk> and alex <unk> , the <unk> , i heard this .
<unk> <unk> : ng : like this .
we &apos;re at the national aquarium , we &apos;re engaged in the national aquarium for the research and preservation .
and we realized quite quickly that we had created a system that connects people together .
today . this is the first time you &apos;re talking about this issue .
this is a picture of me and my daughter to keep a israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and they were so many . one day , i remember that <unk> with a journalist and asked him , &quot; who will see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is <unk> , but sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can avoid it .
and what we &apos;re talking about is more more powerful , to try to question that the architectural <unk> are almost defined by the fact that the architectural <unk> are almost defined by who or what we are .
and we saw this guy , <unk> .
and slowly , you start thinking that hard life is less fun to live than normal .
so let &apos;s go back to the expo , first to the dutch pavilion , and get a bicycle wheel , and drive it to another <unk> .
it was interesting because it was about nine to eleven to eleven , how many billions of them should invest in the business of business .
this is a <unk> from switzerland . in switzerland , there &apos;s a national need for <unk> <unk> .
we often do little movies .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest issues in the world .
but of course , it &apos;s a problem , if you ask people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m <unk> is really saying that we have a very long time , a situation where we had a number of choices .
and then they ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we do about it is very little , very high cost .
the <unk> rate of malaria is a few million infected each year .
what happens here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good movie in terms of which i want to see him is true , right , but don &apos;t expect to be <unk> in his next film brad pitt talks like he &apos;s <unk> in tanzania , or something like that .
they had all the same stuff , but they were able to leave significantly the frame of discussion , and that &apos;s what they &apos;ve done , they &apos;ve made it to <unk> with their own lists .
his power , wealth and greater freedom is <unk> . &quot;
secondly , china has been able to reduce the <unk> distribution rate of reducing the political framework .
freedom house found that although 50 percent of all countries today are , 70 percent of them are oppressive , 70 percent of them are oppressive , in terms of that people have no <unk> or <unk> .
because ultimately , the question is that we have seven billion other people on this planet : how can we create wealth ?
the <unk> isn &apos;t that right in your place .
we &apos;re going to really interest what we &apos;re interested in .
it was released six months ago , and just get incredible attention in germany .
you &apos;ve got to make sure of the growth of the growth .
i think it &apos;s easy to see a human skin , which fascinated me .
but i think it could be a pretty <unk> and sustainable supplement resource to our <unk> .
chinese workers are not <unk> in factories because of our <unk> demand for ipods .
just because one person has to spend her time to make a piece of something that is not going to happen to a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him around and said , &quot; some understand that . you don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
this is the <unk> , the <unk> of my family home to her family .
the taliban run their own schools .
if any child gets caught , these rules will break it hard .
when i look at suicide bombers , when i look at the younger , or at my age , i feel so inspired by her <unk> .
and this is where we arrive at enceladus on enceladus , which is to wait for <unk> , which is hopefully at some point in the future , specifically equipped to track .
is the internet actually a place to visit ?
and the landscape of the landscape , three years ago , when i started studying myself , there was just a cable on the african west coast west , represented here in this map of steve , black <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t seem right .
so this data is going to be added to layer on the device , starting with the base of the product , and put that material layer up at layer by creating a new layer by the new <unk> process in a <unk> layer .
it was made by <unk> by layers of layers of layers .
you will probably probably get less .
you can just make it easy .
here &apos;s the product .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology is a revolution in the production of manufacturing and the <unk> as we know them .
he was worried that when he called her name , especially out in the public , you could think it would be the idea of jihad .
they use his <unk> .
the good news is that it &apos;s not going to be that .
but many of these factors that play a role is actually more powerful . half of the work is done .
i was with my girlfriend susan <unk> , the <unk> , in the mathare valley .
she said , &quot; you know , the poverty wasn &apos;t the bad thing . it was the shepherd and the excitement of the whole thing . &quot;
do i think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of the two months , instead of flying and forgotten , the time was very much <unk> .
but it &apos;s less likely to stay .
and during my first year , i led my business .
it &apos;s actually used to say that more energy is needed to make a solar cell as it gets into their entire <unk> .
solar panels , but for four , four and a half hours .
and also , they &apos;re under great pressure and they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder here at the bottom , which is the generator and all the <unk> in itself , and this is the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder -- that &apos;s cold cylinder , that &apos;s cold , and it comes electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it &apos;s also cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a way to use that energy as fast as we do it right now .
we <unk> it up and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory lab with which we did this molecule in the region of this molecule .
but i still wrote bad poetry , and he never hunted the <unk> into the air , but he went to cuba .
so , made out of <unk> , great things -- -- that i &apos;d like a picture of a picture that &apos;s going to land in my work .
i work for the new yorker , and i &apos;m doing <unk> , and then the 9 / 11 was september , and that was , the <unk> end of the world as we knew them .
and then they don &apos;t make you clear , <unk> , <unk> with the tongue , but so we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that the <unk> had gone extinct . &quot;
this man is angry , because somebody &apos;s all <unk> around his staircase , and basically -- you know , <unk> seem to be a subject to be here .
and she &apos;s also <unk> <unk> , so i don &apos;t think .
td : so since my youngest childhood , and after that , i had given a lot of different obligations , and when i was young , i was always a kid , i was always a <unk> .
it &apos;s very beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should be going on an inner basis .
td : so lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone , because of all , what she did was , and i was pretty resistant to it , and i was very resistant to it , and i was very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples we &apos;ve seen machines that have been learned in the simulation of the simulation , and others who have learned to the reality .
if i say , &quot; we , my advice for <unk> .
but no one believes that it &apos;s actually very powerful if there &apos;s an overall outbreak .
the biggest part of the spending was in the bush administration of bush , in fact , in conjunction with anthrax , and the threat is in <unk> .
we know that the virus will be poured . it will be another virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a debate debate about what percentage of people &apos;s human beings through <unk> and coughing , and how much on the hands is happening .
some of the poorest countries that most of the experience of h5n1 have had a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who are already gone .
and i think even our leaders would say in this case that we have a lot to do .
i &apos;m very excited to answer your questions .
our centers in <unk> have one of them developed testing tests -- as rapid <unk> .
and in the early 1930s , people were similar bacterial infections doesn &apos;t have a problem .
don &apos;t just watch how much fun you have to do with it , but also , how that <unk> changes completely the way to interact with san francisco .
so , please put a <unk> .
i <unk> myself with a young batch of a force , and he <unk> one to sell three clubs .
since i was in my childhood , i played with <unk> and climbing , the case is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
manhattan is no longer an infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to <unk> here , right ?
i stay in the middle .
she became one , <unk> me .
because the <unk> leaves and the branches are very dark at the very dark and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of the <unk> are interested in the dynamics of the <unk> , living in the forest .
we &apos;re advising the media on <unk> ; we &apos;re having a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then the students in our <unk> came , and they took their own <unk> with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn from the frog to grow <unk> <unk> , which is highly <unk> from extinction to washington washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look , what you &apos;re hidden before . &quot;
that &apos;s why we see a rising demand for <unk> , and so therefore .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
they have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go underwater , the higher is the pressure .
so i started looking at 15 years ago .
it &apos;s going to breathe the air in the <unk> , and the air comes out of the air .
every one of these computers can do the whole system , so if two of them are out there are still reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat comes across many miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people represent them .
when we found it , we didn &apos;t even know what to do , to which family family , so we called him <unk> &#91; unclear &#93; , because he looked like him from one books .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> and it <unk> .
this means every one and every one of you here are at least a child who suffers from a developmental suffering .
and its communication and social interactions improved so that he could visit a normal school and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s something like life : once you &apos;re in , you can &apos;t get out of it .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you &apos;ll notice that day , someday you &apos;ll hear from him because he &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had about lots of love , he loved everybody .
we all , all of us , are what happens when you get a <unk> out of hydrogen and helium and helium so that they start to wonder about their origins .
this <unk> shows that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to learn the diversity , and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first way to value deeply , to connect with life elsewhere in the first time .
by doing silicon as a matter of silicon , and we &apos;re going to expand it in the way that we expand about 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive , and the moore &apos;s law has been expanding and the moore &apos;s law .
and then we &apos;d like to make the <unk> search for human <unk> .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to explore the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
while they &apos;re <unk> with the ice , they <unk> a pair of gloves into an oven , so you can put a new pair of <unk> when your <unk> <unk> and your fingers are stiff .
i think that &apos;s a little <unk> .
and our soldiers are excited to look at pipelines to <unk> the <unk> station in <unk> , if they were <unk> to the service of america .
you can still run this further , and the efficiency is almost even <unk> improvement , and it &apos;s going to double the size of the great <unk> rate .
we could build bigger cars , which is going to be contributing , but light should be easy .
but instead , they &apos;re selling it to china and japan , because we don &apos;t have protection of our <unk> <unk> and the other .
and by the way , by the way , by the way , the approach to the <unk> mass of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to make <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> , the <unk> can &apos;t create the same as the <unk> of the internet .
it &apos;s not easy to act a giant conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we &apos;ve obtained .
let &apos;s hope that it &apos;s really stable .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
at the end of the end , he found a <unk> called <unk> van meegeren was selling him a wonderful vermeer to a prize that was about 10 million dollars to <unk> today .
according to his <unk> , he looked like he had discovered that there was bad news in the world . &quot;
&quot; it depends on . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive they find them sexually or romantic moves , depending on what you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has value value beyond what it is , because of his story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even if i can &apos;t recognize the difference .
so he took joshua bell to take his <unk> into a subway station in washington d.c. , to take a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock hurts less because you used a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see that there &apos;s maybe a kind of political <unk> .
they <unk> that she &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is of course , that people who eat vegetables and oil ate less <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> end , if you give a drug into a high dose , that there &apos;s more side effects , and that &apos;s what your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that there &apos;s no solution .
and very soon , they &apos;ve started taking this coal <unk> , 15,000 to 1,000 , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , back to china and all around the world .
can you imagine how they would feel , if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , all you know .
there &apos;s this thing , the <unk> of the world , and that &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what you see ? they &apos;re christians .
boy , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they generalize . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everyone else are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of you at the morning , and she &apos;s hugging one of them in the morning and she said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m going back .
everything has changed .
and all this has got enormous implications for the world .
i think thomas jefferson did really give you a very good words .
in the audience in the audience in the audience in the audience , you can see why <unk> is a greater budget than a <unk> , and then let &apos;s translate a lot easier into other languages and cultures . so the market is getting bigger .
but it will happen within this century .
this is not the <unk> of the u.s. , what &apos;s going on over a million , but the gdp in the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
also , as anyone here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a lifelong obligation that started to grow up at the gulf coast on the <unk> .
a lot of our actions on this planet which are associated with our living environment , are just motivated by belief and motivated .
one has been every time for thousands or millions of years .
we need to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : life on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the genome of the passenger pigeon 1.3 billion base pairs .
the introduction of de-extinction falls into this category .
real falcon is <unk> chicken .
it &apos;s a program to <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional theme . some people are standing up there .
my grandmother was a housewife .
i also made my own comics , which was another way to tell stories , through words and images .
and we sat down there , in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . don &apos;t draw how you tell you .
&quot; rather <unk> , i get rid of you .
and i &apos;m also going to publish a book book called &quot; <unk> police <unk> : the <unk> for the <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us constantly physiological , psychologically , <unk> and <unk> .
this is an 32 million pounds of expensive , important <unk> , which was built in england designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected .
people who say , let &apos;s have the team right next to this team , because the noise like the noise and the other .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary business who is carrying his life in the suitcase , and the between dream and reality is not able to <unk> both .
<unk> <unk> and four and a half years later , and how did that , as a <unk> , began to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
i know theater connects us .
now the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a smart , important , important work , and <unk> .
if you look around in the bathroom , you can see some products more , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen , collagen of pigs -- is used to inject it to inject it .
i &apos;ve found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got a long and <unk> year . &quot;
i said to them , you should , you know , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they have given me to be somebody in a time , in a time that i felt like a no one .
they &apos;re working on the ninth issue , so that it &apos;s going in the 1930s and now it &apos;s the letters p .
hundreds of verbs can behave .
you can see it as the language of thought or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the mysteries is , in polite requests , in polite requests , <unk> and <unk> so often ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could be literally used .
and the other mysteries is that i don &apos;t have a problem .
here &apos;s my argument . is it practical ? is it good ?
it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what &apos;s the insight that you won , to convince me ?
all of these different roles . can you imagine an argument that you participate , but in the audience , you &apos;re in the audience and watching yourself ?
or -- and this is the <unk> part of me : we want them to be <unk> in the world of nature . we bring a <unk> and find the masters of the senses that could inspire us .
that changed everything . from these engineers , these engineers don &apos;t go into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national laboratory .
that would be <unk> for fuel cells , if you could run without <unk> .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses a subset of elements in the <unk> .
feeling and reacting : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia , almost half a million companies are women .
because , as you notice the <unk> , smaller <unk> <unk> in the face of the <unk> are <unk> .
and the rest of all the world are not exceptions .
people <unk> whether this <unk> and this miracle .
i have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> himself , himself <unk> cows on my hometown , and i want to use paper towel , to <unk> it .
first we did it .
what does that mean ?
and when i started to work with them , i found that they have incredibly good adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they ended up and <unk> the campus , and i &apos;m sure you were glad to come up there -- some time later , a few days later , and realized that the crows still came to them .
we &apos;ve found that they &apos;re really smart , and they can teach each other .
squirrel , for example , come across the peanut , go and go again .
but there were three problems , three mysteries i could not solve , and i want to talk about it , but even more importantly , i &apos;ve found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has to offer something .
let me make the connection .
you know that there is the <unk> of the future , you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot to <unk> .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of the notes .
maybe about 10 million <unk> .
and over here , we see in the words of the radiologists israel israel , &quot; how the hand works the penis in a way that reminds me of <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i &apos;d rather get to the end of the food , if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book that was <unk> out of the <unk> , and there was a <unk> maria <unk> , who had trouble with conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i &apos;ve got to read them what she said , because i think it &apos;s so beautiful .
this is me very unfortunate . not because i want to use it . i wanted to see him .
and this is actually the beginning of our story .
now i would have thought to that moment that was the age of 50 , one of the skills that i really had , was to bind my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know right now where he wants to <unk> the different colors .
but i can see in their faces , they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have something fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i shaved <unk> .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
my father was one , so my youth was so interesting .
that song is as mere fact .
i mean , &quot; wait a minute , i put the wheels -- i put the wheels out , &quot; i bought the <unk> wheels , and i built them , and -- you know , i could have my <unk> wheels ?
it sounds simple , but i think we &apos;re in general in our society and culture with the <unk> of the <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> himself , and he was really quite proud of it .
man , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet that has already been seven billion people .
very specifically , he was sitting on the cushy seat , the real <unk> seat he had given his <unk> , and the beautiful <unk> around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- consciously lived , the original thing is a bit better .
i looked at the healthy mass of one of the left and i <unk> that she was lost , <unk> all of the things that i didn &apos;t do yet , now , but no more .
and then i started to wonder how many times before my life would have been , if this was not injured me , if this man had not injured , if my genes would have a different proportion of experience .
i was , but i was myself , despite myself , i was myself , and i guess i made myself myself .
i was hoping to be a little uncomfortable with this : this turkish <unk> against four words , and let me go back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we work with the machine <unk> laboratory at university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people . and second , a natural interface , a natural shape of control , so that the interaction with the robot becomes more intuitive .
and yet , i made this idea .
after i realized this economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some people have <unk> to speak like nathan <unk> , or the one of tim ferriss , or the one that may be considered a hard to be considered .
i don &apos;t know any tedtalk that includes this .
this time i was paying 25 cents , because i thought the assignment was a little harder .
and yet , there was one thing that were safe to be able to slow down .
keep the mystery of dark energy in mind , because i &apos;m going to call you three <unk> of string theory .
the <unk> went to about 10 to 500 .
and he worked decades of explaining to explain this number , but it didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes have extra dimensions .
because astronomers from today , by creating powerful telescopes around the sky , discovering a few <unk> photons -- some sort of <unk> photons , billions of years .
well , i &apos;m going to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you make him meet it , but we really want to get really excited and more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> . &quot;
pm : so that &apos;s dimitri &apos;s <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anybody .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv goes from , armed arms men are on the street .
and it was a very <unk> meeting of reporters who worked on the war , the employees of ngos , and of course the bold , courageous people from sarajevo .
if i &apos;m asked , why i &apos;m going to keep <unk> <unk> , why i &apos;m going to stay .
but my job is my job of <unk> , and this is the <unk> , the nub of the thing , for us reporters .
even before the goal appears to be able to figure it out to the point of <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s trying to figure out what it is .
we basically <unk> the animals , so they learned to control the <unk> and to explore objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment that we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was finished .
raise your hand .
the last reason to do with this is that women are part of the solution .
in niger dies , one of seven women dies at birth of a child .
she became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he <unk> as chairman of the world bank , once said , &quot; well , it can be good investment in the developing world of girls in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
all the <unk> around a single of our <unk> tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this picture is making sense of the suspect of being <unk> -- like something from <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of these options was that we could have a little <unk> .
they put their arrowheads up , and they say , &quot; i want to share these calculations for the finished arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can meet all three or four miles into a new language .
when 27 individuals went out of these 27 members of these 27 meetings , their 23 languages were <unk> , then they &apos;re just <unk> the army from <unk> to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared for all the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they were talking about language .
and what interests me most is the invisible space between a text and the kind of image , and what &apos;s the image through the text , and the text through the image .
this is <unk> <unk> , who are running across the bottom of the atlantic ocean and north america with europe .
they &apos;re the negative .
but the idea of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> sat eight years of a 10 and a half of <unk> in arizona , for the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of a <unk> boy on a <unk> boy .
it &apos;s where people are leaving themselves .
and they brought them to texas .
and now they &apos;re riding with the <unk> , where they &apos;re in the moment .
it &apos;s just the kind of space that &apos;s going to look like this is not a <unk> .
so something called hooked on a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
partly , this is the legacy of legacy , the <unk> , the pursuit of happiness for happiness , and it &apos;s not going to be found by <unk> aspects of the individual and <unk> in reality .
a <unk> in the science of happiness is that happiness and <unk> no <unk> in a closed-loop circle .
it starts in <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a three year-old baby baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why would you choose rats ?
as soon as the rat understood , we make it a little bit harder .
you can actually cure t.b. , even people who are hiv-positive .
so with knowing that a patient , which is a little bit of <unk> to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , can be secure that we &apos;ve saved many lives .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is : if i &apos;m looking at a different person , why am i not <unk> , why am i not <unk> , and literally watching this sort of <unk> of what &apos;s being touched ?
thank you . i &apos;m two missions today .
i don &apos;t really think about it , it &apos;s not about the pollen .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> in the lab from kew of kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell us the <unk> .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we ever saw women and death in heart disease , they wrote an article for the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , x-ray , <unk> , for women whose <unk> are disabled , and every time we <unk> something that &apos;s just a small amount of radiation , saying , &quot; is that the test is really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we go .
they &apos;ve done what they &apos;ve said they were <unk> , and they &apos;ve got the lead funded .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish , they &apos;re not native .
what does that mean ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours a day , collected about a <unk> hours of <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> , which was a little bit more than a year ago that we were really surprised .
and finally , my son is playing alone in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project philip <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy &apos;s here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamics in the game .
this is the first time that our son took more than two steps -- captured in the film .
and this is an important question , because the better we understand how the brain is generated , the better , the better we can communicate . i think better , better , we can work together and work .
it &apos;s a center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh , i have a powerful or emotional response to that . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is our teams <unk> the entire teams to paint on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just <unk> , but it &apos;s about the possibility of relaxation .
so there &apos;s no way .
if you translate it into the industry industry , if you &apos;ve got a <unk> and you crushed a window , you &apos;ll just say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we set up .
are we just stupid ?
you can pass through it in two years when you read eight hours a day .
so it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> and say , &quot; i &apos;m important .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police are waiting for the door of the firemen to cut the vehicle in pieces to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present to the present in the united states in the united states , looking at the eye of the divine .
so all of this leads to us -- <unk> , just to name this : what we do most is to use digital devices .
this is the implication of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side by the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the healthcare system .
and he was holding my jaw in the right position as he <unk> <unk> my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and quotes , who &apos;s fascinated with the <unk> , whether it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> .
now , i had to figure out in the dark years , and i was able to figure out what was going to be doing this , disappeared .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : if you have the opportunity , spend time with simon .
and these were the developing world : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this page . a large <unk> of africa and the world .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought it back to a way .
a search is that we can copy the data into a <unk> form and we can publish the data , and what are we hearing ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin &apos;s life explains that , after it emerged , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned about francis crick .
but there was a lot of literature in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was unhappy ; i was not married .
so you can kind of compare dna to the normal sectors and <unk> .
and so , i close off by saying that we have to tell 20 people with schizophrenia .
on average , it costs the defense in one case two million dollars , and it takes 18 months when they win .
first of all , fighting not the patent , but against the <unk> .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to leave you with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; they asked girls .
the fathers were in a place where they &apos;re going to move their daughters to play their <unk> and their hand to the dance .
that &apos;s a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
you can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and so they needed a different approach to eradicate polio when we had smallpox .
it helped to control pandemic tests , sars for example .
the reality of polio nowadays is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the hardest places ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio <unk>
dj : we found this <unk> in all sorts of animals , especially with the cats .
and our surprise was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant , in many ways , a symbol of inspiration has become a symbol of inspiration that &apos;s been accompanied by our work .
it was incredibly amazing when she took it to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at this <unk> , she was reminded me of a human hand , and this is ironic because it &apos;s ironic because their fate lies in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community , as part of this planet , and we need to continue on .
but after all , it seems to be obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun is small and cat , but it &apos;s worth , what &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and that &apos;s because there &apos;s always been there in middle world .
nature of the model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because between you don &apos;t have a consensus on its <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the way we see him in middle world , <unk> and <unk> .
people as a machines to treat science may be scientific and <unk> exactly , but it &apos;s a waste of time when you want to guess what the next person is going to do .
overnight , i became the <unk> <unk> at the time of 40 years old .
over a <unk> that i &apos;m controlling my head , allow me to see these <unk> videos and sending them to sending out the pads in a <unk> .
with the help of people , we can make this dream .
in oceanography , for example , a <unk> shift is designed to evolve the <unk> of the <unk> , visualizing the dolphins .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
now there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but don &apos;t normally do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to do .
i also assume that most of you don &apos;t talk chinese -- what &apos;s really sad , if you think that this is the most common language on the internet .
what &apos;s looking at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why should me be interested in this ? &quot;
but there &apos;s all these different techniques that allow them to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence overcome and make sure countries never <unk> terrorists .
and part of that activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war , the 20 million people , who took 20 million people living in the world today .
<unk> sen , who is this guy , &quot; i &apos;ve got all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all of this time to look at the american man who had my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which started in fact in new york city in the early 1970s , when i started in university in new york city , when i first started university in new york city in the early &apos; 70s .
so what we see in the 17th century 18th century is the <unk> quest for medicine to make the same thing .
so people would have a really big <unk> .
when the <unk> began to become less , i was always <unk> , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
remember , as a child , remember to each line ?
at 18 and 19 , i slept overnight .
and again , i &apos;m going to get a little depressed and something <unk> .
so many of us is clear that it &apos;s a lot to do that in the next few years .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know . where did the world worked on the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the world , who made out of the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you <unk> the impossible , you make it possible .
but we have a agreement to change climate change .
and there was crying .
the <unk> power is something remarkable : they &apos;re using two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their competitors to create a material that is extremely hard to create comparable with technical fibers .
or you <unk> beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture the camera .
here &apos;s how it &apos;s taken off by the tissue .
with my new project , <unk> <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to dismiss the stream and the round of applause and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him make some of his closest decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this unprecedented demonstration , heather , heather knight data , a <unk> , which is far more more than <unk> <unk> -- he collects the feedback of his audience and how to be the same thing ?
stanley <unk> , inventor of the famous <unk> of <unk> , emphasized in the <unk> and <unk> that there are two types of people with only five to seven steps .
how does our view think about relations with <unk> groups ?
however , there was a cardiologist that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he could tell me , and where he could have those bug in the ear .
um ... my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
and this feeling of responsibility with others of others , despite his young age of 17 years of age , and also his fault , to be a <unk> <unk> , while his friends were left , kept his friends , kept his whole life .
and as my <unk> and my <unk> , they believed <unk> , i thought , he had false papers .
i asked him , given the victim , the victim of the victim , he had the <unk> .
we are growing by a couple of millions of people on the seven billion people that we &apos;re today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> , which is a <unk> for the next <unk> .
if you <unk> the forests , the boundary of <unk> exceeds the border , you get the capacity to stay stable stable .
with the knowledge of <unk> , fishers , the <unk> great barrier reef <unk> and scientists , the great barrier reef is falling under the current of the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , is clear that <unk> change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today , because i really like a media .
this is a <unk> of a race of <unk> .
first of all , it uses an ancient kind of making the <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technique at that time .
and through the process of sugar at black <unk> , i made portraits of them .
it was very large images , and i took them with a very big camera camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially at worse <unk> , very far .
and on the back of the back is a sequence that occurs too .
so we can ask , is there universal differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people .
and then we can ask ourselves to be the same questions , like neanderthals : do they mix with ancestors today ?
there &apos;s a lot of people who designed their own vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future is his own consciousness .
imagine <unk> growing in the printer , and are embedded in a <unk> area , and follow the forces that occur in its components .
they &apos;re not talking about . but they were very remarkable isolated from the world around them , from their surroundings and from people .
they were <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
and you have the sense that the research that you &apos;re concerned with is really a effect on the reality that you can actually prevent those experiences that i actually started to prevent these experiences with that area .
then you pick up .
<unk> <unk> you <unk> yourself in a rigid position -- chin <unk> , arms <unk> on your <unk> .
they did everything exactly as we taught them .
and after the battle , they get this mobile phone , and do what you call &quot; <unk> , &quot; to teach you what you did .
the people have changed .
i asked , &quot; where is he ? &quot;
that &apos;s not easy .
and she showed up on the left to tell me how problematic this image was , that it was <unk> for them with the idea of how black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of <unk> that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m doing .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how are we supposed to do this . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you deal with you before you &apos;ve decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
her <unk> has increased to 50 , which is <unk> schools in a <unk> biotechnology of biotechnology .
76 percent . in the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted lectures he wanted to be <unk> da vinci .
these are <unk> .
suddenly , i looked from the darkness , on the <unk> side of the time , a <unk> of mirrors that were <unk> by the moon .
if i needed to reduce the whole story , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some snippets from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest -- the storm -- the <unk> .
and our little lives ends up in a sleep .
bono : &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that &apos;s driven by health and business .
so let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> , which we have , and figure out what price people would pay for , so they have the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother could not understand it , we could not use it in the video .
we destroyed two <unk> and 10 tv tv .
the little <unk> of it , to remove it from its tracks , and that was a problem .
this is good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models that i work with .
and creating tissues from high density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the key to use these models to use these models .
thank you .
so the attempt to fly them just like the attempt to take an arrow with the <unk> end , and it was hard work , and boy , boy , boy , boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s take the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even <unk> developments , like <unk> <unk> -- with darpa , california institute of technology and the university of london .
be careful , if you just look like wood or something like wood .
now i &apos;m not trying to be <unk> .
they go forever .
that &apos;s about two billion .
it takes him to think about it , &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one day .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in the human minds and machines can win together .
i have clear mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s the fear that could get extinct in the wild in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence points that this cancer is going to transmit from a virus .
i took the opportunity right now and took some samples out of jonas &apos; tumor and some samples from other parts parts .
she brought him to a vet and that discovered something <unk> .
ultimately , cancer is a <unk> consequence of our cells to share our cells and adapt their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> for waiting .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation isn &apos;t happy .
but they didn &apos;t remember the numbers on them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken , if we &apos;re aware of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is in asia , which is gradually coming back to the half of the world &apos;s population , again , more than half of the world &apos;s population .
you could look at this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after the year , the soviets had sputnik had said , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re living in japan or new delhi or <unk> , your view of china will be something different than if you live in beijing .
and if we put strategies in which we &apos;re going to bring this into greater historical context , we &apos;re capable of doing this process .
how do we define our national interests , so it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> yet .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
and this has typically the responsibility of the peacekeepers to <unk> a stable <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re in the long time .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after most of the law &apos;s law , you can &apos;t even get educated .
the market would be provided by the conflict , government demanded .
this is the contents of my hometown of new orleans .
the military is what the military is , they call the climate change a <unk> , security and stability as governments in the world debate how to react .
it allows you to become more productive , so that they can afford to be able to afford the insurance .
these are the inspirational examples of possible solutions , if we feel able to plan to plan for a <unk> world .
listen to how the chinese teaching english teaching english .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect .
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , using abstractions , which we &apos;re trying to make sense of physical , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , so we &apos;re going to wonder what could be .
luria looked at people before they <unk> the scientific age , and he found that these people are resistant to a taxonomy of the world .
there was luria , &quot; the north pole , is always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it was not just the spread of <unk> <unk> .
would she earns it to be killed ? &quot;
you could say , a <unk> .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they <unk> me to make a degree in anything .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifice , this film <unk> .
i &apos;m one of her <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all mad at them : &quot; why do you do that ?
this is a lot of real real time you read him . &quot;
we had a game over school for weeks for weeks , about seven weeks , about seven weeks , and we had <unk> all of the 50 <unk> crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people announced <unk> jobs and <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like its own little connection .
if i put all three legs of it , in the three quarters of the triangle , i would get an <unk> .
so all the things you &apos;re doing is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> app -- this old <unk> and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; -- this <unk> <unk> is very simple in an old <unk> .
this is possible , if you &apos;ve got a whole piece of paper , <unk> paper paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or in a state of school -- a leaf , a ruler and a pencil , no glue , no .
what we &apos;re doing is a very simple motivator .
this is a little straw , what you do is , you know , is these two corners here , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
here &apos;s two magnets .
it was a lot of passengers on the ship , and they got bored , so the captain asked them to be a <unk> .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> gupta is simple , but it &apos;s stunning plans to turn waste in really <unk> , good , constructed toys that can build the basic principles of science and the design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually given examples of biology to a lot of evidence .
and there are some examples of the projects that we &apos;re trying to do is imitating ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can guarantee a space of transport , into a turn that offers an open space for people to connect people back to food and waste into opportunities .
this is the photograph of the day in the day , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you <unk> seawater , the first thing is <unk> <unk> .
no , you &apos;ve got to go through the people &apos;s minds with <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish because i was jewish , and because it &apos;s very important .
but the actual <unk> was that there were very many men who wanted to date with me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with itself .
he would like to go , unless it &apos;s not on a <unk> .
i was trying to basically be like <unk> .
because remember my <unk> : you need to get a <unk> of 700 points , and no one does .
most of them . <unk> are the average of the average age , not eight years , and if we look at the <unk> demographics of the <unk> , the <unk> of tomorrow &apos;s older older adults .
imagine that their vision is very , very good .
these <unk> have a lot of other benefits in attention and a whole aspect of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is much better , our ability to pursue objects .
so i want to ask you to remember the outcome of this result , and put it into the context of another group of <unk> , a group that actually looked at what &apos;s been high in our society , which is where people are working .
so let me explain this one step with a task called the mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
so let &apos;s just make all kinds of things that we &apos;re looking at , running .
so it was a big , very complex project , from which i didn &apos;t even know if it &apos;s going to work .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with the kind of <unk> , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> , able to do a lot with just a few lines .
so with physical <unk> , we are basically used to go to the world and see that certain technologies make sense of certain technology and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited at the discovery that there are candidates universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully explores a special relativity and <unk> general relativity and gravity and at least evidence of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and while that time , i actually lost more of relatives , and teachers who resisted me , hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a real estate and automatically owned everything that my family had owned , anyway , my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony were dancing , we were excited , and didn &apos;t slept all night .
and he was <unk> , and he was in a village that had not even <unk> roads . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a sympathetic girl , i would come back and do everything that they would ask for me .
if the marriage was pregnant , the mother was made for it to be responsible .
as we speak here , 125 girls will never be <unk> again .
consumers , who represent 72 percent of the american gdp are actually beginning to actually do the banks and companies pay back to <unk> , to <unk> their <unk> , in the everyday life , even of incentives that we face .
and finally , what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we &apos;re actually <unk> , and in principle of the future , the future children of our homes .
<unk> are up to <unk> 48 percent , the following institute .
we &apos;re also seeing a trend to something <unk> . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and our neighbors american spirit as a support .
we &apos;re also seeing a big <unk> .
the <unk> is immense .
and then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got the question , i &apos;m the only one that does ?
you could exploit them .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing in my life -- stories are writing , novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and some of these supernatural creatures that are <unk> .
our <unk> could be shrinking . our hearts could be stunted . and our <unk> could be <unk> , if we keep in the very long time within the cultural <unk> .
there was the first time i encountered the first time , as i call it &quot; rare . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no <unk> or <unk> . i will ask why i do this , but the commute between languages allow me to invent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of mine .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i was prosecuted .
literature has got to lead us to the other side .
i could get a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that &apos;s going to be a happy story . and in my next book , i write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so , you know , you &apos;re already going to throw existing songs , cutting them into little bits , creating these little bits , put them together , and you get a new song , but this new song is clear from old songs .
instead of using these laws and laws in the world , and the laws of the protection .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to sum up what it covers . <unk> eliasson : the <unk> of the telephone , by a symbol of the telephone .
our creativity comes from , not from the inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s not my fault .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see the limb there , a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s <unk> out of the limb .
our study of solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to an understanding of the atomic structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single nucleus , with <unk> , that &apos;s the one that atoms circle .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think , you know , you can finally <unk> the <unk> ideas for us to <unk> our place in the universe and really the value of our planet .
that &apos;s here . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and every click on each other and every touch of the screen is how <unk> and <unk> <unk> our personal information all over our way through the digital forest .
when our daughter sat down at the <unk> , i asked them , &quot; is it worth a lot of value to musical competence ? &quot;
well , we can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so <unk> and talked to my 27th birthday , i decided i was not going to talk about a day for a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ...
and i explained to the help of a friend who understand my sign , that i was john francis was that i didn &apos;t speak , and that was the last time that someone was going to translate my language .
well , i applaud my backpack again .
i started to speak again because i was <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was thinking on every birthday of my silence , but never my decision to use my decision to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried that i was going to be sent back and sent back .
i felt so powerless because i had gotten so much food in america , but my father had died of starvation .
but i firmly believe that your gesture of love and others can save the lives of another joseph and can transform thousands of other byproducts , which still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for building buildings , but this was much more powerful than i expected , and to make it easy , and as an industrial <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t work , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich people , the government , contractors .
and then the next year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in the japan in japan .
so i wonder what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born in the womb .
so what fetuses are actually learning about the particular language that is spoken in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it &apos;s a combination of the influences that are so distinctive and weird as the woman itself .
why is malnutrition in the womb of illness ?
but you can also see <unk> with other eyes .
this trust in the <unk> is essential to any kind of <unk> .
the audience will be in <unk> , which are quite logical , but not with the match what is happening in front of her eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it makes us even smile .
you may remember this as the <unk> <unk> , okay , at the time , as the greatest deal of all the time .
if you &apos;re a high animal at the time , and somebody says , &quot; what do you mean , &quot; what do you mean to the <unk> of hunger ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad app ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue , that strategy play a role .
for me , all the music was .
now , if i took my software , the camera &apos;s camera , and she &apos;s <unk> the spot of the <unk> in relative to the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a whiteboard .
i remember that the poor people needed a little <unk> -- eat , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t had .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now , since i heard him speak , i was very excited .
i was not even asked a donation , which was my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving a chance to give you an opportunity to get a partnership , a partnership , which is based on a traditional kind of <unk> , crazy <unk> .
it &apos;s a very <unk> combination , a very powerful combination .
now right now , <unk> is still at the beginning , and it &apos;s <unk> to me , it &apos;s very clear that it &apos;s just a vehicle , only a tool .
what &apos;s the future of humankind ?
now i turn to the second big question : are we alone , or are we living in the universe ?
the answer to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here &apos;s photographs of myself .
the rate is doubling every 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> knows that &apos;s the <unk> law .
but what about them ? what is it going to do with you ?
they float around the sky across the sky and occasionally take some people for trials that parents wouldn &apos;t agree with .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
earlier generations could not do these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was <unk> millions of years ago in the form of <unk> million years ago .
we can learn very much about it .
and i can see <unk> and try to protect my child , because with such a child , you don &apos;t leave a minister alone .
and secondly , she tells us that she had a <unk> gang , but some <unk> <unk> on the trees of trees .
until now , our knowledge came through our ancestors in principle of adults , because the fossils , the <unk> , were missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> examines the origin of humankind in the great ethiopia , and he &apos;s talking about how he &apos;s found the oldest skeleton of a spontaneous child , and what we can learn to learn about our human history .
and if all the rules are supposed to be the rules , of course , you need an effective system for the <unk> and <unk> , because how we &apos;ve been found in everything , in all of you have control control .
it &apos;s going to be a high seas because the continent of <unk> <unk> was except .
we need to work locally , but also <unk> <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of <unk> and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
that &apos;s probably a pretty good idea .
and to say , i &apos;m a journalist , i &apos;m a journalist , so i &apos;m not going to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
so i think i think we all need to think about it , whether we want our reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life , and for everything that &apos;s going on .
it looks like oil oil .
the symptoms of complex are that you have the strong and <unk> opinion to have the right solution , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and earning a lot of money .
it &apos;s more than higher than the <unk> of americans .
we &apos;re going to try . probably everything goes wrong .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
<unk> was trying to do it again , but he could never prove the idea .
i claim that our approach is not sustainable .
china wants to have reached that in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s going to be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to be pretty soon -- with certainty in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than capable of transcending it .
and here they come into the game .
and what we need to think about is this : when you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed that we owe this debt to our children , but it turns out to you .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what level of development is the cell .
this isn &apos;t amazing ?
all we have is <unk> .
they &apos;re going to be able to listen to you to focus your sensitivity or a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
that &apos;s not a thousand years in the distance .
we should outlaw these cheap , simple <unk> , and nobody can use to use their kids . &quot;
and here &apos;s what we can see .
we cannot risk to losing the trust of customers .
he &apos;s only got 500 lbs and could have given to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a giant jar of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when they &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things that we &apos;re all talking about -- is more less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web , only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine that we &apos;re <unk> is a <unk> , a human brain , if we look at the rate that is growing up in 30 years of six billion years .
now , it &apos;s not that -- if you &apos;re doing a table and things like this , a word document , they &apos;re not part of the web , but they &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to take the broader senses of the machine . &quot; in a certain sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want <unk> .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
thirdly , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week of a week , i was convinced that the second <unk> of jesus christ had been the sun , and that was the sun that i was being prepared for god and prepared to become his <unk> .
these are the dead dead of <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes everything logically .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , like we line things .
this is a project that we just completed in <unk> for a giant platform that came directly from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that are going to evolve .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset because it &apos;s a combination of more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are contributing to the <unk> young people .
and finally one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of them is about his neighbors .
so , we have to pay for numbers .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage because we can impact our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a <unk> brain .
and this <unk> is very , very important , because there &apos;s <unk> .
we have learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .

now , we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest , the longest , in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians are still going to be like to bite , &quot; in the <unk> apple , without the mine , they can &apos;t hide their insecurity .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a <unk> man , a little chaotic man , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
but interestingly enough , this is a future , where society <unk> is a pair of <unk> of capitalism , namely , how to integrate the dna <unk> innovation in society by creating things and those things that work , and those things work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new findings that i &apos;ve been working on , about the relationship between the structure of the language that they &apos;re talking about , and their propensity for saving .
and if i want to talk correctly , it &apos;s <unk> me , constantly thinking about it .
well , this is a unified theory .
so , squeeze this device , you can stick this device with your <unk> hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for the future .

so the coffee cup is the coffee cup , or the cup of being , one of the society used to maintain the public health .
interestingly , complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple as you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> remarks , an example and two .
and i don &apos;t want to stop the details , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of what we have .
have you started to do that ?
and what comes from the things that we &apos;ve been talking about , what kind of jimmy talked about what our new kind of organization is , or better words : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?

it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to devote their <unk> to somebody &apos;s team , and in fact , a team of new zealand and spain .

he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman to true to my anonymity . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t have a set of data , so it turned out that she was moved into a different town and took a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i &apos;ve been studying human behavior based on everything , from genes , from genes , and <unk> , to the <unk> .
some of you have a few of them . and it &apos;s about gender .
this was one of those cases , because there was no violence under their ancestors , but my father had already been .
they &apos;re similar to each other as you can be .
by the way , i get an email tomorrow , which is that we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that may be the least known .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why the nuclei together , they should be <unk> , with a <unk> computer -- why dna is the shape that you &apos;ve now had .
the comparison is that the people in this room represent the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really so so that with this theory that seem the physical <unk> at the time , and a perfectly wonderful prediction , and the model was not created by the goal that this happens , but it seems to do it .
they made this civilization , this beautiful image , which is turning into light into light , and it allows you to see the civilization from the space .
another big insight came from a survey of wayne at 2010 university university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the <unk> <unk> player .
in a very similar trial in germany , researchers used to measure <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and after they had <unk> <unk> to <unk> smiles .
&quot; because the colors that you &apos;ve inherited , not the european standard , &quot; he replied .
&quot; safer ? why ? were there more policemen ? &quot;
so we built the light out of the bright people people who had to think of <unk> , to think that they were traveling abroad , when they were <unk> to the cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it . &quot;
all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs and <unk> <unk> for mobile phones .
an illustration of the overall power of technology is happening in kibera .

in the streets of the environment , <unk> batteries , batteries and bread .
this flow of time is embedded in everything : in the <unk> of a <unk> , in the <unk> that <unk> the rose .
read an interview with a writer ?
and again , if i look at the great bear , i remember how i <unk> myself as a kid to highlight his head , and i feel back to his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen again how creative technology can be , and in our lives , we can choose the solutions , innovations and choices , and choose the flow of the time that &apos;s the flow of time , but again .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee camp , they had to <unk> soldiers , who was at the age of the older brother , take the nine , take a child soldier .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want , out of the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> because i don &apos;t <unk> my emotions .
thank you .
almost all life on earth is about five times away .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why would that matter ?
so theoretically , we can grow each organ out of some of some cell .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the bottom line .
so if the rotors rotate at the same speed , the robot is floating around .
and you can see how robust control is .
and he does that , while he <unk> obstacles .
they take their neighbors .
so this shows that we double the <unk> , triple to be able to triple , triple a thousand times , to make them teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can even figure out where he wants .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much so much , and i want to expand it up here , consciousness is open and change in honeybees .
this is a huge problem for a lot of years , basically since the late 1980s , the <unk> of the <unk> , the many different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
they don &apos;t experience that .
they take the chefs for their dishes , and the honey -- there &apos;s <unk> -- they &apos;re using the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want it .
okay , now the question is : why is this ?
of course , we also have , especially in the last decade , done the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before that many people were not aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of them don &apos;t know that our bread was not the european invention .
and particularly the meat <unk> in <unk> and china is <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> for most people , and there &apos;s not a lot of farmers among them that reputation <unk> of them , not to be <unk> the environment , <unk> the environment .
all it depends on .
and so while i finished my bread , i &apos;m <unk> , and i &apos;m trying to burn it , and i &apos;m not trying to burn the hands .
and also , it &apos;s got to hold for a long time to keep the tools that allow them to be able to fix materials and <unk> .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyze and testing , and developed a new technology , meaning the quantitative <unk> .
because i hope that you take this today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar made a film about her , <unk> queen , who should you see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is <unk> as <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient who was at the back of the century -- he needed to get a bypass , decided , but for this .
i like this slide because you can talk about what people really motivated to change , and what not .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . american food is even more fat than ever , and even more carbs , but the percentage is lower , but the actual number higher , the goal is to reduce it .
one of the <unk> studies found that 70 percent of the people were clogged , 65 percent of the people , 65 percent of the people had a bad breath , 54 percent -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything is that intimacy is <unk> .
i hope it &apos;s not .
the film is based on a <unk> of f. scott <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had a lot of passion to get the <unk> and technology .
so we prospered from motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinite .
and these are the data that we get from , and they &apos;re used to use the model .
and this was the finished image that was used in the film .
this was a very , very early rehearsal .
and we found this , right in the state of karnataka .
and it &apos;s got a <unk> .
people of <unk> are going to overcome these <unk> , <unk> past that they lived for their lives .
we were to <unk> -- two bedouin -- two bedouin -- and imagine this , this is a sea of sand , 40 degrees celsius , a water bottle , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best <unk> animal in the world . &quot;
and they use it as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another film .
i don &apos;t know until my body temperature 40 degrees fahrenheit degrees fahrenheit degrees fahrenheit , and enough to be a <unk> .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
they start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea .
but how would it like you would never know if you knew the next day , whether you see a living in the world , your shoulders in the clouds , or whether you &apos;re sitting there in the bottom of the wallpaper , or if you sit down there ?
who could sleep in that night ?
but , you know , you know , judy &apos;s <unk> at your age , given a film that was <unk> da <unk> <unk> the french army , <unk> <unk> -- no wait , i mean he had invented the prius ?
at the end , they &apos;re sitting in a tree and a <unk> hand .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but if you take those two columns , you probably wouldn &apos;t be much more .
and also , we have the problem with elephants the problem , that you can &apos;t build a construction that would be too hard to have an elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand the emotion of the other and sharing . &quot;
so now we explore more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
the test doesn &apos;t take good for them .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher , he wrote to us that was impossible to have a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazy crazy thing , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot of news .
the last decade i spent with that pain and humiliation , i hope , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> thing .
and i have to say thank god .
so i listened to , in a way , it was successful .
over the years , it can create serious <unk> .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy lives me almost .
and i think that many of you are sharing this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientific , and they were <unk> , but they &apos;re not the whole story .

... a priest ?
lastly , another group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of people in the world are <unk> .
right on the left , how many ? okay .

actually all the young people in the city ...
somebody who &apos;s sitting next to you -- that &apos;s okay in a <unk> , but you &apos;d sit on a <unk> , and someone else would sit next next to you , they would be <unk> .
so the dalai lama always says -- he says , &quot; if you &apos;re in his mind , it &apos;s because you realize that you see yourself and your pain and more of the pain to be a pain for your own intelligence .
now , if you take this beautiful thing , the <unk> of us showed us , and she was terrified of the <unk> .
a man in front of a tank was a picture that became a symbol of the resistance of the resistance .
but what would they do not even do anything if you had the modern communications to make a sense that was wrong with the wrong thing that was going to be done immediately ?
combine the power of a global ethic with our ability to communicate on global level and globally to organize globally with the challenges that we &apos;re now in now and the largely global nature .
in the museum of the kids in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of the kids &apos; museum of life that were left to live than in the process of rwanda , a million people died .

we slow down to see the spikes in action .
mark cutkosky , one of my partners , one of my partners , is an exceptional engineer , which was developed a technique called <unk> <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> straight into artificial foot .
you look almost like aliens . and the secret to what they stick with , they &apos;re toes .
so here we move this down .
these <unk> structures allow the spines , <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , hard surfaces .
so hannah &apos;s a long time of beautiful songs that are serving as <unk> and males as females allow females to find each other and choose a mate .
so if the dolphins are less than 20 feet apart , they need to make less than half of the time that they &apos;re making their whistles whistles .
if we think of the marine trials for animals as dolphins think , we need to be aware of the consequences of our interventions , which we think we were quite harmless .
according to the <unk> , the marine technologies have made these systems to experience what the scientists could hear .
they &apos;re just hearing the low frequencies .
if males and females are using this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , imagine , imagine what the implications of the world would have been preserved .
how ships can be done . they found out that with a better <unk> rate of noise that noise could be reduced to 90 percent .
they <unk> the speed by 50 percent .

you have all options available .
we observe a continual rise of men .
and obviously , it &apos;s a hundred .
with initiatives like the $ 100 laptop laptop , it <unk> me on the idea that we have a whole new generation of people using the old <unk> computer .

and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you very much for you . we &apos;re all grateful . &quot;

what &apos;s more data about data ?
there &apos;s something that we think , it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the <unk> as very intelligent , not in a human .
in humans , we have the <unk> part of the <unk> part of the <unk> portion of the neocortex , the nature has made this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re looking down there and say , &quot; what &apos;s i see ?
not like a <unk> . not at least like a <unk> .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need some police , we need a military , but only defense .
you can see it . &quot;
they &apos;ve been working because she was the election of the election .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when you closed the door , grandmother said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no .
it &apos;s like , by hand .
this group three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
it &apos;s made of learning english and learning this as a foreign language .
and the computer was already , and in one of three people .
if you think differently as the employers of the u.s. , who actually were part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
we went through the experiment with the same group , but we added a second one between the enlightenment of how we deal with the data and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price of that is the birthplace of paradise .
and they moved to each other and then threatening to each other and they left their arms up to each other .
we &apos;re really good at speech and security and health and health , we &apos;re really bad at nature .
then you ask yourself a little coach , the <unk> , <unk> breath for <unk> breath .
i don &apos;t really think of emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to peer in people &apos;s minds and figure out what to offer .
they own <unk> humility .
that &apos;s what the unconscious is <unk> .
we found it between <unk> , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many men .
where does your journey start ?
and it &apos;s not normal to live in a home home .
what was my challenge ?
you need your empathy .
lexicography : dictionaries .
well , first of all , i blame the queen , because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- see when someone thinks there &apos;s a place , and then it doesn &apos;t find it on the map , then he thinks , &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , if we think words are tools that we use to make sense of our thoughts , how do you know that they &apos;re better than a hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different words for &quot; set . &quot;
and then this mike is <unk> . mike <unk> lives in britain .
i was all the time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
so i get a chair .
and to make a long story short , here i landed .
and with that piece of play , while this three days , you start to understand , why am i listening to me all this <unk> stuff ?
you may have heard of a ted speakers and we can get the conversation during the year , and next year , next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a sort of precise <unk> <unk> that could fold in the <unk> .
there was unsure that was already <unk> , and it was technically technically unable to find the channel .
instead of <unk> the <unk> , you &apos;re alert to them .
and , &quot; you can trust . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this is a work of a <unk> people .
we debate about the phrase , &quot; what the world needs , &quot; right ? right ?
and until now , it &apos;s just three <unk> of this -- coal and gas , <unk> , that almost everywhere -- and nuclear power .
we &apos;ve gotten the russian warheads we &apos;ve been transformed into electricity .
<unk> emissions are the equivalent of the greenhouse gases of all greenhouse gases and particles , the warming will cause , and to co2 co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons is the distribution of nuclear weapons with the distribution of nuclear power , because we know that india and pakistan <unk> <unk> nuclear nuclear weapons in <unk> developed .
for wind , the area is much larger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- just one or two voices are required to <unk> global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewable sources .
i &apos;ve been worried about over 10 years .
thank you very much .
that was -- my motivation was from apollo .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some fewer people , and the available technology that will allow us to allow us to allow us to explore space .
26 groups of seven countries took the competition to give each between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring it to the space station .
and the advantage for the sponsors is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would they be surprised to us ?
so that means that can make up the surfaces . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can put this new algorithmic order in a column .
and what i didn &apos;t know at the time , because we only saw the outside the outside , the area of the column , within the column , which was quite surprising .
inspired by the process of cell cell , michael <unk> , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms of space . no person could design it by hand , but you could build it , and you could build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this image here -- lots of shapes dancing here for them .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip <unk> even the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people in the room , many of them are in the same position as i &apos;m .
so i think women will be leaders in our society because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations to preserve our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve discovered that since recently has more people like youtube and social networks to make their stories look like their stories , their photos and share their own histories with their own voices .
at the same time , we invite them to explore and explore our part of the world .
so i became more or less than nothing .
so i thought , &quot; well , if i make these ants a pair of apartments , you draw there . &quot;
this was &quot; <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly <unk> , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i <unk> it around , and shaped the <unk> .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very <unk> job , but the best things come in little <unk> .
they expect by their employees , they do what they asked them to do , if they did the job , they can do some additional .
there is this absolute concentration of his , absolute <unk> of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defines the primary properties of the divine .
my <unk> body flew in the one direction , my <unk> bike .
i asked myself all the <unk> that i probably wouldn &apos;t be able to do with you , the <unk> , which i didn &apos;t get to look at was the friends that i didn &apos;t want to look like , the <unk> that i could do with them .
because you don &apos;t need it .
and if you <unk> them from the back of the wind , you can just get it over and <unk> it in the dirt . &quot;
and 20 years ago , the doctors had taken my leg and hoped , and there was 15 <unk> of death .
as i became more and more humane -- and at that point in my life , i was probably a 14 pounds easier than i was now .
and nobody represented this modern <unk> in my eyes more than david black .
running upright , you know , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he is the president of the international commission for <unk> , which is the least <unk> name i ever heard .
and he was born , and he was born , and it was really an amazing <unk> of him .
so as soon as i was trying to approach the piano , i became severely <unk> .
and at the end of the end , you were so quick that things like the flight of the flight of the flight machine ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t applaud that .
they &apos;re fighting for their own lives in this forest , in a world , in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that hasn &apos;t been <unk> , in a world that &apos;s not <unk> .
so we know that today , that they &apos;re capable of making the research possible for absolutely impossible when i started .
the long loving support for the mother and the mother that &apos;s developed during this long childhood , and the siblings , can be preserved all the lives , and that can be up to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the giant camp in the forest need to be meat , and that &apos;s the case that they &apos;ve been engaged in <unk> , and they &apos;ve lived in their beautiful lives so many hundreds of thousands of years .
yesterday , someone said that .
now , there are now in every state , and the problems in florida are different than that in new york .
do you want to get me down and <unk> me down here ?
there are politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is pretty much the same , but with a few dozen different kinds of molecules of molecules -- so a <unk> reduction of complexity , but still trying to create something <unk> .
it &apos;s even very <unk> . if you form yourself , you don &apos;t really do anything .
now , where you &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells protocells .
so we &apos;re looking at the self-assembly of these bodies that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blob in these black mud -- these <unk> , very complex , organic black sludge .
in his lab , martin <unk> <unk> &quot; protocells , &quot; which is experimental <unk> of chemicals who behave like living cells . his work shows how life could be done at first ... and maybe elsewhere .
this is a <unk> photograph to lead your tadpole for a walk .
what did that -- where did you know ? they took it .
but if we did that every time -- every fire fire , we could redefine the emergency .
soot is the <unk> of the <unk> lungs , <unk> in her pretty pink lungs , and that &apos;s associated with .
the birds could jump from one another .
you can <unk> some news from him . you can talk to him .
but these flocks , you know , is a great toll of our planet .
next to the next is the skin cells and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working for thousands of years with <unk> , starting with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re going to research in the world of our research , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people to own that .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge amount of energy to create mobile fuels .
if we can see the <unk> future , it can also be others .
you had to survive .
and we certainly introduced to our school school school department to get funding and sustain support .
because why would our students drive so far away from their driving ?
it became a book , and then a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but in this image , you see how we started building the <unk> , which was going to be a big bang in brazil .
as a time for me , my <unk> came to start , i studied the newly <unk> field in the <unk> field .
if you look at the south atlantic , you see the expansion of new york city like it was once , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the <unk> places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> places .
maybe there was a <unk> there .
it &apos;s a lot of power to combine science and visualizing them that are creating pictures , and it &apos;s like to see the images of the <unk> .
and we have a really dramatic level in our society right now .
so i don &apos;t have to go into that .
you &apos;re going to be the pristine , of course .
this is a <unk> building .
one example that we all know is that the cell phone . right ?
and it &apos;s all about that question -- of course , in a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are elements that help us do it .
seriously -- clap -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> looks a sustainable future .
you could mean that this could be a big problem for a law , but it doesn &apos;t seem to make it very much <unk> .
but if you &apos;re a lot of high-quality expression and sold , that &apos;s not okay .
some of the things that we share , we &apos;ve made out of things that we found , and every single one option is caused by this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very <unk> , <unk> , expensive education in india , and that made me broke down .
and i thought , i start a barefoot college -- college college just for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how to be <unk> , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , if you &apos;re arrested , if an animal is sick .
does it happen to be tension at the middle of the schools , it &apos;s the presence of teachers and parents to <unk> the teachers and the parents in front of the village and saying , &quot; give you your hands . &quot;
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m not , mister president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> created one of the largest , dynamically <unk> computers in the world for this kind of <unk> .
you can see the <unk> <unk> along the <unk> of which we &apos;ve created as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
and interestingly , there &apos;s data from these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i think it &apos;s physically physically , financially , mentally mentally mentally , mentally , in almost every other way . &quot; &quot; i &apos;m not a minute .
he <unk> him the cash , and of course , ray <unk> six months later , the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used in the experiment that i used to be used to report prints pictures of paintings .
we collected our materials , went out in the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they had two pictures , and they had two beautiful <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> for you for them , and we said , &quot; what would you be ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> and saying , &quot; you know , we give a <unk> , and we can make it on two different ways .
<unk> <unk> the big car and the air <unk> .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t go . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not coming from the <unk> of <unk> , but further back in a time , before we <unk> stories on <unk> , or <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the sort of <unk> roof , you know , you know .
and so we left my father off his father , because i knew he would kill me when i let them go alone . so let &apos;s go into the car .
&quot; and i had a blue uniform and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to put in there ? because if i didn &apos;t make a <unk> , to <unk> me -- enough metaphors for your taste ? — could it be that i never come out again .
you can see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret <unk> .
she says , &quot; ma , you need to look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree with the little old lady , <unk> ! &quot;
she &apos;s up the car . &quot;
i was really terrified .
so what &apos;s the social result ?
where can i go today and who together ?
and if we have , we will decide , we will decide how many miles we &apos;re driving , where we live and work .
smart <unk> at the center of the center and you can see exactly where your bus is out on the road , and when it comes , and they can buy it in real time .
i want to be the wireless , <unk> <unk> . and i challenge that the network of open standards for anyone to be accessible to anyone .
and they came up here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came with a mental illness in touch , knowledge , what can be for a challenge .
i said that i wanted to tell the story , i wanted to share with you the three a bit of great parts and i wanted to leave you with one <unk> .
because they all were three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier &apos;s just a authentic person , and it &apos;s about authenticity .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sleep .
j it &apos;s so many things that have been there .
and i thought it was weird to speculate as if it was a competition that &apos;s a competition .
well , it &apos;s predominantly a white , rich rich , rich <unk> , who didn &apos;t represent the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a <unk> .
people <unk> over two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of <unk> about the <unk> of the new yorker , which i thought was very emotional .
because looking at four platforms along the <unk> -- which is an enhanced version of a <unk> version -- we knew that it had to be <unk> , to respond to <unk> conditions , and to respond to the expansion of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : i was an honor .
and i know that children suffer every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here were <unk> and a <unk> <unk> , most of us , most of us , in a period of several hours , fully <unk> .
you have to know about problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom was a helmet helmet for 20 dollars a good way to keep a 100,000 escape .
and that &apos;s not true , but tony blair happened to wake up in 2005 in 2005 , and of course , &quot; i &apos;ve been described , &quot; and he was being described .
in other words , they have a shared and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s happening in <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are obliged to offer patents to offer tickets to least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the community companies to <unk> their patents and make them available .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> . people were sitting in the brooklyn sun , afternoon at very high distances , and they didn &apos;t think .
they can adjust everything to worry about their well-being .
and he offers all these services , <unk> , shouting , and so little things that you &apos;re just going to do online , but for people that he connects to the digital world .
and the question was , &quot; how do you do that teacher .
let &apos;s see what he does .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick in his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very large .
well , <unk> had a <unk> on our studies .
well , when we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people will take a different structural position within the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has one of the two communities that are put in a particular way , on the left , and they get <unk> , the soft and dark .
so to <unk> this , let me zoom out for a second .
now , older is not easy .
in the same circumstances , older people have older their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more on positive information than on negative information .
we spend life .
they let me wish , &quot; tonight i &apos;m going to perform this <unk> for this girl in this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i said , honestly , i don &apos;t know exactly what happens when i dance .
they have brother and uncles and uncles and me over a period of five years over time .
<unk> : the second treaty of the fort laramie treaties with the great sioux nation and the lakota of the lakota , the holy black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie demanded was that at least three quarters of the <unk> sign would be to land .
they were the treaties .
the <unk> is eight times as high as the american average .
so what are us ?
and today , the child mortality has declined since 1960 about 24 percent today .
you can either get it as a pill or a syringe . you need to take it every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we do , like this , with people .
but basically , it makes a lot of sense .
you know , are you smarter than a <unk> ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is that car looks safe .
now they &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depended on it , i would like to use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
that &apos;s something different than actually making an effective ad .
which is nothing new .
light cells become dark .
we do it for our clients .
we &apos;re going to let the sun be .
now , logic -- logical -- logical , logical , you know , you &apos;re going to move from this position to move .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . if every time -- another person -- not always the same answers .
so if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some <unk> .
so here , i have to look at the beginning of the beginning , so i have to follow my maps during the <unk> -- oh , we &apos;ve got to start -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what do i want to use ? the queen or five ?
lg : but you can see the hand .
wait a moment , wait for some card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , right ? zoe : yeah .
here &apos;s all the cards -- here &apos;s all the cards -- right ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly -- five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i was back , i was making my entire company a <unk> . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have a musical ear , you could not turn off the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s happening here .
and i always tell my students , &quot; if you hold a deceptive , you always get one eyebrow , you know . &quot;
imagine the person and follow it all the way from b to e , and you &apos;ll hear it all the way to tell you what &apos;s written .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , since 20 years , and suddenly a realization .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old . her brother was eight , her parents lost her parents .
so , ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the world &apos;s fastest , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for the tasks of the 21st century , this is the <unk> , don &apos;t work -- often , often , often , often harm .
think about your own work .
the standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of a whole new trial for our businesses .
this one day of intense autonomy has led to a whole array of <unk> <unk> that might never have existed .
do it , because you do it .
the aluminum is being used by its light .
in a series of 55 bullets , they &apos;re <unk> , every sphere and their distances are proportionate , to the extent to these little earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows in the other direction .
this has developed a lot of <unk> in many <unk> .
the <unk> on the object would probably be a high <unk> image of the earth .
but they &apos;re always making those 10 percent or more , which is most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a <unk> dollar dollar dollars .
charitable organizations have to <unk> , bold , big expectations of trying to try and try to fear that at failure .
so what should you do ?
the overhead is the overhead .
dan <unk> : our thinking about charity
and then there was the <unk> audience , yes , that &apos;s their part to the music .
people who made these <unk> , the <unk> , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about the <unk> of music as it is written , not around . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what is the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , the authority is available when it &apos;s needed . it &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is about the process .
as a marketer , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and about what we could do from here .
there are 98 percent globally .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes really joy .
they think about it , if you should move it forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition , we would have to invent these entire collective infrastructure for first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and to a certain extent , the games they &apos;re playing right now is the games that are so very , so you can &apos;t recognize what the real biggest challenge are .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not to stand up with this great challenge .
and even if you &apos;re just living in the same way you could get access to it .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> , when i went to visit <unk> <unk> , and i was trying to decide my life in my life , and i was trying to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young woman who i knew was that sex may be as good for the five senses as well .
in the end , according to great sex , all five senses at an extreme level .
of course , the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
we &apos;re all born as an artist .
if you have a conversation , the child has to come up with the next answer to <unk> what it was .
but their parents tell you , &quot; it &apos;s going to pull everything from the waves . &quot;
but kids are usually making art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
but as a teacher rarely find .
in <unk> , there &apos;s always people called &quot; <unk> california &quot; or &quot; hotel california . &quot;
right in this minute , we can take the tv off . <unk> them out of the internet , stand up and start to do something .
the students fall in a kind of <unk> .
he said it was his profile . &quot; and what are you ? &quot; actors , &quot; &quot; actors , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with that point .
there will be more powerful storms and greater flooding .
if you &apos;re going to be a global warming .
but the second one is exactly the expectation .
the economic consequences are almost inconceivable .
a big part of the species will be endangered .
now , if you happen a car accident , it &apos;s imperative that we don &apos;t just save the stuntman , but the crew .
they used to be used to be used as much more <unk> . once it was anything you had .
but today we &apos;re using a <unk> .
more it &apos;s not , a <unk> .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> from the united states is doing something very incredible .
one of the difficulties in this height , if you go to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 <unk> , you can actually use oxygen .
they made a puppet for him , exactly what he looked like .
we expect other people to expect that maybe the <unk> or the <unk> will tell you , &quot; you have to put somebody in a suit that is not <unk> with the airplane . &quot;
there were three <unk> <unk> -- not true ? -- that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
and the girl replied , &quot; you know , you know it . &quot;
the problem is to stay up with you , as you &apos;re growing up , and i &apos;m now convinced that we don &apos;t grow into creativity , but we &apos;re going to be <unk> . or we &apos;re going to <unk> .
all around the world .
the whole system was invented -- all around the world , there was no public education education in front of the 19th century .
the brain is not divided into spaces .
they made natasha , they made <unk> and jazz , they were dancing modern and contemporary dances .
the front festival is running very good . using a <unk> press for you would die .
let &apos;s just say value for <unk> .
dubai is to be like a hand that wants to bring it to the things that i want to get in the gang .
before i go back in the middle east , i &apos;d like to leave <unk> as a <unk> one of the biggest <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s also the <unk> .
all right . they &apos;re disorders of behavior , and they are disorders of the mind .
we don &apos;t all have facts . we don &apos;t even know what the tools are going to be , or what we need to look for is to be able to be able to be able to be able to get that different behavior .
how are you going to scale it up ? &quot;
three are all the same in the same time , although they &apos;re all the same in different context , one of the two things that i think like , because i like these books , because they have something very special to themselves .
the kids have taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that the content is more important .
i was transformed by my children .
howard is doing this experiment , and when he gets the data , he draws a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that no beautiful <unk> makes .
this was his <unk> . he was obsessed with obsessed .
howard don &apos;t believe that there is this at all .
people are always saying , when you ask them , how they wish their coffee .
a <unk> with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so it &apos;s it . and why did we like that ?
and he was <unk> a couple of times , and spent most of his career in the bottom , and ended up at management . he was the general manager of &quot; oakland . &quot;
we all know what happened as millions of women over decades given centuries of the <unk> of symptoms , until we got a giant survey , done by national institutes , found out of national institutes .
thank you .
but dad <unk> , and he didn &apos;t want us to do that .
but there &apos;s also a gray between between .
these are four really different ways to see the world . i named them .
what &apos;s interesting is , once you see it -- and by the way -- this is from <unk> -- showing all the artifacts of modern comics : <unk> <unk> simple <unk> , <unk> <unk> &apos;s simple line with on the left .
and that was what i proposed : we might be able to make comics , at an infinite canvas , and on the line , and on the line and in <unk> .
this is by daniel <unk> <unk> in britain .
maybe all of you have been clear for all of you , but for me , so often i met exactly this very hard day , i had these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> challenge .
this is honestly , and it &apos;s true , and the reason why <unk> is such a sustainable idea of <unk> .
if you think your baby is gay or <unk> , you should give it to the adoption .
<unk> political solution was a political solution to pray from texas to pray .
this is called &quot; <unk> <unk> the sun . &quot;
i want to start a little different tonight , because i want to ask you to jump on the mainland and jump to the open sea .
they were very short after the <unk> of dinosaurs about 65 million years ago when whales had springy legs , and they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and how do you do that ?
the <unk> <unk> takes the molas , if you come into the bay , they put the fins , they turn into a kind of <unk> , and then she throws around .
i &apos;ll show you our last data .
and the most exciting thing was that all their love and their interest to the oceans in the oceans .
as you can see here , this is a <unk> <unk> .
you don &apos;t hear anything every day .
<unk> <unk> .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the people who sit in jail .
she told him it , and he was <unk> the first <unk> on what we call the <unk> .
because of course nobody gets a <unk> .
so why don &apos;t we interfere with this problem in the world ?
goodbye , mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last statement ?
never , that &apos;s impossible . no , no , no , no , no . it &apos;s not possible .
you could overcome the whole thing with the addition .
von neumann , a <unk> and a mathematician from the army took everything together . they needed a space to build them .
and the <unk> and the output worked at first .
&quot; aha ! &quot; they found out that it was a hallucination .
i know if i have to leave . &quot;
he made the machine all the night , if someone remembers stephen wolfram reminds the whole one .
now , we &apos;re spending 50 years now -- it &apos;s a way of force animation animation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes , i &apos;m going to talk about four americans who are still alive , die because of their diet .
that &apos;s a global problem .
<unk> city .
and he &apos;s got the snout full of it . he &apos;s suffering , his friends , his friends and his community .
they want ... they want to control themselves .
you know it remained for long , long time in this tight sense .
we don &apos;t teach our children .
and most kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , doesn &apos;t matter .
in fact , a lot of wonderful things are happening , if we just look back now .
misha glenny : ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of the <unk> hacker is <unk> <unk> &apos;s hackers .
the web is all together , and it &apos;s going to give you a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses information doesn &apos;t use information for cash .
he explained to me as he was in 2003 and 2004 like he went in new york , 30,000 dollars from the atm machine , 30,000 dollars from the atm machine , using <unk> cards .
he was being born in <unk> in a stable and respect korean family , his obsession with him as a teenager led him to <unk> him .
and most of the time , with the script and <unk> , showed no real social skills in the world -- just the web .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all about the market in the market , and what the market is , particularly , is number of the great demographic demographic <unk> .
and we &apos;ve also found a lot of examples of deaths that are transformed into all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .
and i ended up expecting the streets of roads through the mall of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped inspire , that eight of 13 local officials have <unk> plans in <unk> plans to be <unk> .
the bach &apos;s <unk> was <unk> .
their inhabitants are different than independently <unk> , but they &apos;re less <unk> than cities .
&quot; his vagina to look , &quot; she said , &quot; is an <unk> . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about gender , which is a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way that exists really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning of meaning our bodies in our heads -- that these <unk> created a division that &apos;s often created .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s how much of happiness with happiness and agnes .
maybe it &apos;s in my <unk> south carolina , which is not much smaller than that <unk> <unk> , and once you dreamed of a future as a <unk> country .
well , maybe he was too clear , because he stayed where he was , even long after the procedure , through the nazis , and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .
and he received the same answer : &quot; bring you the best workers you can find , and if you &apos;re good enough to do it . &quot;
and also clear to us , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; i said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the movie . &quot;
as i said , he <unk> too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the most remote cases and order to do the other day for the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mom went with , during the time of the soviet union .
and when you think it &apos;s no longer , it &apos;s not enough , until you get further .
so what i &apos;d like to try to do -- i hope to illustrate this .
and what i &apos;d like to point out is in the presentation , 50 percent of the u.s. is under the ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles . it &apos;s <unk> miles down miles .
and so we went along along the <unk> in an area beside the <unk> , and there &apos;s the missing heat .
so i started developing a new <unk> <unk> with a <unk> that replaced me , and i don &apos;t need to move into my vehicle .
we &apos;re going to figure out the <unk> .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would give you a child without <unk> control control .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is just hard to access .
when we looked at the impact of the <unk> , andrew , and i decided that we had to increase it for so many people as possible as possible .
what was the special thing about these courses ?
the video will be interrupted every few minutes , and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues in the humanities that there &apos;s no such bad thing .
in particular courses , you can wonder what they &apos;re <unk> and how to help the students are helping to fix it .
we actually see the beginning of either personalized <unk> or <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what if my first thought was a child .
and of course , in our society , it &apos;s mainly about <unk> .
so i have my doubt about the value of influenza science science , like , for example , it &apos;s expected to be <unk> .
so you can understand my surprise , when i got to read the new yorker , alan greenspan , the head of <unk> <unk> , claims , ayn rand , ayn rand .
i think you can do that kind of funny ones that have done , and not about the fact that i don &apos;t have a joke . right ?
i &apos;ve done right now that the ancient times of the <unk> , i tell you .
he said , i needed to pay for him more respect to 18 years to become a good <unk> .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid of this active person .
and i had thought about vera <unk> thoughts about beauty that you heard yesterday , and there in his book says , &quot; there &apos;s no idea of it .
george w. bush : what &apos;s the defense of defense of our security , and what the defense costs of our freedom , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , i wouldn &apos;t have an astronomer on the idea of -- well , or very few , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he <unk> all the time that an experiment is wrong with a particle accelerator , and it could produce a <unk> that destroyed the world .
we need to be <unk> the same way of <unk> .
so we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about it ?
and now the worst .
we spend a lot of money to make sure that we don &apos;t die at a dying of dying , but we &apos;re nearly not there . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that will be .
it &apos;s very , very important because this is the system that came up with the life on the planet , and it &apos;s time to understand it at the time to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we just know just recently .
and this is what the system <unk> , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
anybody who &apos;s going to come after it comes to the database , and you can recall the information that &apos;s needed , for everything that &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;re about to <unk> the wave , the technological possibilities .
there are large amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the <unk> john john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that are our oceans for the global , interactive lab -- and a <unk> over the world of the depth .
so i believe that optimism is going forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the <unk> . you know , often wants to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , are always unexpected .
but i prefer to play something completely completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than the same time that it &apos;s <unk> .
risks from rooms that were never supposed to be as <unk> as they should be in a big town .
there &apos;s the emotions of the victim .
daniel <unk> builds up very big ideas . he calls down 17 terms , that his vision of architecture is essentially <unk> -- raw , daring , <unk> , radically -- and inspiration for every bold creative creative policy .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the cars that size .
so string is a little bit , or will be very few <unk> ?
em : it just has to be . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
and if you bought this capital , and you put it in a <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the roof , and then the <unk> <unk> , which is less than the <unk> .
we &apos;ve almost failed , but we &apos;ve got in 2008 .
it &apos;s like a jet engine .
how to do everything in the world could be an individual innovative ?
look at that .
boy : boy , if you look at our livestock and see a cheetahs like the goats of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous .
we suffer starvation .
and our tradition looks like : in every <unk> , there is an holy fire .
until now , we were working with support the world , the wildlife fund , the very small programs to rise with <unk> .
also very important -- we invest the money in terms of aids and hiv .
<unk> -- over again , a <unk> among many in the world of <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we &apos;re hiding this price behind huge .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> <unk> the <unk> revolution for eating food .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
the science sees the world through the mind , quantitatively , things that can be measured and be described , but they have the art of knowledge and knowledge .
from the plan of a few cameras out there was a plan for three weeks to 25 <unk> .
this is the natural cycle .
it wouldn &apos;t normally be a <unk> photographer to <unk> a photograph of this , right ? but sometimes it &apos;s got to be able to represent the dimensions .
here you see the glacier coming back .
there &apos;s several cameras .
could india be the origin of diffusion of innovation , just as a global center for innovation , just as a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
when we asked to talk to people in these <unk> , what they were working on , they said , &quot; we work on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor , if you &apos;re not a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors who would go for cancer , and in <unk> , <unk> , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a couple of <unk> <unk> for four in the morning .
i said , i know a <unk> message , if i see one .
everyone in our society comes with cancer -- if not personal , then through one beloved of beloved people , a family member , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material is the chromosomes inside of a nucleus .
we have a tumor tumor treating fields over about 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect on all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in six months the tumor is responding , and it &apos;s starting to <unk> .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new <unk> , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and it &apos;s a pipe , and it &apos;s a pipe .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , soon looks like this .
a stream is running a stream or a <unk> through this scene .
it &apos;s called <unk> . in english , we have <unk> and water water .
and you need to fall off .
these are the beautiful stairs we just saw on one of the images .
and <unk> is 27 percent of the time : 600,000 less less than hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in cement that people get out of the <unk> , and they bring them to industrialization and get wealth .
and the countries on the right , you see the <unk> , basically , every country with a <unk> of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of saying three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india was not that right .
buy african products .
but i think that a lot more important problem is that this logic -- that we should be ipods and not ship bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
and then 500 people have stood up there and four of them were chosen to visit the institution , and so they <unk> to teach them .
so now , citizens with urban planning is not necessarily going to change anything about anything , because it still is the dictators that control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> the internet &apos;s worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he left with us younger ones .
because to me , who lived in that time , and in this room , the question was , &quot; do you want ? &quot; either you want ? &quot; either sex or drugs -- and drugs we didn &apos;t do .
i was paralyzed , people .
now , the indians , and now politicians and <unk> , i &apos;m pretty much about the <unk> , <unk> , all the talk about india as new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , tell us all sorts of <unk> stories about countries , regardless of whether they want to come to the patient or not .
but the flash of lightning in our country was pretty slowly <unk> , took it about half an hour to a call .
you can &apos;t understand the dialogues .
this may have <unk> consequences . ok .
and those of you who have the money that you have to be surprised to see how many <unk> <unk> on the <unk> are present to explain the <unk> .
i went home and research a little bit . i found some startling statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath no water .
and now i feel like george bush .
well , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic , and this is one passage i love , and i &apos;d like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would , mother nature would have a problem : how to do everything in the world , we get chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part of the hardest part , which is not obvious , and so i went to the end .
okay ? stop . that &apos;s going to take you .
i don &apos;t know why there &apos;s because there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but no matter they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually suspect that the <unk> probably are very many reasons why we want new things to be very , very fast .
it looked like this . you should see things like this .
bob mckim &apos;s a different -- another version of this exercise made in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned this with the time : you get a lot better , much more creative results , if all the rules hold on the rules .
and suddenly , there was a very productive conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re a little bit skeptical , and i &apos;ll go back to it .
you know , as it feels like it , all of these insecurity , as long as you go back in the corridor , as the physicians in a <unk> case , and you wonder what &apos;s going on .
so it would be safe and we would have a good time , because we have a good time , because we agree with the rules and it would be agreed with it .
we do everything for success . but then , if we &apos;re there , we &apos;re going to believe that we &apos;ve done it . we lean away and just listen to all the things that successfully did succeed .
i was faster , but as much as depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh , my god , &quot; &quot; -- hopefully , forever , the last time in the public .
he made sure everything fit .
it took 900 people participate .
and the second thing is that the people are apparently experiencing an actual connection .
these are questions .
now , as you see in today &apos;s modern democracies , the society , the state , the state of us not only to determine our self , but it also asks us to do it .
it means that we will fulfill our full potential as a human being .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions , by which i wanted to run them today -- the question : what are the intentions , if you design something ?
and so i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> us , we have to give us better ways .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;ll give you one in the fall .
he <unk> them in the right position , <unk> them with his nose and <unk> .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to be there any kind of kind of <unk> to create a lot of force and the speed that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load is a load of forces , and that &apos;s actually a <unk> load cell inside .
this is the <unk> -- there &apos;s the heel , and this is the heel , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> and on the load load .
a very , very <unk> solution for the special problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s the ocean .
i think this is one of the most beautiful classical <unk> that &apos;s ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> , which is just a three-dimensional space .
now look at that -- he just leaves me .
the submersible last year was this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , excuse -- i &apos;m sorry for the obvious example -- is not the right approach to vote .
basically , new york is built on the back of the <unk> , our streets of their streets .
in these eight panels , chambers little <unk> , that will be practically <unk> .
so you walked around in london and was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally created a map of the outbreak of the eruption .
and this happens every second week .
i took her portrait on the top of the chicken .
and in this area of the amazon , there was oil oil .
the other side of the area is <unk> <unk> , which is to stop osama bin laden . that &apos;s <unk> .
this was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me continue to show you the hubble <unk> deep field .
but then you go to jupiter and 40 minutes , and that &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be the part of the beginning of the universe of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that appears in the image of the dark , dark matter .
when you saw this image for the first time , you don &apos;t have a lot of you .
this simulation was taken with 1,000 processors a month just to make it visible .
so we have a resolution that we hope to see this image of the earth &apos;s image , where you can actually recognize the complicated patterns of the earth .
and of course , we &apos;re stressed .
forty-seven percent .
this is crazy . that &apos;s what we &apos;re constantly doing , even in the day .
i got into a cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so that i could almost nothing more .
so i wondered , could be creative , if you want to tangibilitate the limitations ?
this is not going to happen in this morning .
the <unk> is <unk> is duty to <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , and there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> famine , the 1930s of <unk> , killed millions of <unk> . in the 1940s , she looked at the nazis , the nazis , <unk> , <unk> . many women at the time period .
that &apos;s because the grief is around . &quot;
and as a filmmaker filmmaker , the notion of what we had learned in the virtual world about how we had learned in the virtual world , and we could use our identity to live a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to be in a new way .
human relationships are <unk> , messy and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
because at the moment , in which people alone are alone , even for a few seconds , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re panicked , panic , they &apos;re going to turn them into an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in jeopardy , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t know each other with the <unk> that some of our graduate students were predicted , and quite often -- -- quite often , i felt that they were given their predictions on a financial scale .
maybe , because my father is always read at night .
so i went to quiet them in quiet -- but i had to be cold and nurtured it .
and finally , i thought i was a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time .
although you lose losing , no fear of failure , if we &apos;ve got rid of all of the people , because who can give it to people more than anything that he can .
if i &apos;m supposed to call &quot; name , i never know an answer .
i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge was cells .
today in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used for heart disease .
just last month , this technology has been able to show us to show the creation of human <unk> .
and we can map them and turn around 360 degrees and so the kidney , and then we can take this information , and then we can scan this information , and then scan the information using an mri .
i was not going to school at school . i was dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want , i want to . i want this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area is called <unk> .
and connected with these <unk> examples of the world -- from the election of a president , wikipedia , and everything in between the middle of a household , and anything that showed up the power of a lot .
thirdly , <unk> , <unk> issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want the music to play it .
my name is joseph and <unk> in kenya .
we need to <unk> our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late at night , i was driving home with batteries and ice .
together : anybody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , who give up to work in moscow and work to work .
this is a huge amount of spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for <unk> hours , the <unk> of the transcontinental work of the city .
they have <unk> , charts and data .
so that &apos;s what the 18 minutes of the 18 minutes were given to me to speak here , between two and <unk> people who are supposed to be .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things are scattered .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i was part of a technological revolution that would let this dream will be true .
think about it . these guys , these men that were not the same <unk> as i helped me to get involved in their committed support , <unk> <unk> .
at the time , <unk> was just using a <unk> <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read each <unk> .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , in the different english , different versions of being different versions of being different versions : britain , usa , australia had to have different <unk> of harry potter potter .
the <unk> . lifespan has more than doubled than doubled , and it &apos;s increasing increasing at a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you want people like happiness , okay ?
secondly , the new machine age is a good news , because , as soon as the brightest work , we don &apos;t need to do that , and that &apos;s what we need to do .
the societal challenge of these inequality should be <unk> .
the economic playbook is surprisingly lucid and surprisingly straightforward , especially in short .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with adaptive technologies , embedded in a slightly more collective society and supported by an economy that promotes inequality .
over the course of the years , i became increasingly <unk> with this notion of god .
some have <unk> that we can only believe in a god that divides our pain .
in the second time , the line comes &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the <unk> soul of the universe .
by looking at the god inside . by drawing my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things that i started studying was the history of <unk> technology .
we haven &apos;t found <unk> , which was older than 40 years , and the average age of these hunter-gatherer tribes are 20 to 30 .
our bodies have used to use this new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter , the einstein showed showed , and also the modern science of <unk> shows the entropy and information and matter and energy and energy all together .
this is a robot that wants your own plug in , to get more power .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking at a new job .
a great evolution that started billions of years ago , moving through us and continues . and our choice is in the technology , lies really at the power that &apos;s much more powerful than ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we have five classrooms 30 to 40 students .
we put it down all the way down , and we found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had to look at that -- while we &apos;ve got <unk> , somebody said , &quot; you know , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat around the tables and have been waiting .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , specifically for the adults who work at <unk> , who didn &apos;t really know that they were just a toilet .
the teachers that we &apos;re working with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what to do .
about , for instance , 170 tutors have worked with them , and this is how wonderful works works .
and right behind it -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right there &apos;s a little chain , right ?
there &apos;s also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf , which you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in the <unk> , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he gets his cousins .
he gives him an email , he &apos;ll ask you every question you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that &apos;s thought that peace is the end of the fight , and there &apos;s one side that &apos;s thinking that peace is creating the creation of schools and creating jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one thing that &apos;s manual to complete <unk> , did you know ?
on the cape cod , there are <unk> roads , and we &apos;re all driving here .
that &apos;s my baby <unk> . thank you very much .
he was basically , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt badly .
so i met this kind of complications .
i found that these cheetos are very good <unk> .
college is at the university , so it &apos;s number 10 hard .
and of course , in a strange <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is a window of a window to the moment that the street in front of my house was black <unk> , and those whites were <unk> there in the sun .
and i was being amazed by the great presentation of karen armstrong reminds that religion really understood nothing to do with belief , but with behavior .
the <unk> has seen , geographically , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like that , but it has exactly the same size as the united states of the united states , <unk> an area of the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the industrialized world .
we can &apos;t wait to wait the wait for australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we think about the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a couple of images to highlight , i want to look at this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
the rca is really an extraordinary school .
and we &apos;ve been discussing this morning with keith <unk> , which many scientists tend to be able to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , rather than <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s examples of being able to print in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that lets us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to be a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge of that we had to ask as a physicist .
we can press it up . the forces more more than you , but they &apos;re <unk> .
&quot; <unk> 7 . &quot;
and there &apos;s some people in foundations that call this <unk> .
the idea of justice , which shows our life limits and gives us a sense of what &apos;s right in life , what is in life , what we should do is , social justice .
and like that , he &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s a <unk> .
so every week , i would come up with the <unk> , &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> calls like this .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- who said , frankly , it &apos;s not very effective .
now , you get a sense of a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was in 1908 . does nothing . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him from the back line from at all . these are just stars .
in 2005 2005 , nasa started a probe called &quot; deep impact , &quot; which is a part of a portion of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like me , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a <unk> and vote , and therefore we can change our future .
at that time , i led a <unk> , the only independent , to be precise , the only electronic medium in the country .
and i thought that <unk> will survive , and a great business would be , if it was first gone .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it won &apos;t work , you will never see your money , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s all right , we make it , you know , it brings us your business business with what they actually did .
see , we &apos;ve got in east and <unk> with our work , and they went to russia .
after a while , we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve created the idea of making ceos on the open press .
and in this way , you have the funding , so that there &apos;s no <unk> , no blind to find out .
so why does it work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some call that a theory of everything .
so just one example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like one divided through the square of the <unk> between each other objects .
the more symmetry you &apos;ve got , the better is the simplicity and elegance .
one thing that he thought was most of us , most of us , but at his time , it wasn &apos;t for granted .
it doesn &apos;t seem to know the meaning of this course , that they follow <unk> laws and accidents .
but he was <unk> at every time he had books .
from that ambition , he went back to <unk> .
but when he was about to put his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf , because he was shaking a thousand hands of hands during the morning .
not surprisingly , it was just three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i got , the more i understand , what was an incredible privilege to have , with this aging lions so many hours spent so many hours .
and as lincoln told the story , everyone went to the war after britain .
i asked my father to tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what &apos;s the reason for that is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love of the story that allows me to spend a life in the past time .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the proof of the jews that the jews in darfur , after all the years that they were sitting in italy at the shores of jerusalem and remember to the memory of jerusalem that they were allowed to go home .
all these are being respected .
the <unk> cylinder is created by the priests of the great <unk> of <unk> , marduk .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of living jews come to tehran .
some of you know more about their lives , but they &apos;re still thinking that they &apos;re <unk> .
the newly <unk> babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not touched , and at some point they learned , they were <unk> , and within less days they were <unk> , and they &apos;re starting to the air , like everyone else .
one study shows that <unk> 10 percent of a <unk> cost , whereas <unk> about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost my entire life in front of a camera .
you know quite quickly what you &apos;re doing to do to find an answer .
there were <unk> people there -- most of them are friends and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many meetings i was excited that this guy , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it was able to bring home to the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones that believed in peace and on his possibility , etc . , etc . -- and they made it a reality .
we connect with <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> , and i said , &quot; in london 2012 , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s about her <unk> to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should be beneficial .
i &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> of the origin of this number , but i never could .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , this is exactly what our ancestors probably had invented a million million years ago when they discovered cooking .
quite simple approaches for the <unk> conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m standing at the beginning .
but once the fights that fights itself , the physical rehabilitation was exposed .
behind him was a child , his son , his son , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and at night , i was talking to my boss in the headquarters , and i told them -- i &apos;m sorry -- i said -- i said , &quot; look , we start with a few hours a day . &quot;
two teams of the <unk> started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; yet , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but also in the streets of people .
and you should see me as a <unk> .
and this hospital could be able to afford <unk> .
why ? because the way that i had , was banned .
but i learned something more striking than that , because the manager -- the manager of the economy -- the manager of the economics -- absolutely bad decisions that were introduced to the economy of the collapse .
because i knew that the state of african continent for my children and their children would be important .
i &apos;m trying to see the experience i had to get in swarthmore .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment where a great society can rise within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s a yellow yellow ball of yellow ball very similar -- the sun that we draw as a children .
in fact , this is something that half of you , more than half , not be familiar .
32 pills <unk> <unk> .
<unk> probably . &quot;
and these are the messages they convey to you ?
because , in effect , the sponsors , the sponsors of love , and so he puts them on tv .
a professional <unk> that speaks to dead , she doesn &apos;t get me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to take suggestions of people like <unk> , <unk> and community communities , so they &apos;re doing something .
thank you .
that &apos;s why the entire hospital is often about a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but as the user can control whether it &apos;s just stream or not , because they can steer the <unk> on the ground , how much percentage of oxygen you are .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can put in hospitals .
the various ways of writing in africa , the first was <unk> , like the writing <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society in <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , as a filmmaker , john <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , which were <unk> in 1800 , centuries centuries ago .
almost a fifth of the greenhouse gasses from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and i like to make animals that are growing up and producing animals like tools , not just fine .
<unk> was a <unk> .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t very bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would mean that this may not be too bad .
i asked a question about a year , &quot; why am i , although i know , i know , what i know is no ? &quot;
on the weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and all the names , even though it &apos;s even mistake .
it &apos;s got distracted . it &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would mean , you know , it &apos;s an interest in to find more than the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very depressing area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a big artwork .
human nature had to change .
but part of the reason -- and this is the reason why we have a ethical level in the pursuit of -- is that they &apos;re intrinsic valuable .
it could be more complicated , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i just knew that i need some remote control .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that you can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , <unk> the individual slices as the <unk> in the hallway and <unk> us .
i was sure 20 , before i first went into an art museum .
i thought , okay , i thought , well , you have some criteria like you want your work .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they were interested in creating a novel , alternative <unk> , and they needed cash for it , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising .
this project is called <unk> .
and so we went to the grave and did this , it was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
and she describes like the <unk> -- everything you say is like the <unk> of <unk> .
he &apos;s a <unk> psychoanalyst of congress , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s related to origami . so .
people used to be mathematical principles on the arts to understand the underlying principles .
or they &apos;re putting it on the top , and they &apos;re making 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules out of these things that you put circles in the lines of the lines , the extra laws of influence . that makes the crease pattern .
you can make lots of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need something origami .
and it doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re in space or whether you &apos;re going into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington with a lot more time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about <unk> for hours .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this is going to be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 in 1973 in 1973 , just before the women start working on the market , and it goes on to the day day .
there was instructions .
because i &apos;m writing about all this book , i still <unk> myself , and i have no answer .
and that was very disheartening .
since we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , they come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and some sort of <unk> way , where you can see stereotypes .
there is no man or not a woman who is in the middle and the wires .
but the personal income on a scale that is held constant to account for inflation , in that time , more than doubles , has nearly <unk> .
and to listen to me and understand what i say , you know about 60 bits per second .
and just continue to happen , so in the last book of mine called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed a bunch of ceos that have been very successful and very successful at the same time and at the same time with a social sense .
control is always a safe thing , because you think you &apos;re probably feeling very much , but not very much aroused .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own sense of what home is , they had their sense of community , and even for hostility , they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go out of the time . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are in the future or more of the present , as the past .
i went down in the room where i was supposed to sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the developed world and two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why i &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , digital technology .
the children &apos;s survival is the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; your british and your mortality rate is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with <unk> , made them grow , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice -- mice that could not produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
if you could be very good at the equator as well as well .
certainly a lot of progress , many <unk> lives .
this is actually actual photograph , in time lapse , showing that the limb is <unk> within less days .
and here you see what &apos;s six months later , which is technically <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> is made of two different types of types .
so we put it back into this oven-like device .
there &apos;s more complex organs , and yet the most complex solid organs are the high <unk> , with lots of <unk> <unk> organs , liver liver , liver , liver and kidney .
this is still in <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not going to reject and not make tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem there would have an idea .
so i &apos;m actually a little bit of panic -- unlike all of the <unk> and sugar , which i had -- but this is an entrepreneur for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to a <unk> .
i went to door door and sells <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
it &apos;s pointless . &quot; you need to find a way to get faster on money .
i sold a lot of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get their regular income , but they have the ability to find other tasks , and they &apos;re learning , the ability of <unk> , and they also learn the ability to find other ways .
if you go into a restaurant and bad use , you &apos;ll show you what bad looks like .
these boys , <unk> .
the development of the students today is all the interests except for one of the board .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> deprive the majority of our students .
the values of the past are also <unk> . this is a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should deal with , if we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s going on is you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t happen to another result , it has the potential to transform how we interact with each other .
completely different .
in fact , this is not a proper organization , but clear -- let me finish this -- creative commons offers a simple way to get their content to the freedoms that they want to leave you with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often happens a little bit .
he told me that he <unk> the <unk> and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next space , and we &apos;re going to <unk> right now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i run through this process and show you how this journey looks .
and the hospital and general <unk> were very happy .
i survived , just so we &apos;re right .
i &apos;m always asking by people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to use our advantage ? &quot;
another way of how microbes can spread through human beings . architects like <unk> spaces like <unk> , and to encourage the human interaction , and the exchange of ideas in terms of labs .
so imagine a design that looks microbes , for example , or on the airplane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted the <unk> . and a way to do that , with one way that you wanted to achieve this , was one of these whales whales .
at 78 percent of the voices . and to give you an idea of the <unk> defeat , we &apos;ve only got three percent of the three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is : you can be very successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege it is to stand today .
this is the school that was built by the community .
something we have in gando are <unk> .
simple .

there is the color red and the color black , you &apos;re standing black , and they &apos;re the <unk> shift from day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good slate .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not as a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t have a country like china , a civilization-state , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason for that is , first , the state in china gets a very special one -- is very much , very special as the <unk> , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was in &apos; 72 miles of beijing to shanghai and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen that in terms of the <unk> -- which is the position of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or the <unk> .

most places i went to go , i decided i heard about them in the media .
i took more pictures and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you in the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were fired , <unk> woman , &quot; now can god see me . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each photo .
but they took me off a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the mesh and what you &apos;re driving about why it &apos;s going to happen now , i think there &apos;s some factors that i want to give you as a <unk> .

it &apos;s going to demand for participation . cities have said , &quot; cities have been <unk> .
it &apos;s very affordable , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years were extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
this would involve a significant <unk> .
it &apos;s vital that the ted ideas of ted ideas , ideas , ideas that we &apos;re thinking about , and make sure that this is a particularly successful century , and not one of <unk> and <unk> .
my remaining family are boring , <unk> , who are concerned with <unk> <unk> for our <unk> .

this time , i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very privileged to be here at ted 2006 between all of us in 2006 , and in fact they &apos;re very excited .

i think you agree with me that they look very well .
and we &apos;ve done tests with over 50,000 students , so about , like , a half a dozen schools built , my readers , by the way , by the way .

and ultimately , the only person that &apos;s going to step forward is a young shepherd , and he goes to me and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , guys on horses and with <unk> .
goliath is a slight prey . he has no opportunity .
so goliath is a greater than a <unk> period of time , and usually there &apos;s an explanation of that if someone is so far beyond the norm .
and i think that there is a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out that we are covered by a <unk> , and these microbes are usually good than killing us .
they have all the microbes in the <unk> , and they used to be used in the recipient .
most of the pills , or the <unk> <unk> that you can eat , or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands and thousands of species .
we need a solar system for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what to do our lives .
so a lot of people think about the internet is very focused on english , but for us it &apos;s truly global . we have a lot of languages .
when you saw him a ridiculous change on the side of me , they probably thought that it was going to be <unk> in <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we &apos;re not talking a lot about truth and objectivity .

so in some iteration , they have a tools , about sponges and <unk> .
so dolphins can <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
look at how they synchronize their partner and the other <unk> .
but what we did was , we quickly get out of the <unk> dolphins to hang on a keyboard on a keyboard .

it was upward upward and continuing on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws from my body . &quot;
and we have the sign of <unk> to the right , <unk> &apos;s god -- and they both work together .
and so the answer , i think , is to use this passionate commitment to the truth and try to turn them into a better future .
but if you react , a lot of other people in the environment that are innocent , but also they might be hurt -- the military don &apos;t want to talk about <unk> .
we &apos;re looking at something else , &quot; and we realized that the situations were actually very comparable .

in the night before my surgery , i looked at them and asked me , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;

so there we go .
what you see here is the blue spaces are approximately degrees fahrenheit than the red spaces .
it works over smaller distances than gravity works , what explains why they &apos;re smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re going to be familiar with the patient &apos;s brain .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you wonder , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it &apos;s about insurance companies .
and then they have to decide how they invest in their 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard about a <unk> .
at least a wonderful trial has predicted this .

this is just an example .
it &apos;s a song about an so-called <unk> , a creature which is a character , which is a character .

thank you .
that knowledge has too much influence on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we make stories to explain our existence .

if on a limited planet of planet all &#91; products &#93; , how can we achieve this ?
coke needs to work with diet .
these are nine of them .
at the end , we had 60 percent of the world &apos;s production of the world , and 25 percent of the world &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they buy the carbon in the trees around the trees in the trees , the <unk> of the <unk> of the product to europe .
so the communication between the brain and the spinal cord is interrupted ; that leads to a complete and sustained paralysis of the <unk> .
after a few years , it &apos;s managed to develop a electrochemical <unk> , which is <unk> the nervous system of the spinal cord .
we &apos;ve been working 10 years of doing this goal .
after a few weeks , we put a programmable pump to the spinal cord to inject a individual <unk> directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid who was a kid .
he was talking about the world , as she is , &quot; the world should be &quot; and the world .
and by doing that , <unk> , these women are many obstacles out of the way .
in the white house , and the desk he sits on is called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the last day , the woman who had been taking care of all of the time , and we spoke to each other , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing something ? &quot;
for this <unk> , a <unk> on the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneously , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t do anything .
so the internet needs <unk> and instructions .
one of the most popular websites in the world , the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing to do what youtube or google could have had to do .

this is a blog that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
why ? it &apos;s a <unk> .
the world ended up in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the sphere is very , very much , very powerful .
all this costs money .
and it was a lot about to students to students with <unk> or social weak families for the same opportunities .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in bureaucratic <unk> , teachers are going to hold teachers in the classroom and keep themselves in many ways .
some people say that the change of the <unk> looks like a <unk> .
but if you look at the problem of this perspective , you see what &apos;s happened in the last 60 years .
and i walked around the entire morning about 15 miles to come to the <unk> .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could also do that with phones .
so there &apos;s a business for them .
&quot; government has to offer economically affordable services . &quot;
it was once long , a long time ago , when i was 24 years old , i studied at the st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my map here if i &apos;m here .
also , i &apos;m going to use an invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is going through a period of war with low lifespan .
and they decided to invest not only in health and education , but also , the economy is growing .
washington , d.c. went out outside .
not the bubble , not the bubbles , but the cash bubble .
are the rich countries that are really going to be a completely altered economy in the world , and the power transition from there , where it was in the last 50 to 100 years back to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called &quot; dark energy . &quot;
but this explains the presence of the whole mass .
and i &apos;m not paying attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a sort of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on during the <unk> .
they &apos;re moving away from each other because the space gets bigger .
by looking at things like galaxies -- their <unk> , how many of them are as function as a function of time -- can we bring in experience of dark matter and dark energy to connect structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy banjo banjo boys : <unk> <unk> : new jersey ?
so recycling , recycling are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : 1.3 million reasons reinventing <unk>
and in fact , there was these change in gay men during the u.s.
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also a lot of children .
in uganda we see the spread of prevalence .
it &apos;s going to end with pretty similar <unk> .
but openness and connection has a prize when we think about diseases . it shouldn &apos;t be a surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> studies once the african statistics in africa from an economic perspective and comes to a surprising conclusion : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is incorrect .
but i was fascinated by because i saw this kind of <unk> italian <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; because it was the front <unk> , but every time he was driving into a tunnel , he built a <unk> on it .
this hump look at the water like a magnet .
and then we ask ourselves , why is the membrane of congested and why it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> in a material .
in <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , we work with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine : biomimicry is what biomimicry .
&quot; yeah , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and luckily , no boys .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india because it was once again and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a kind of evolution of captcha .
basically , you know , by making it starts with an old book .
the number of pages that use recaptcha is actually so high that the number of words that we &apos;re doing a day is very , very large .
some are more fun .
time is the web in several languages .
then my favorite question is the question .
there &apos;s a way to fly two . two flight flies .
but what &apos;s more surprising is that we get the translation of the <unk> , even if they &apos;re just a little bit of what we &apos;re going to get in , like the professional <unk> , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people are learning value , they don &apos;t have to pay for money , they pay for their time .

10 percent of the time <unk> the thought ... ...
i played the violent africans , the african terrorists .
well , the first <unk> didn &apos;t go out of the first <unk> -- it didn &apos;t have the absolute majority of the absolute majority -- so the election was continuing in a second round three weeks .
so here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i went to la <unk> , and i learned how to browse .
the people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how to make this stuff a bunch of different molecules , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to breathe that there &apos;s a certain reason for a certain reason and so .
and so , charles , he said , &quot; charles , i will give you a building , and you can meet you there , but don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everyone was going to do a little bit of mind .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i still have something that is not personal .
if you want to be rich , entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs .
they &apos;re saying , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s going to increase -- they &apos;re not going up at all , and we &apos;re measuring this for 20 years from satellite , and they &apos;re not going to increase .
biochemist kary mullis : the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and from his own <unk> in the garden and <unk> the curiosity , inspiration , inspiration in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a simple way of a living body that <unk> these <unk> , decrepit spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a relief for new york and &quot; <unk> , &quot; the <unk> and <unk> that comes from the feeling of <unk> in a urban environment .
i love to travel , and berlin is one of my favorites .
and the whole time i haven &apos;t seen a single rat in some of these places , until recently i was walking into the city of the city .
the first question is , and you may write them either , either on a paper , physically , or a virtual leaf in your head , and , for the audience home , you can try and try it out .
and we stop , &quot; we &apos;re the best <unk> college in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you know -- you &apos;re going -- well , in your <unk> , you &apos;ve got , &quot; hmm , what &apos;s happened during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult issues is , if people have a sense of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty hard to change those things .
and as an expert in inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues , the different from the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , he <unk> , <unk> , grows in a way .
we have an amazing life that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself introduced into a letter to an colleagues that was probably going to work somewhere in a warm pond , maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what &apos;s life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can combine them and we can literally create thousands and thousands of <unk> molecules to create large amounts of <unk> molecules and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in vision .
we want to put them in the environment , and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can manufacture inorganic biology and matter matter to matter , it &apos;s going to be defining life .
but there &apos;s another second reason why i love these <unk> : every single one .
and these are highly professional female interviewer who are sitting for an hour , and she asked them to ask her question .
i was sitting on friday in front of my computer , and i could see the mortality rate at that morning , and i was going to see the mortality rate of this morning .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of them .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make any sense of an average , which is not a <unk> , and this very rapid advance .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
they were high , or very high , child mortality and their families were very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s a <unk> .
whatever is more value for money .
yes , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he said to them , &quot; put the <unk> in question .
all the time was a border .
and <unk> , after my opinion , the world will make a difference , not just a few , not just for a few , but everyone .
... above the knee , it would be hard ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to meet everybody needs , but not everybody &apos;s going to everybody needs .
and <unk> are dying .
i went to high school .
when i was on the council of scientific research research research -- 40 laboratories -- when two <unk> were not born with each other languages , i built teams .
they &apos;ve got it up , and now i put apps in the app app store .
it &apos;s about something old to perfect and something old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but no more <unk> .
because this reactor &apos;s not under high pressure and chemically <unk> is not so reactive , meaning that the <unk> don &apos;t tend to rely on the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor that i &apos;ve designed here is an innovative power of <unk> , the marvelous scientific projects , and i &apos;m really willing to do this .
we &apos;re moving towards a <unk> where the experience is the actual product .
there is a manufacturer that &apos;s <unk> <unk> in the case that they run in the forest .
at the end of a long <unk> of good advice he gives his son <unk> , he says this : &quot; particularly , is <unk> against yourself .
usually you go much in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can run a lot , out in this city .
then they &apos;re going to be <unk> as a fake , using <unk> properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was little , i was very introverted and stayed for me alone .
and then it was just about to start at a point and then start to build them up .
so i built it out of concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : arms and hands develop 36 days : the primitive spine begins to make these weeks , these weeks , are the <unk> of the fetus .
the complexity , which is in a single system , again , beyond any understanding , or any existing math today .
because apparently , this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere of stars .
so what can you do with the spectra ?
recently , i sent a colleague of berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you look at this time ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- in which matter and chemical elements in the universe made and regenerate .
because can you imagine anything <unk> ?
now , imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t tell , and we &apos;re just saying , &quot; so we don &apos;t work . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see <unk> , and oxygen , i think , you know , we have the perfect legacy .
i just like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you is is universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m very addicted to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a little <unk> -- -- which was really rather like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what &apos;s going to be vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t right . shut up . shut .
we pretend that what we do , no effects on other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , you can make systematic improvements , then we think about how to be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do was we wanted to find a new access to health .
steven is now sharing his story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this cochlear implant , also these were the only <unk> that are online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you don &apos;t have data ; it &apos;s not going to work .
this is the curve &apos;s curve .
but my brother wasn &apos;t going to end with him .
if we went from <unk> to the <unk> , we &apos;d run something like this , 300 feet wide , 120 miles wide , and it &apos;s two gigatons .
to change the state , you just need two volts a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can make this better .
but there &apos;s a very intriguing solution that &apos;s called <unk> .
these are the networks of networks of complex systems .
and it also has implications for systemic risk .
so we could put a <unk> <unk> .
we see the evolution of <unk> and <unk> programs that focus on our connected world of view of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these <unk> .
no human <unk> .
so we were on top of our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t mean something that &apos;s invented .
and my brain starts to think very quickly , that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> to be positive in the world .
because this question assumes that our external world can predict our <unk> world , but the truth is that i only can predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s eye , if i can predict their entire external world .
and this is from two reasons scientific <unk> and <unk> .
we &apos;re going to move people , if they open up their <unk> , a positive email or to write somebody in their social environment .
hard to say -- a <unk> -- they understand -- my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and so i went . i went off , closed .
they said , make it stop .
you take a giant disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital <unk> in tokyo .
listen ? how cows ? this is the morning 4 a.m.
so there &apos;s all kinds of things , but most of the love i love to experience the world , taste .
and i ended up with passion .
their culture is not in school . and i want to illustrate ways how to overcome this problem .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and about little moments in my life .
or mothers who raised the young boy ?
we need to change attitudes to boys in the primary sciences .
and you have the idea that they believe that they &apos;re okay .
let &apos;s see where that hypothesis is .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give us &quot; why &quot; <unk> clues about the fundamental principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and give up , at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and this was really an important lesson for me that there &apos;s no object .
we have created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s a <unk> star with my ipad , and this is a software that runs on the ipad .
so it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i <unk> them to a <unk> , so that people will respond in the glass differently , when you go to them .
i &apos;m going to turn my <unk> in a middle-aged male , and then in an old man .
<unk> extra .
radio : what do you do ?
just fold the wings together , and you &apos;re going to go .
so i ask you another question .
and he made a <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , who had instruction , and night , but with the secret instruction , it &apos;s not particularly good to <unk> him .
because they &apos;ve figured out that <unk> human behavior is stronger .
and yet , we need to create a clear <unk> <unk> where you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s too much fair .
now , if we all have these tools , we just need to ask ourselves the question -- and <unk> and <unk> did this -- how we use these smart devices .
they take the new <unk> .
they give little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt passion , soul and heart , had my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , <unk> <unk> is a different replicator in this culture of culture .
you probably bought them .
imagine the world of brains and more memes as a space for you all there .
we are the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hi .
and they &apos;re using us to produce the resource of the planet to produce more and more computing , and more amazing things we hear here at ted .
and are we going to see this third of danger , how we &apos;ve gone to the second and first ?
in conjunction with <unk> -- this is the <unk> prevalence in haiti -- with the ministry of public <unk> , which is the ministry of public <unk> , peru , <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to cost us if we do it right . &quot;
and because i was burning at 70 percent of my body , all around an hour .
and what we &apos;ve been found was that it would have been good , and then i would have breaks my breath to recover from the pain .
and how bad would the sentence , if i could get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t so that the <unk> people -- the more commandments -- less <unk> would have <unk> , and that &apos;s the less religious -- those who could not remember <unk> -- more <unk> .
so if you don &apos;t think about money for a few seconds , because you &apos;re getting a brand , it makes a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all these forces have very bad implications for the stock market .
but they can believe me . i work in advertising .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and all of a sudden , amazon will become the brand and <unk> with the <unk> , defined as you want to spend your money , what money is , and what it is .
maybe that &apos;s a big leap ?
i don &apos;t have to explain the audience i didn &apos;t want to explain -- last week , i had to explain it -- these are the structures that beat sperm from one individual individual to another .
and i know that animals like the <unk> here , or even most of the animals , they don &apos;t stabilize their tissues , by putting them on bones .
and that was that every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found out to <unk> in nature across the same time that had the same lightbulb .
all i showed that was really surprised .
a funny song about the global warming , by the jill sobule .
well , i guess i need to .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> totally out of this , and ben became a <unk> .
go ahead , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave , my home , the democratic republic of the congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> , the <unk> of the united nations , the wealth of the country &apos;s assets on over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the target .
they have to be very inexpensive .
but could not be done for this angle to do more ?
they demanded from the governments of governments , and in many cases , they have them .
but let &apos;s take a time , our goal is to bring new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of transactions to make their revenues .
he liked to sit in her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since <unk> , as sir , sir <unk> <unk> and the british society decided that the sun seems to be .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something <unk> .
and this energy is <unk> the fusion .
something like a conventional <unk> .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the biggest arab country and it &apos;s also a big impact .
now , they wanted to think about democracy , but they were the population of all countries that had the population in the last month in the last month of their opinion -- it was only four percent .
but the expectation of the people that are really important for their future .
so the question is , &quot; what drives the male support for women ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the news .
nobody can listen to them , sending them just to text .
you could see the immediate effects of the law or the <unk> speech on a <unk> , and see what happens as a consequence .
flight flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 .
this is <unk> for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
the smallest <unk> of the <unk> forces of nature .
we can afford as individuals , and we can listen to ourselves .
we believe somebody else , somebody <unk> , somebody <unk> , someone with more means solving this problem .
we flew it into the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s a tremendous amount of <unk> that is possible , and this is what it is , and this is serious serious what it means .
and let &apos;s think about our moral imagination .
and the director was quite brave and told me that he thought he was mad . and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are <unk> .
it needed several such events until i figured out what i should do .
when i started this program four years ago with this program , my <unk> plan was a <unk> of <unk> .
and they look down to <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and i feel happy i had 15 years ago , my courage to spend my lectures in nyu and back in my country , where i <unk> these incredible rides with this group of <unk> children .
and how frequently would my dying die , before i could understand that it doesn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly enough , <unk> these findings are not my <unk> sense , that feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t even know what was in between .
imagine what kind of species we could have , if we honor the ancient death of the self , the privilege of knowing the life of life and what &apos;s excited about what is next .
and this is a <unk> of the sea in britain .
but instead of what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re focused on the pan .
we also discovered that as a <unk> structure , and we would get a <unk> way through this structure .
but we realized that seeds -- this really important project -- but that seed -- but that seeds -- into the leading botanical gardens are released .
and we teamed up with a <unk> to develop a torch of the seed cathedral , even if you &apos;re visually visually , it was kind of <unk> and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few cups you think , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called the title of &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea because the human mind is a blank slate , and all the structure of its socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a lot of a political reasons that they love the people .
and by the way , it &apos;s still not clear , if that &apos;s what it is automatically sucks , but it seemed to be the <unk> .
another one is the <unk> and <unk> of the universities that are in <unk> in the demise .
well , the other hot iron iron is the <unk> .
and i think you can &apos;t tell that better .
i &apos;m also calling a <unk> , just so from <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but they &apos;re saying it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking about . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s weird .
so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> challenges .
right ?
it &apos;s the way -- we &apos;ve heard the work of the war as a society , each of us .
her iphone with no people , the same skin , the same circuits that make the same keyboard , and over again .
and then it was going to be thicker and <unk> , and now it &apos;s <unk> pages .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you have a fake fake ? &quot;
but how is you in a sane way ?
so , all of the things that happened to tony on tony was evidence according to his clinician to be crazy .
he came in <unk> businesses and 30 percent of the workforce , american cities are just transformed into <unk> .
and i added up , &quot; i have a list of some sort of <unk> features in my pocket .
and the molas are always the absolute aspects of the character of the interviewee .
however , it was like two years ago , and this is where my book ended up .
in fact , that &apos;s the trend of the rest of the world .
and as a consequence of that , it &apos;s very , very hard to say , very hard to say , i &apos;m <unk> the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a great war between east and west <unk> , and that the fundamental democracy was required for communism .
and even though the president , for <unk> reasons , was very , very well , with islam &apos;s not the enemy , there &apos;s nevertheless , it &apos;s nonetheless , a natural impulse on the enemy to call the other side .
as the standard of 2000 , you saw the peak of the best <unk> , which was the peak of african penguins , which had ever been launched -- at that time , the researchers have been <unk> .
and a day after our arrival , two of us have been <unk> about the <unk> of the two , more than 4,000 oiled penguins .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue .
and this is really important because of the african penguin being explained by a endangered kind of art .
at the <unk> row in <unk> row , the <unk> , a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police station .
people are open for the <unk> .
so we launched this campaign -- very quickly , called &quot; every egg . &quot;
this is not a <unk> of the second grade .
these conversations appear to be abstract .
hillel turned on a leg , and he said , &quot; what &apos;s your neighbors are not to do your neighbors . that &apos;s the <unk> . the rest are commentary .
now -- this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes <unk> and puts him carefully at whose father , and the two men look at each other and see each other than divine .
this is actually looking at the cells of the cells in biology and science , looking at living cells cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this picture was the beginning of the <unk> .
we all look inside the inside , believe me .
the walls are made of 700 inches thick , solid concrete .
and the one on the left is an x-ray .
it &apos;s the human association .
in x-ray , we see all the little <unk> in the corners .
i had to <unk> the car in the middle , which is not a really simple task .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys for a week , and after this week , they have used to use them as a toilet .
in fact , science says we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i applaud a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
how do we know it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we don &apos;t agree with us .
not professor and <unk> , just two ghosts , ready to <unk> .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacture was that there were right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
then would be time to process the information ?
so we spent a lot of time , one billion dollars in a billion , and they hear right now -- a billion <unk> <unk> <unk> that he was involved , and what we found was shocking , but more later .
there &apos;s dan etete .
so we were amazed that these companies were rapidly <unk> their <unk> , and the key to london <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all the old . we &apos;re going to get sick . people left us .
there are places where you cannot go , don &apos;t mind , worlds that you can &apos;t be able to inhabit worlds .
they have a <unk> and an freedom of that i think they &apos;re the foundation of a new <unk> .
she made the decision to get no <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but their lives to do that no other thing was happening .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you <unk> this thing about the head , and then it happens .
but this isn &apos;t . &quot;
i miss michael .
and he didn &apos;t find it , his staff <unk> him , and they said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the recovery , or you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
ah ! we meet it , the <unk> beloved beloved . let &apos;s pull out .
if it &apos;s in the box , which is the <unk> , then it makes it .
the characteristics of what are the word <unk> are so often to see that we should eradicate this age of the age of <unk> , if it comes to criticize behavior , which is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
if i <unk> the capacity of my sister , the 10 percent of interest in the last <unk> , i will have <unk> her ability to get their ability to get more money from me to get it back .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re not living in the dark times .
and the third of these are all noises that we &apos;re creating people , the <unk> .
this is after selective logging .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> of marriage , among other things , the way animals taught us to dance and sing them for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder , how much this is , this <unk> here is 16 .
so , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very nice concert .
and these are the issues that are actually at heart .
one generation that &apos;s so much more meaning from video games , than the real world .
all these are problems outside my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games is for our civilization .
end ! finally ! that was .
it wouldn &apos;t be good .
so , you get quickly from the simple complex to complex , if you do more . we like .
and then they look at them , and that &apos;s the pain -- i thought , at least for a long time , until she &apos;s explained to me , that &apos;s what you think about it , so they &apos;re thinking .
it &apos;s going to go to the other direction .
girl : there was a bullet and a <unk> , because it &apos;s two very different modes of <unk> , and if you drop them at the same time , you might fall , drop them <unk> .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
ultimately , we &apos;re going to change ourselves as we change the world around us .
that &apos;s an incredible impact .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they affect us too much .
they &apos;re going to work over time .
i &apos;m going to echo his words back right .
&quot; well , &quot; yes , &quot; i said , &quot; strange , that you ask the question .
it &apos;s like , &quot; you don &apos;t need it again . &quot;
we looked at that , and i was grateful because she &apos;s just said , &quot; whoa ! this is insane . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a <unk> team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is some serious problems with the project causing problems that shouldn &apos;t have .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change , not quite a <unk> engineer that has already served .
you can actually find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and it &apos;s very fast and easy .
yeah , well , you know , her life comes up with me , because <unk> was about beautiful <unk> shape .
no , but it &apos;s true , the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i asked them to draw , nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth , &quot; i brought to a lot about the audience with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they have been here , until we &apos;ve been here , until we reach the second microbial age .
its impact is the distribution of this very thin <unk> on the planet , and we had a very <unk> death death of dinosaurs that &apos;s death of these beautiful <unk> <unk> , <unk> here , and so much else .
it &apos;s the ultimate <unk> , the <unk> of his time .
they hate animals .
this is when material comes from the depths of the earth and the surface , spread above the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> off the coast , what will happen to me ?
they have an accident . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of them are countries who think that deregulation or no regulation of the best way is to make investment , pay for investment .
the answer is simple : the chinese will define these factories as chemical businesses , not as <unk> , and checking them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to be able to bring them together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
but now we have the idea that it &apos;s about a new way of regulation in the beginning of international tasks .
human rights are going to be a very simple question : can i get that people going back ?
or to find the young boy who put the fire in the beginning to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was <unk> and <unk> .
again , again , we saw how the word poetry poetry <unk> .
after the fight , he stopped his <unk> , <unk> hair and said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students are reaching their third step , but i was lucky enough to see that their journey was so evolved as she did .
my parents have been called me , which is a <unk> name .
i want to talk about some ideas that propelled me to become a <unk> .
when i saw that the war for anyone who had such incredibly profound consequences , and that the <unk> could actually be a factor in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a <unk> .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released in prison , the black population was the last phase of the liberation of apartheid .
the next day , i made myself in rwanda , and it was like i went to the hell of the hell .
after the fall of <unk> in indonesia in indonesia , i began to explore the conditions of poverty in a country that was in the way to fight .
a hospital of &quot; doctors without borders &quot; in a refugee camp .
the <unk> is so efficient that the percentage of the soldiers who survive a <unk> is much higher than everyone else in our history .
to make sure that &apos;s as little as possible as possible can be able to be able to do all these procedures .
so you select this .
but this is a broad , and pretty hard topic , so i had to cut myself .
the size of the population -- here &apos;s big china , here &apos;s india .
and all the eastern religions except japan was the same time .
because death is a child &apos;s death with another child .
what &apos;s the reason in qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all the religions in the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , like everyone else in our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
day eight .
in india alone , my best friends were best friends and i went to doors to the door with this same picture , every house in india . we made a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all <unk> -- and i asked them those questions that they want to ask them .
i think we owe to the gphin , and ron st. john &apos;s very much gratitude , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- over there -- he &apos;s the founders of gphin .
larry brilliant : the first thing , are you not angry because of the injury ?
have a <unk> set , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , to the world , as a business ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with an led that they would double with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent are quite hard to be hard , and we had this conversation in business .
a <unk> paid for yourself at seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 <unk> , today , today &apos;s 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to end this gap , and that way to follow their way to high management consequences .
there was an equation in my family , like this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
someone who thinks it frightens , or what &apos;s going to take a steam out of your ears .
at the end of our <unk> , we realized the openness of the others .
as i would always get back to bangalore , and often a vibrant discussions of my friends at home , where we discussed various subjects , while she complained <unk> about new <unk> , where a drink more of a drink than what they &apos;ve paid for .
he searches for forgiveness , and he claims that he wants to improve the lives of his child soldiers .
this <unk> seemed to be pretty happy , and there had no deaths from having been killed in liberia , despite having been killed dozens of <unk> .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s troubling -- not ? -- that the media in the world are making a bad job , that a small group of activists in the situation is more than more information than the rest of the <unk> combined .
j yeah . this was the front page in the guardian , and it was in all the countries around kenya , in the <unk> and south african press .
j the impact on the people who worked on it was considerably considerably .
and there are lots of information .
i would be interested in , just because what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious about the ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be <unk> by the word hacker .
and just a month ago , this was all the <unk> parliament called <unk> <unk> .
and all of these numbers , i start with just two or three variables .
this piece here can be very different , depending on where you &apos;re <unk> .
first of all , i read about a <unk> in a <unk> . that between the <unk> of the <unk> medicine and seven <unk> .
so , according to these studies , the best <unk> for a chicken wouldn &apos;t be in short , but certainly not too long , until it gets black , and it &apos;s a <unk> bag of bags or <unk> sugars .
and then in the next summer , i worked under the line of dr. <unk> at <unk> , texas , texas .
and this realization is incredible for the efficiency of chemotherapy , maybe for many different types of cancer .
for example , volatile organic pollutants are emitting chemical pollutants that are in our schools , right and the work .
because all these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re durable , and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the following generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people come to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthesis is no more for the need , a lack of fishing .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .
i was as a beijing race for the olympic play .
roughly 80 percent of these <unk> are young people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of banks , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> from europe and america &apos;s products that produce them .
they have a kind of devices that you can draw on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like cattle .
people are thinking about this question : will we get our environment on behalf of a higher of gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there to eat , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
well , the series was not even <unk> , so they &apos;re the first ones to see this .
mars is more similar than the earth , it seems to be equally <unk> .
sousa was terrified that we have the opportunity to lose , quote , &quot; <unk> . &quot; they would take us .
but a lot more important was that bmi used to be used to generate the new <unk> of creating new <unk> that they were for free to their clients , and then in 1940 in 1940 in 1940 , as a <unk> of court .
and i ...
for the <unk> , for the <unk> , i &apos;m trying to ask as a good liberal , of course , first of the government , a mistake , right ?
this is really <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
okay , i don &apos;t want to alert to you here , but i just noticed that the person right next to you is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat , no . &quot;
another trial showed that strangers are three times within the first 10 minutes to lie .
here &apos;s what happened with her kittens .
i &apos;ll say it again .
don &apos;t look at a moment in the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake the head .
and the science has a lot more sophisticated in the daylight .
look carefully , and you &apos;ll see you &apos;re going to smile in the whole video .
so in this way , in this way , the world can be good for us to be meaningful , a little bit more complicated to our moral regime .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world where we live , but that &apos;s not true .
so what here is as a <unk> , if not even tragic joke , <unk> as ethnic <unk> .
six months after six months , without any one explanation for me .
that &apos;s what interests me .
when i was 10 , i read james <unk> &apos;s country , &quot; and i was broken .
a new song i did .
so i took a time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how are you incentive based on the effects that they act on these remote villages ?
<unk> me not as appealing as &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re going to be cut .
much more people have been bitten .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things , first of what we &apos;ve lost , and second , how we gain it .
here you can see the largest part of the living creatures of the <unk> <unk> .
if you don &apos;t have a coral reef , because it &apos;s <unk> &apos;s protected , or <unk> , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , they come back to the fish , eating the sea , and then the algae grow back .
you can see the boundary of the <unk> , because there are the boats of all the <unk> .
if it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so the protection of the coral is the <unk> and seas of money by governments and <unk> institutions , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in coral reefs we &apos;ve figured out that the pyramid of the pyramid is the equivalent of the <unk> to a <unk> .
okay , <unk> , i thank you for a part of your spiritual experience . thank you . thank you .
it &apos;s the longest nature in the sea .
they come up to the submarine -- they come up with the eyes of the windows and take place in the submersible .
among other things we &apos;re trying to do with our partners , this virtual world -- this world , this area , this expanse of area -- to bring into the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have <unk> . they don &apos;t have mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen before is from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in <unk> .
these worms grow several inches in the week .
the concept of <unk> is futile .
and the remaining one percent is <unk> after the formula that can apply to the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s made by <unk> , measurements , <unk> , dots , etc .
the students have to do this . they need to formulate them .
and the best one , or one of the best parts , is that we can &apos;t get the answer to the end of the <unk> .
so what &apos;s happened with the small hadron collider ?
here &apos;s the fastest growing young population of the world .
it &apos;s <unk> . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that &apos;s been placed at the <unk> of the slum in a <unk> socially <unk> entrepreneur named sugata <unk> .
well , the key is motivation , and it &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a building construction in pune , which is the fastest growing city of asia .
you should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal framework , schools , <unk> , hospitals , in which innovation can occur , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child &apos;s child at age 15 , which wants to have a place in a school , will be able to get one .
and while i look at him , this scene , which i &apos;m going to arrive at tears , and i &apos;ve been <unk> for 25 years .
so here are a couple of parents of teenagers who have to cook , and all the time we have to cook -- and they <unk> every night for two , three or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he goes around all the time and consume everything .
these gay , people like me , want to be treated as a full citizen , and it &apos;s just written directly in front of our nose .
because people have to worry about their job , so they don &apos;t show who they &apos;re really , at home , and it &apos;s not just north carolina ; in all states , there is no shading that there is legal .
think about it .
and i was scared .
about three years ago i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it &apos;s helping us to become what we could be .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and in fact , there is this insect .
i showed you earlier one of somebody .
it &apos;s not just 43 to 44 degrees fahrenheit to 44 degrees fahrenheit for about two days , but it &apos;s a constant temperature .
but the contrast is going to be like this . they &apos;re going to sleep in the background .
here , the american americans , and yes , it was -- it was -- actually -- a game .
she started to tell me about it , and all the parents here will recognize the <unk> .
i have a <unk> history .
our lives is defined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create fantastic interfaces that can tell us to share fantastic .
i have a look at the various <unk> of <unk> , because you can select what you want to highlight .
it &apos;s a <unk> man who &apos;s sitting in the box and controls these <unk> .
a <unk> from about 11 pages an hour , which is a $ <unk> cents .
in the bottom , you can see -- what you see on the left is the <unk> , and on the right , you see the <unk> as he was interpreted by 16 people who had no idea what they do .
<unk> bell : <unk> , <unk> ... aaron <unk> : and we took all these individual pieces and put them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew that we needed to be the right person in the right , and we could build something that we could build .
and all of the individual <unk> people that submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made these lines of images , cut , and i put them together in <unk> .
so a <unk> implication is that you just see a part of its image , and that leads to a very free structure .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , just like the earthquake in haiti .
then i ran 50 miles , 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of layers that we &apos;re made , and what we &apos;re presenting to the world as our identity .
another <unk> is in a public library in san jose , california .
so each other . each other .
it &apos;s now easier than ever before to make a good living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
she &apos;s just too weird .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called the &quot; unhappy , &quot; literally , somebody who was lucky , the fate of the fortune , not <unk> .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s going to do at the last dish with angels and <unk> , and the sky will open up .
and i told them the action of <unk> <unk> .
what i think , i think , really , is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own <unk> .
alain de botton : a <unk> , <unk> <unk>
if you &apos;re training for this sport , don &apos;t smile .
you know , you tear it down with <unk> glasses , and you ascend 60 moves per minute , so you &apos;re never really <unk> .
they &apos;re in the liquid <unk> .
my breath is down to three <unk> the minute .
they should worry about me , i didn &apos;t make them .
i swam in this thing .
it &apos;s the only thing i &apos;m interested in .
this is already today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly <unk> <unk> , like many of these things are special <unk> , because they &apos;re not integrated .
many of you have the phillips direct life .
this is an important part of our lives . we &apos;re supposed to sleep a third of our lives .
ok . so let &apos;s go away from sleep .
so we can change the medicine in the <unk> , at all ages , from <unk> , or <unk> kids to the senior , and the <unk> arena is changing ; the entire spectrum of disease -- i hope i have a feeling of it -- around the globe .
so , i hope , i &apos;ve convinced you -- the implications for the <unk> are vast and the effects of diseases are also stunning in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular called space is generated , and he says , maybe not the best way , and destroying the whole system .
and so not there wouldn &apos;t exist .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
<unk> should be faster .
and you may wonder how to make these trade-offs .
our one is the only cookbook of the world , in the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robot is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more competent than doctors .
but eventually , the woke up too .
they had to give their intuitive <unk> to the instruments .
i told you about the big , complicated robots .
and as you can see how it comes out there to do something useful , it &apos;s not going to be so <unk> .
and we don &apos;t have to cut us down this <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was my fault .
we haven &apos;t just shown that bacteria could be the solution of plastic waste , but also , that &apos;s the openness to <unk> <unk> .
the film that we &apos;re going to see is that they &apos;re going to have the <unk> in new york city .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it continued . they always have always tried to make things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house . &quot;
i think in my family we had very much luck . because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
ah , very good !
ed : and then a row is a complete <unk> <unk> . because in the <unk> history of the paris in paris , in the beginning , the message has been in the beginning .
you can see this chair ? the orange one ? this is the <unk> <unk> .
because part of that is where we want to get to .
it was <unk> of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were <unk> . no robust information .
one of them is known : the population explosion . the population of the population is two to nearly seven billion people in the last 50 years .

this is a beautiful image of visual <unk> a mouse &apos;s lab from jeff <unk> , and you can see the wonderful pictures of brains that he showed in his talk .
they <unk> a <unk> to <unk> any behavior , another <unk> has got another <unk> and patterns and you can think that it works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to be a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinks tea .
if you look at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s made of a little different components . <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many a <unk> tree is there ? where are you ?

we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it activate , and see what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the mysteries of the brain will be solved , mental illness , memory , memory , makes it look for neurons and electrical signals , and he performs it with a supercomputer , the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started to build smaller models , and began this .
this is what nasa did was to get a <unk> machine that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there is so much , you can get people from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they usually think it has something to do with the culture .
the countries on the right , those who are the very much , they have a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but again , it &apos;s going to get more complex .
one online <unk> for the <unk> dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we don &apos;t really know what we don &apos;t know .
in fact , in medical expression , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared in infrared , you can only use the <unk> of the eyes .
their intensity can be very quickly , and it can become very quickly off .
they &apos;re critical .
but by the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> traffic lights with the cars and so on .
dna is what life is mean .
it &apos;s actually not that many data .
you have a <unk> genome , and the power of creating an interaction medicine is better than the present -- they have no side effects .
it &apos;s just just -- it &apos;s just <unk> genes -- but we were able to synthesize it completely .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms in the world around the world , but are part of a big ecosystem ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we poison or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us that &apos;s been made .
now , i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of digging in a moment when we have on one side of the people who think you &apos;re going to think you &apos;re a dog , first of all the rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; just beat . and therefore they &apos;re hit .
no , we make &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- bam , he can do it after six to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , it might not be .
not only with the puppy , but the rest of the family .
these <unk> are so simple .
their kids are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill is -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still remember working with energy .
because i used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to let them sound <unk> .
and even rarer , if it &apos;s accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white flash .
64 diagnosed with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert <unk> was a mile or two per year .
homo erectus made the same tool over 100,000 generations .
you can teach them in the lab to practice a little bit more <unk> , and there &apos;s also a <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of an object that never happens to another happens .
it &apos;s the wealth ; it &apos;s the wealth of your own needs to save time .
we &apos;ve reached that as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence .
and when people began to start creating objects like this , it was a clue that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a mouse ?
but that &apos;s me , i &apos;m also about the connections that people are going to be there , and that &apos;s never going to be there , and to mate , and i &apos;m sure that the technology is going to continue to continue to continue to continue the technology , and therefore they &apos;re going to improve the <unk> .
this is as high as a <unk> building . i &apos;m going to be the <unk> of the world .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just way , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , usually the rapid development problem , because how can we discover things that are constantly changing constantly ?
i talked about it -- you know , you know this situation if you &apos;re not diagnosed at the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we have a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , we &apos;re new , so we have rhinoviruses .
after 10 years old , they came back to a couple of other days -- still a fever -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in her lungs .
it was not very often sequenced .
it &apos;s a classic feat , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has ever seen before .
a huge battery could it .
instead , we &apos;re doing something that fits the <unk> of the <unk> .
i got a plank at low altitudes at low altitudes , a <unk> dense , and a molten salt between between and a little salt .
but david is young and clever , and he wants to build a <unk> , and he &apos;s building -- he &apos;s building the very first metal column with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of that ?
this video was taken in <unk> , 6 miles from the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 meters below the surface surface .
quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to <unk> myself for maria <unk> and her methods , and how important she felt , and how important they found it , and they &apos;re not taught to be taught in a open way .
evolution is often as a road that we chose , but it represents a great number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the phase of space space .
our cities are at risk because many of them are on shore .
there are also stars and so forth .
so if we think about <unk> behavior or body language , as the social scientists call , it &apos;s about language . we think about communication .
this expression , as a pride , has been studied by jessica tracy , and she pointed out for the people to blind people and from birth to blind people to blind people .
so i thought about it . you know , you can see these people , and you can get them involved , and you could get them to do it , and then you would get more involved ?
what happens in a <unk> , what happens if you &apos;re on the <unk> stage ? like the little little manipulation , these tiny <unk> ?
this is happening in the lab . the small exercise , for just a few minutes , where can you really apply that ? that was , of course .
these things . people would tell them their true . they &apos;re showing themselves .
she was completely depressed , and she said , &quot; i have nothing to look like . &quot;
they need your body , privacy and two minutes , and it can impact the other way in large ways .
<unk> swimming swimming to their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> an ant , <unk> her in the brain and driving them a blade of grass .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and important , that these ideas are not going to be abused .
and of course they &apos;re extinct in extinct now .
but under all these ideas that are going to spread our technology around the world , are many toxic ideas .
and like viruses , we &apos;re not going to try to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went up international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t is not in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody listened to each other . nobody is familiar .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to believe that this shouldn &apos;t happen , but that we need to be better , if it comes to the question that you need to consider the questions that you need to consider the consequences and the reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re the driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day , and he &apos;s making a <unk> <unk> , and i explained that they &apos;re not married to get married before these things are done .
finally , despair , they went and <unk> a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to talk the best talk you &apos;re going to regret .
okay , the big majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the interconnectedness of everything , and the unity of everything , and his basic value was respect to strangers , was kindness to strangers .
who struggle while he goes ?
they &apos;re starting to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more <unk> , and recently , they &apos;ve now got income to support their family .
just go to somebody else , with a different country , from a different country , with another <unk> , which is kind of different and you get it in a conversation ; listen to him .
i start there where the story started , 1985 , 1985 .
today , before you <unk> , who owns the opportunity to take a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re trying to fix is , are the effects of <unk> , things that were actually installed in the <unk> .
we did this . he got <unk> .
we found out later that in this region , the cause of disease is the cause of disease and death .
there is one thing that we &apos;ve done with all the time , the <unk> mandela said , &quot; how slavery and defeating <unk> is not <unk> . it &apos;s a work of people . it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t know if you call me a <unk> . really not .
it sounds really <unk> to say that , but if you try to do it , it &apos;s very impressive .
with that statement , i urge you to think that kids should not leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the recent <unk> <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> of bronx .
this is an image from the mayor of the bronx who <unk> the children in his house , not in prison , so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you <unk> big kids with little <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create this responsibility under <unk> .
now you may wonder about these children .
hold kids from those shops .
stephen <unk> : a schoolteacher that &apos;s south bronx
secondly , i assure you that even you see , as a <unk> , you see the difference here , right after that sharp line .
by 10 : <unk> suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine headaches , who <unk> an <unk> with <unk> neurons -- here in red neurons -- it &apos;s in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we have this .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- an <unk> acronym -- for the treatment of other <unk> .
lawyers are taking place in <unk> in the hopes of <unk> in <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> to the poor patient with compassion .
and a year ago , a year ago , four and a half ago were about &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> .
where do you know what &apos;s important about it ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i have the first time <unk> to bring it here .
these people in the <unk> i call <unk> , because they are really excluded from the process to share their knowledge .
they intend to use <unk> as a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> , which is about to teach teachers to teach teachers to teach teachers .
yes , books that might be sold 100 or 1,000 dollars a year .
it doesn &apos;t seem surprising , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of <unk> are over , when people say , &quot; so we &apos;d like to have three or <unk> of it in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a couple thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s kind of like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ $ 100 laptop that you can &apos;t do .
and this is the <unk> .
they click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all like , &quot; i love lucy , &quot; i love lucy , and we can &apos;t compete .

that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first of all , prevent the <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray , at the age of four to 22 years , you take yourself to the childhood , which is to show you what this graph shows .
the idea that her father was singing in the public , and it was enough to <unk> them .
this is the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited to <unk> the <unk> museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that it stayed there online , 24 hours a day .
but in the night , while we were <unk> , i asked the <unk> , as the <unk> decided they would kiss sam .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family works for four generations in the business .
honestly , i have no idea what it was with <unk> , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you see in the <unk> is the terrible force of the <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> to my leg , it takes me up , bringing me up to a vehicle , and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the floor .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct world with the world .
it &apos;s easy to see technology as a metaphor of memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> like technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you , corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , in every community that &apos;s already going to widen .
i led three <unk> <unk> at antarctica .
but tell me where you are , and what country they belong . &quot;
we &apos;ve also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important type of birds for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we as the rest of the world are faced with a problem .
he coined the term &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and of course , the <unk> and the open seas of the open seas , but the <unk> that everybody wants to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge <unk> and giant <unk> .
now there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , <unk> <unk> for a lot of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no way , no reference , no one response to it , but if you &apos;re a <unk> , you say , &quot; well , what are the data ? &quot;
instead , he has very carefully documented what happens when technology is going to be happening in an area of an environment and in a community .
so there is , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> painting .
i mean , it was at least as i did happy .
now , of course , there was a question of course that a while i was in a <unk> while , you know , can i do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less from those who i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is on it .
you &apos;re standing in a terrible situation without the way .
they &apos;re going to <unk> in hospitals .
as a <unk> , for example , i was considered to look at extremely excellent <unk> , because i know the <unk> <unk> , and i know how i have to use <unk> , and i can quickly work with the <unk> work .
i &apos;ve got this value of older people in so many of my friends that are in her &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , and the &apos; 90s , the &apos; 90s , was still active as <unk> , farmers and doctors .

<unk> : there must be something we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group itself identified itself as extremely identified .
<unk> <unk> : islam <unk>
let &apos;s see it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this one .
and when i started designing the design , i was kind of curious about myself .
so you have the eye , and then the concepts are going to .
but of course china has a tremendous population .
but what it shows is that this kind of visualizing information is a form of <unk> .
it &apos;s actually a pleasure to deal with them because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato ? so there &apos;s two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after a few months of searching , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same thing that &apos;s going on .
this is the basis for the device that two people built by ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things that i &apos;m going to pay attention to .
and she was actually not an idea of the context where she had landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say , no , not my mom , nor my father , not my sister , my brother , my aunties , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my grandparents .
i reports reports . i reports reports , just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage that i wanted to do . that was one , my family , to write poems .
and this is how we look for you .
and then you &apos;re hoping that one of us is walking around and find little bits .
and he had a <unk> , and it has to be <unk> by others , female , and probably a lot of small family members could be <unk> at his age of 12 .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation , or is it going to lead us to the fact that we &apos;re going to be the legitimate kind of going on on planet earth ?
but will we do that , or are we going to let the nature of their run ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was going to buy my office in a store for <unk> . i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> .
that meant a fundamental shift to me .
my co-author : about 70 layers of layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you know how possessed me ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far as far as i went to ebay a chinese newspaper from the san francisco to buy the bird in the <unk> .
when we looked down the way we looked at the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect <unk> : the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever run again , it &apos;s just a <unk> . &quot;
and i remember that my father was looking at me in the wheelchair , and i was <unk> by the top down to the bottom and the first time the sun was on my face .
they told me , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for them . &quot;
she passed me up to me the <unk> , and i called the school school , and i said , i &apos;d like to love a <unk> book .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up at the top .
i &apos;m in the world , but i work in my work .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> of a richard serra .
like the hell i want to do a phone in three weeks , if i &apos;ve developed these things over millions of years ?
each of these elements you could hang on the walls as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the highest taxpayer in british .
i look at the individual <unk> and how they flow -- it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s based on furniture &apos;s furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s made of aluminum <unk> as opposed to aluminum .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels for me of course .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from kevlar .
and the same after i did my dr. job , i was lucky to be a member of a <unk> that used to be used for the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these <unk> .
it uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> to the animals that are blind to animals that are blind to the red light , and you can see it without being seen .
so they use it to make food and partners .
i urge you to call them a different science that &apos;s used for hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i went to rediscover the value of consciousness .
and on june 5th , i heard a loud bang at the wheel of the wheel that had changed my life and the <unk> .
and there &apos;s the <unk> again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the effects of <unk> on the lives of birds .
so , if i -- for example , this is the sound of purple .
depending on how i <unk> it , i can listen to the dinner music and i &apos;m talking .
one of them is , &quot; i have a <unk> , &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is from hitler .
now , you know , you can always see more and more frequently that former <unk> are the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything you could be used to use . &quot;
absolutely critical .
what happens if teachers want to enforce ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t like the law , why don &apos;t you dare to do the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom has been a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here is the hardest world and the biggest change : we need to be the authority for interpretation and use of law to fight and officials .
a free society takes red and green lights , otherwise they &apos;re going to suffer from <unk> gridlock .
<unk> boundaries for the interest that can compute <unk> , and for the taxes that they can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard round columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job job .
he was just a <unk> .
but the problem with rules and incentives , is that they <unk> the professional activity , and they <unk> the professional activity in two ways .
so smart <unk> are better than anything , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that there can be some smart <unk> that can sustain forever forever .
why has this idea ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to <unk> the mentality that we -- america and the rest of the world -- that had happened .
this was <unk> , the turtle .
so we have to do this with a complete <unk> .
what i want to show you is what you need to do to transport 21 pounds to the <unk> of <unk> .
what if they had a nuclear weapon ?
and we come down and get the trucks that you just saw , somewhere in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> self is overwhelmed by a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me from someone who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , and the fact is that america had hard .
there &apos;s a lot of black sheep out there that are doing the wrong things and the problems that have happened .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous environment .
imagine if we could , we could , because if we could do it , we could achieve more .
the governments that make most progress are the governments that have found the ways to enable you , shared value , rather than the government to see the actor that &apos;s going on .
maybe i can cut down here the brain , and i can change the brain .
i want to kind of zoom in .
come on a moment with me in the 19th century , right in june 24th .
we certainly could all be productive when facebook or twitter or twitter would not cost so much time .
they <unk> <unk> on the british government to get money for the building of babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines have tremendous implications for society .
these benefits , these benefits , not only less wealthy men , but they also <unk> to look beyond the <unk> , instead of trying to answer the <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
once you start looking at the very little stuff -- this person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all those are not old enough , they have no idea how this infection happened -- namely by these <unk> .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency in which you can find each of the <unk> letters from random to a random text .
wherever life is , you will have this distribution , unlike that distribution .
too hot , too .
the officer asks , &quot; are you safe ? hey <unk> , are you sure you lost this ? &quot;
these are the data from one survey to <unk> in a single district in zambia , by a few years ago , by a few years ago , i have a few years ago .
as you can see , bruce , <unk> , a lot more hair .
you could be able to talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had time , or it was in my plan , and i &apos;m not sitting on vacation .
rather than teaching people how to put the paper on the cell phone , we should develop a software that lets you do to do the self without exercise , without exercise .
this is less than i was at that time when i went back to two weeks as a <unk> .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
this can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
i promised myself , i promised that next time i would spend the world , no fuel will be to be independent from fossil fuels to be safe to be safe , not to be endangered .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane who can talk to the universities who can talk to students with politicians who can talk to politicians in the flight , and make it really a human adventures .
and what &apos;s the goal ?
this is the reason why all people believe in this belief is to be , welcome to this team .
now you need a laptop .
anyway , for us africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is is what this problem is and what it isn &apos;t .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second .
the fact is that we &apos;re the first generation to see the disease , and this extreme of poverty in the eyes , they look across the ocean , saying it , and you don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s about nerves .
this year , this year is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the <unk> states who are asked to look at the world .
people find that slowly .
and with this one campaign , as our chute chute , my organization , data , and other groups of the energy and the enthusiasm from hollywood to the <unk> and the enthusiasm from hollywood to the north of america .
: step forward , step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a teacher , a housewife , and life saved .
the idea that the internet has changed all their lives , a country can transform -- and a continent that &apos;s going to be able to analog to digitally , let alone , to digital -- grabbed my head .
lips are no lips , but volcanoes .
now , your job is to see what these shapes is , and what &apos;s kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just <unk> , then this sentence , literally , is wrong .
if we &apos;re going to solve a problem or something new , we compare that what we already know about , what &apos;s unknown to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
it doesn &apos;t fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how do you deal with it , you personally , but also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three and a half .
this is a list of side effects : if you &apos;re too much salt eating food like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you &apos;re going to land in intensive care .
but soon i showed the symptoms for <unk> and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably would never see my home .
and i sat there , and i was talking about little excited with the <unk> for <unk> and asked him what i needed , could be ready to prepare me .
i got on a dozen machines that thought of life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> is also in the u.s. about 200 percent .
and also , the same thing is that the same business that &apos;s sold to us is that the 80 million pounds of atrazine is <unk> , including the same company .
we also launched as a <unk> .
what would our kids would tell us when every day , when every day , i had a little <unk> , some artificial <unk> <unk> , and a little bit of <unk> .
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , most of our villages .
here you see from the <unk> <unk> next to los angeles .
i offered five cents for every <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks at the foot of an elephant , and the largest part of you are hidden .
they look out of their <unk> and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwoods have a tremendous surface of redwood trees that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to be something called <unk> .
<unk> is giving the <unk> stability , just like a cathedral , and they &apos;re helping to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see that .
but recently , all the doors are open to open up and break the walls .
that was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s start looking at the <unk> <unk> .
what do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see how we work -- like <unk> work -- and try to find a way that we meet , to move forward .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> / d b , and if you open up this image image on your computer , this program will be done and ran .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the gecko is <unk> .
we need to find any way to make sure that all of the things that keeps the computer .
but i have nothing to do with that .
this is the person around <unk> .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does his future look like ?
these forces disappeared , nobody <unk> the 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and this kind of computations would take seriously and participate , because this would change things , but it would change things in two ways .
so that means that we can see a copy of ourselves , if you &apos;ve been using a piece of <unk> , that &apos;s what happens in motion of motion , and it &apos;s got worse and <unk> .
and the happy pair , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from her <unk> , and saw her video film suddenly had spread as a <unk> .
thank you .
you will go into the distance .
that &apos;s what he taught was to do when he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor love , who taught me how to be <unk> .
what is it driving in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you do , and let it happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . i didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
at this moment , it knows or unconsciously . at the moment , where you cling to you focus on something , you can <unk> your meaning and whatever it means , it makes emotions .
have you ever done something , and i went to , &quot; i was ! &quot;
to death . so , god , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need .
but this is true . we need it . we can do it by intimacy , through prayer , by <unk> , by <unk> in nature .
and there are seven different sensations . i can &apos;t go through them because i &apos;m feeling . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in the <unk> area , someone in new york , who would have died if he had been the day at the day , and this man , who was a terrorist , and it was clear .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating tools that are creating a large number of people who can tell their stories , people around the world .
the color of particles is like , happy , positive feelings have colored colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts running , and there are thousands of emotions that were collected .
ten of the things out and circle the time capsule .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
and we can click on this <unk> image of betty ford ford , as she walked the <unk> for her husband .
you can look at quotes , if you like to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel clouds as something that stands in the way .
in the life , it has tens of thousands of members in nearly 100 countries around the world .
you just need one step out of the outside , and what you &apos;re looking at is the usual so banal is so banal that everyone else is missing .
so look at high , admire the short-lived beauty , and you always think about the head of the clouds in the clouds .
those hundred shots have been <unk> , &quot; <unk> , good , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> . it was a giant machine .
this footage comes from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see the knife in the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen that has built in its inner very , very rapid <unk> .
so this is a really interesting project .
so it does .
so very talented people .
i went to the children as often as possible to bring the academic stuff to the real world with the real world .
it &apos;s not all everything , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into details why we imagine the universe , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain physics that we know .
throughout the course of my career , i always <unk> something .
in 2001 , i attended them during a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this shows the first one in the year in 2004 .
and he &apos;s just a moment ago , graduated from <unk> , and was recently shot with someone you all know .
each will have a <unk> <unk> , but in different scientific disciplines .
i got my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he claims this is the most beautiful brain that he ever scanned .
so on the next few slides i &apos;m going to explain to you .
transistors will be smaller to enable that , and that &apos;s what our technology is doing better .
our <unk> is behind this lens .
i had such a gut feeling that we do it wrong .
so in that sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
so we can see more in our galaxy more detail than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff out there .
it pulls on a page much more powerful than the other and the cloud gets apart .
and i hope that i have convinced you that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between stairs and cars and fire baseball .
so for example , people liked the 11th of the 11th that ended up like this .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , about the big &quot; what &quot; in the inside , god and <unk> .
through new and improved instruments , the age of <unk> .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings over time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new <unk> .
and the year 1945 , they brought it to 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where to begin .
wow , one volunteers , great .
but recently , my interest was , in fact , my interest in a new way of looking at a new point of view , because there &apos;s circumstance where this is really cool .
well , i think this is the <unk> development of a phenomenon we call crowd-accelerated innovation .
but the concept of desire is really the most important thing .
we get incredible talks about you .
let me introduce you to this point sam <unk> .
but even if you <unk> the screen , there &apos;s a lot more <unk> than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s going to happen right now .
like <unk> diffusion of innovation .
first of all , i have to be a service of the audience to talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , rather than saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re fun to design their own , personal tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them .
they hold them alive and give them the sugars , as a kind of <unk> , which we call superpower .
this kind of testing , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought , he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and in the areas of transparency , choices and <unk> , where people are really empowered .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon <unk> , claims all over the world are more pictures of their head than anyone else .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers would be <unk> and rewarding as helpful as helpful as helpful as the helpful to make sense in particular areas where a <unk> sense .
so i wish everyone a nice weekend .
and to write the dna and writing them , is always easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do ? &quot;
if you &apos;ve got <unk> around the world , it can lead to a <unk> , who is allowed to deliver biotechnology .
the kingdom claims , his laws allow him to , strangers or <unk> , which is an economic risk or a health care or a risk of health in the state of state .
these laws are a <unk> on the face of science and based on prejudice and ignorance and a heritage of traditions and an oven .
why are you pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 people affects people who inject drugs .
so the social worker , the social worker , they distribute condoms at risk , not from the police , <unk> or <unk> .
there were children born , people died there .
office office are already obsolete now .
they tracked the high line , the street <unk> , the river below the street , and they come from one end to the other , without cross the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
also , fortunately , are shared jobs .
your liver gets <unk> oil .
and they killed 12,000 sharks at the time , by just a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> bay .
we know very little about them .
so that tag will find the place of a shark , depending on the time , depending on the time and the sunset , the temperature and depth .
so let &apos;s take a look at the <unk> , which has been passed to the genes that are passed on the genes , then we see basking sharks , compared to the first one , a factor of 10 diversity than others .
so hannah <unk> this research and found out that the size of the <unk> lies .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build this . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists , whether it was a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the <unk> .
your body are <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re determined to be used for using any <unk> to make money -- people tell many of these stories .
no business do no business .
my journalism may not fit in other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it works . is about corruption , asking people , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be <unk> .
and had these people ever met a victim ?
nowadays , in 29 states , in more than half of the country , for more than half of the country , are fired fired .
at some point i understood that my mission was to photograph my mission , because there was a million different <unk> of <unk> .
at least i hope it will be harder to get their human rights .
first , the world is , and it will always be good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and thirdly , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that had made the soldiers .
in three ways , the prevailing kind of meaning is authority .
this is stanley <unk> , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust happen , right ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when he &apos;s doing something ? &quot;
stanley did , by the way , both of 1954 , the high school , at the james <unk> <unk> in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the other . <unk> of self .
alexander <unk> says the border between good and evil through the heart of a human race .
and i put this experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anybody could do , &quot; no big thing on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that &apos;s really hard to be .
we have a self .
but on my left , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> which is labeled by the red arrow .
there &apos;s just a <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not saying anything , except that it wants to be scary .
and the autobiographical itself is heightened by memory , thinking , imagination &apos;s imagination .
thank you . thank you . thank you for the <unk> -- <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m going to make it ridiculous , because i think feminism is partly to admit , to admit , the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
now you have to see , i haven &apos;t put myself on fire .
she talked about <unk> , she founded <unk> , they organized <unk> , they <unk> friends -- all these everyday acts of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s different from the homo sapiens of the former <unk> .
in fact , this is a sensor that reads the electrical activity in my brain while i read this talk .
we <unk> numerous prototypes and products for life to control like <unk> appliances or a <unk> chair .
the headset is wirelessly , wirelessly connected with a ipad or smart .
how these kids are able to use their new awareness of their recovery , a lot of the damaging and <unk> social <unk> , which people who are being detected as different is to see .
they understand the power of the human narrative and that &apos;s the value we <unk> on people , changing , <unk> and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my capabilities and my possibilities .
<unk> , and quite unexpected , they gave up .
so this specialist didn &apos;t stop looking at my eyes .
i was going to know that i &apos;m good .
and quite slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in me , not all of me , not all of me , all of the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole .
what we have , is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with just a little change in the posture , feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that has to take place which is about the measure of control , which we have about our <unk> .
for <unk> percent of this money , you could have install <unk> in the trains , which doesn &apos;t have the duration of the journey , but what &apos;s the pleasure and the usefulness of a lot more improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the entire one of the top of the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is going to understand the field of economics as a <unk> discipline .
well , the average response would be in 50 to 60 percent .
it &apos;s going to <unk> them that they may not hurt themselves .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i had a coin with both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had inherited , actually , very powerful effects of children around the world , and now people every ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful that wants to live forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and i &apos;ve got <unk> .
this is actually the score of the <unk> piece that he &apos;s completely composed in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a <unk> .
there &apos;s actually the present self once .
i have to write five pages on a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is , the last <unk> machine , is something i created with hal <unk> , which i was introduced to me with my co-author in a previous project called bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people , because when one of the faces smiles , the other face is <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s one of the reasons that so much of what we think of western science , mathematics and <unk> , actually in the first few centuries of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> developed .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not &quot; sh . &quot;
so it &apos;s not surprising that if you talk to people from mental illness , you probably suffer stories from <unk> , shame and discrimination in almost all walks of life .
a little more than 30 years ago , the nations gathered around the world in <unk> and gave this legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about fish .
if you look at this race , you &apos;ll see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are in fact .
and that was in the early stages of <unk> when india was driving <unk> -- as a means for the recovery -- after china -- after china -- after china -- by eight , 10 , 10 percent looked at and asked : why can &apos;t we do it ?
these are not <unk> , but they have trust and the courage and the courage to say , &quot; that &apos;s what we calculated .
green carbon , so emissions emissions from deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon form together 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things were like , dick , but not by the way .
i also liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said , he had basically had the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed all the <unk> , and the <unk> color , which is just a fantastic <unk> .
many of these ideas are <unk> to airstream , <unk> <unk> .
if you think about it , your children are sending to the tinkering school , they &apos;re going to come back with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
but let me play it under their own conditions , and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that you can &apos;t learn from the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you want to throw away a device , don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all this . this is number <unk> . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife , four months after the aspen , in aspen , and in a good way .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not just sharing the parts ?
this is one of the seven things that are the ones that were not fired into all the shot .
and so it came out in the years of western europe , and they began to buy , at first , thousands of , then hundreds of thousands of individual , and then to print a million of individual , a piece of the hell of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as a edison bulb , it looked like this .
you have to be quite smart , and although i don &apos;t have a <unk> , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m dumb , because you can &apos;t be dumb to be dumb and it in the world .
they literally <unk> the door .
if you listen to the <unk> of your listening , both ears are both <unk> .
we have the problem that the antenna antenna .
again , thank you again .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her to her particular map , and she wrote her name on her name , <unk> her .
i &apos;m sure i can see , i can see the <unk> .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and limited life on this earth precisely with <unk> .
in that mode , he &apos;s trying to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;d tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we &apos;re going to think about future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids , where they have different charge of charges .
and through a sequence of <unk> , you can draw one out of a billion fish , which is what you want , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see <unk> coming out .
if you ask people the question , where do you go when they do something important ?
i sat on my desk , using my expensive computer .
so what happens -- sometimes you have a few days that you wakes up at eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or seven or when you get up , and you say , oh , i didn &apos;t get good at night .
in the office , most of these are the <unk> and distractions that people actually prevent from work , <unk> .
we all know that this is true . you never have a <unk> meeting that &apos;s going to be <unk> by staff .
meetings and managers are now the two main main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , the week week , the week that anyone can talk about .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this for seven years , and i have no idea how the future will look like .
but if you ask people to ask the three important things that you carry on , no matter what culture , what gender and what context -- say , most people , money , and if you have one , the mobile phone .
but this is a very big , but we have to forget the tendency .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of <unk> and then -- the owner of the player &apos;s 10 or 20 percent <unk> , and there &apos;s the rest of the <unk> bar on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and it &apos;s kind of an appreciation for the value of <unk> .
at the same time with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story that we &apos;ll tell about .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research findings that show how to impact the <unk> of healthy people on genetic level , and saying that , if we live healthier , better food , exercise and more love to breed .
until i tell you who said it .
within that framework , we can feel regret over many different things .
when i went home , i went home , after i had gotten my tattoo , i stayed nearly all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s a fifth .
i mean , even the dumb thing , the answer to all of us , let &apos;s leave the <unk> for days .
and as i used to say , i am a <unk> .
i thought i &apos;d try to prepare my ted wish to try and do what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to fit what they &apos;re trying to do .
not in india . now there &apos;s at least half a million active .
and i thought the thought that anyone in this world must be thinking about the organization of the <unk> .
and so we did that .
listen to this : less than four 10th of one percent of those who were treated , they were used to use their medicine or <unk> in <unk> ways .
it &apos;s an attempt , and i think it would be successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
if the <unk> is used , you will create 8,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
<unk> women from cooking cooking food , and they use secrets , they &apos;re using secrets that are just their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and studied it .
green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords were still healthy and not <unk> . &quot;
then apple alex <unk> , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was one reason that i was .
the <unk> isn &apos;t naturally .
but it &apos;s not about that .
initially , the internet was a <unk> tool , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave for my real , everyday life .
it &apos;s human disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , you know .
before i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
we used two <unk> pages as a single side , because the readers will be true .
so what is the lesson ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not running .
it <unk> and terrible things happen to me .
all lost the hope in my cure .
so they went to their <unk> and all the <unk> furniture furniture -- they gave me the pots and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away this road is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight car , and you had a terrible accident , and they had a horrible accident that she was carrying .
i thought that there was some reason for some reason , and just for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of the molecular structures .
he took me with the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we &apos;ve got all symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it because i have a little bar installed , right ?
if i move a magic train , and then one , it makes a third one .
galois has set up a series of rules , like these charts , these symmetries .
one of the symmetry we call <unk> .
instead of all the clutter , i want to know , how many digits you have , ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects , basically -- i &apos;m sorry for me .
first , richer diet , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison had a very <unk> company in a company .
penicillin was discovered in penicillin , but even in 1940 , they were not <unk> <unk> .
it was the origin of the <unk> , which was last year last year .
for me , the study of unintended consequences , that chaos is happening now . let &apos;s do the best one .
it works in every computer and the browser . minus , minus , minus and the text gets smaller .
they don &apos;t need to break it down .
and therefore , it &apos;s a kind of source of information that i &apos;m inspired , my real desk .
so a means about it would be a little bit like a <unk> , so that you get to get the more traditional desktop , and the things are <unk> on the grid .
now i &apos;m going to get to the heart of my music , and there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor . and with such a sign , i want to suggest today that we want to suggest the role of contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just <unk> , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists on wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them , this is a book on flies , which you might have on amazon <unk> .
these are not <unk> ; it &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually interesting .
we go . shake . it &apos;s noisy .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> traffic lights , so with <unk> , save a lot of life , but there &apos;s an excess of them .
the answer is to allow cars to be safe from that side of the street .
warren buffett had been denied : honestly to say , &quot; well , what &apos;s going to do and to make this a year .
in fact , we see that the only known disease is that the only known disease is because of the africa in africa , people have evolved to get several things around the <unk> .
this means that the economy in these areas are <unk> , because it &apos;s just so much .
but that &apos;s not a <unk> .
not only one was weak ; she &apos;s getting weaker .
a teacher of the top quartile is the power of his class -- measured by <unk> -- in a year by 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and these free courses could not just be available to the internet , but you can also get <unk> everywhere , so everyone can have access to an <unk> teachers who have the best teachers who have the best teachers .
common vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
sculptor richard serra , as young artist thought he was a painter , he was a painter and he lived in florence .
when i look at these pictures , i wipe the smoke at my clothes when i went back to my family , and i went home to my family .
my parents were mad . they said , &apos; we know you have fear , but let &apos;s go tomorrow tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us so powerful ?
this is a major general general in boston .
the pathologist takes the lens , <unk> it , <unk> it , looking at it under the microscope and the operating room .
so in this kind of suite , a solution with these <unk> molecules , combined with a dye , shown here in red , injected into the <unk> of one cancer may not separate blood .
with <unk> lymph node , as part of our present , the surgeon is looking at the surgeon , the lymph node , where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause it , and pain .
if we <unk> these two samples ...
we know that this is doable , and we &apos;re determined to do this .
and this cell is a thousand different types of <unk> that we learn .
it &apos;s going to affect the normal circuits that the sick they want to fix .
and one in the morning in the summer of 2004 , we tried it , and it didn &apos;t work for the first time .
so we have shown that there &apos;s a short amount of cells that &apos;s going to be able to use learning .
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story that we think might find clinical trials .
so you can see that the animal actually can actually turn the walls and the little platform , and they can use his eyes again .
buildings are <unk> with the air <unk> microbes that <unk> through the windows and <unk> .
and if you stop out there , the air contains microbes that are associated with <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i &apos;m a physically physically person , as you can see , so i had no worry about this thing 20 blocks to wear .
same thing for the question of who is the streets of september 11th in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;m experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract word and look at google after google , and then you &apos;re looking for these results after the name of somebody .
this is <unk> <unk> . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , you can link one most .
what we all about 40 years ago -- the story of stories between generations -- is rare .
in 1939 , in 1939 , the film older than most of our members of our members .
did a story ?
why don &apos;t we interfere with the same passion as reading ?
in california , they &apos;re sent to a <unk> : &quot; this product includes chemicals , which is from the state of california as the state of cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so we might be able to develop a <unk> that requires , and for my job as an architect as an architect , it &apos;s an accident that the words &quot; humility , &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; the eternal <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was : &quot; the stone didn &apos;t end because they run stones . &quot;
and that can be very , very good for berlin , but we stop <unk> in houston , and all the windows are closed , and with all the products that were not designed to use in transportation , is actually a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you are using it .
since we &apos;ve got the 4,000 <unk> of the most frequent <unk> in a database that we &apos;re going to provide the public health of the public .
now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the internet .
and we started to make commercial use of buildings , so that all people are centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . don &apos;t let anyone tell you that we all knew it &apos;s because we didn &apos;t know .
for instance , they &apos;re going to spend the <unk> on microsoft &apos;s ninth 11th , yahoo at the 12th of march of 2008 , and then the other one : google , skype , skype and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden are similar laws like the united states .
and whoever is telling you , he didn &apos;t have to hide anything long enough .
their emails were read , and she was talking in the <unk> , and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no point of privacy , it can &apos;t give real freedom of freedom , and therefore no way to pass democracy democracy . &quot;
a lot of people , if you see a new human brain , say , &quot; usually it looks different when you &apos;re presented with a brain . &quot;
all these empty fields are the areas that are going through the <unk> .
and the nature of a particular cell is to make sense of what the 25,000 of the 25,000 genes are turned on , and what the 25,000 genes are turned on , and what are they turned on .
now , experts are coming into the game and do some basic anatomical .
so we take the kind of stuff , and we put it on a <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their whole genomes and they &apos;re trying to find <unk> , which are associated with genes .
whether these individual genetic background depends on their experiences , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how we can <unk> poverty , we need to do more ?
so here are a few more questions .
how can you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
well , it was all right .
and it &apos;s done many experiments that came all the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to move the politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small , with things where we &apos;re safe .
poverty is more powerful than scientific work , and lack of data , and lack of data about the effects of <unk> , the question of <unk> , and <unk> esther , and <unk> esther , i mean , <unk> <unk> .
so , we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in a way .
and the legend reported that alexander &apos;s <unk> through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with a thousand languages , and it wouldn &apos;t move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to discuss this from the perspective of <unk> .
in tanzania , last week the standard standard were the standard of <unk> <unk> .
if i had to ask them , &quot; what was in the year in 2005 of the world &apos;s biggest performance ? &quot; would you think of egypt ?
because there are fascinating possibilities .
&quot; god , &quot; is the journey we all want to be inspired to be inspired and to feel one with the universe .
you &apos;re <unk> a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought they were .
i &apos;m going to run this way to make that kind of thing , and i &apos;m going to describe it to my response , when i first saw this .
all right .
ok , switch , raise your right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no , no . i just see the street .
i couldn &apos;t see the blindfold .
once again .
kb : how many times you felt ?
so let &apos;s close your eyes , in five , four , three , one .
only if you want the pressure released , they &apos;re going to make a <unk> , so , but only if you want the pressure released .
do you want to try it ?
right now , they feel a certain sense , and if you feel the feeling , i want you to throw the <unk> into the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . do you think he &apos;s here , right ?
first of all , this is keith barry , how our brain can <unk> our bodies -- with a trick that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and then he does the audience in some <unk> <unk> of the brain magic .
me <unk> .
it &apos;s not for the &quot; one of <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s for all four .
i witnessed that both religious and <unk> people are equally obsessed with morality .
the <unk> is almost at zero , if there &apos;s no <unk> for a <unk> .
and then you get this message from the computer : &quot; person gave them a lot of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin increases <unk> <unk> to 80 percent .
i just found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
experiments we have to give men testosterone .
that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new few of them .
and it &apos;s very easy to motivate a brain to <unk> .
to bring the device to run the machine , you need lots , many , many people .
or don &apos;t you want it ?
they said quite <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only in english , so we taught ourselves english , so we can use english to use it . &quot;
i decided to break my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
nonsense . but i had to follow the emergence of this .
what will tomorrow be ?
we need to undo this imbalance by <unk> .
i think it &apos;s right here .
i &apos;ve asked incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will they end ? &quot;
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i &apos;m not lost the thread .
<unk> went to the local <unk> in uttar pradesh , and found that he was led to the official <unk> as he passed away .
so this area is <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged layer of numbers that &apos;s able to pay several numbers of numbers and several households , which is common .
so after these four children , you see <unk> younger sister who had been killed by their children .
and finally , there was one single one that was sitting for me sitting in front of me , and later it was , and he had to <unk> him , so i had to <unk> him .
at the age of 16 , kids have to leave the orphanage , even though they &apos;re not anywhere .
one of the interesting things is , of course , is the combination of the naked hand and the technology , and of course , what he &apos;s told about is the listening to our young people .
now my career could continue a little longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes through the chamber .
or we do this , and we think that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual limb . but why can &apos;t i do that when i learn a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> shows the dove , <unk> <unk> , why listening to music much more powerful than sound sound to make sound more than sound .
and it was so big , until the point where it was a <unk> last year at <unk> <unk> , rick <unk> and rick <unk> &quot; millions of people on tv .
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky enough to be <unk> .
peace and love mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what to do .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to achieve their maximum height and all these habitats .
we &apos;re like the dinosaurs very , and are unusual in our <unk> attitudes .
so basically , it &apos;s a country that &apos;s not <unk> at the beginning of our work .
this is an adult carcass in his pine tree .
paul has never seen a fossil react .
these are all <unk> . there &apos;s a range of possibilities .
i became an artist and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;re dealing with this question for centuries -- how to address these children in science .
bad news for derartu tulu is -- some other kings had the same idea that the olympic <unk> and paula radcliffe , which is a tremendous , with just the fastest <unk> of all time .
show me an animal with <unk> and the gills , it has to do something with water .
we don &apos;t put our physical strength because we &apos;re the largest <unk> in the jungle .
now emily <unk> -- one of 500 <unk> and <unk> -- she ends up the best 10 , even the best 10 , even though she went to <unk> her baby &apos;s baby -- and <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s all we could do .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
listen to the focus on these <unk> , which you failed , if you need four hours .
it was all sorts of things that went to interact with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be , of course , and helping people really want to accept robots as part of our everyday life .
cookie cookie monster is very , very bad .
the <unk> was a <unk> of our group in which they used three to three different technologies to interact with the patient .
and with this technology , they can become active participants in their lives , in a way that it &apos;s not possible .
and third possibility was a simple experiment with paper and pen , because that &apos;s the <unk> that normally used to use if you start a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is this idea of <unk> replication of the character .
i was , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s not going to be <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
running away , not too far . i fire , &quot; bam ! &quot; the <unk> fall between two cars .
when he wrote a <unk> , i was front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and film , but i also do <unk> books and a little bit of ads , all the same concept .
from photography , this <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> , and what you can &apos;t have , you want to have more .
how you care about collective consciousness , without that we know that we know it , and what happens .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you turn the photograph , at which he wakes up , and suddenly it becomes quite serious and maybe less accessible .
eighty-five percent of global health care of disease is in the developing world -- not in the west -- and yet , 90 percent of the means in the west .
easy to treat . look at the situation in the island .
but when you tell them , we &apos;re trying to do the same thing in nigeria , then all the time .
it allows the existence of <unk> centers , and we can use the experience very smart .
you have to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important .
and we &apos;re starting a <unk> technical program so that we can <unk> local people who can fix the equipment .
and autism has a very large bandwidth , from very massive -- the child &apos;s not developed language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
<unk> love i love the film , like all my projects , this is the <unk> in me .
well , what i learned early was because i wasn &apos;t so <unk> to sell my work and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a <unk> problem .
this is called <unk> <unk> .
i made <unk> during the <unk> , and i built things and learned how to do things work .
another very simplistic idea is to make the kids from some of the many of the <unk> <unk> for teaching .
tg : well , i have passion for the things that i do , is improving the world .
it &apos;s an augmented reality that &apos;s projections and connect systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i am standing at this coast , the <unk> <unk> , i think , again , and again , i &apos;m going to create it all the way that i &apos;m going to do all the way across the long , dangerous wilderness .
but it was deeper : how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our <unk> , that you never tell me how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all of these talk that i had <unk> , just to <unk> the <unk> , they were quite different .
thank you so much fun at the conference .
and this may be the <unk> , he lost his sense .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium is a whole bunch of new ideas ?
they had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew . otherwise you couldn &apos;t have the right kind of discussion .
but there was a programmer who decided that wasn &apos;t the best kind of work .
each of you can make changes , and they can <unk> them for <unk> work , even if they knew nothing about the existence of each other before .
this is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing here .
a little <unk> that can happen a culture , is that they can acquire a new <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right ?
don &apos;t try to improve what others do , because it doesn &apos;t get very far .
and if you tell somebody you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months at the best time season .
but we &apos;ve tested these rovers , before we put them up there -- or these one rover -- and they made sure everything works .
so we sent a space probe on the way to mars , which is phoenix . this probe is going to land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so they can put their clocks .
and that would be bad .
we are now talking as we &apos;re talking to the next rover that we want to send to mars .
and i know , many of you have , the last time that these are really cool things are really cool .
there were two <unk> that were particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s as much as the grain cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it &apos;s not water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk about how these exponential technologies are .
so we look at how exponential technology affects health .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there are wireless <unk> .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us be better with our patients and take more of us to focus on the key , human elements of medicine , through this kind of technology .
and the current trend in medicine is to be exponentially smaller .
come to genomics , as 10 years ago , the first human being conducted , was the cost of a billion dollars .
thanks to websites like <unk> like me or the <unk> of your data or google health , it will always be more important , all these possibilities in a <unk> way .
we used to use cells from the bone marrow , to treat a patient with a heart attack , and we found a improved <unk> and higher <unk> of their own <unk> cells to a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
their cats , god knows how many , that the amount of <unk> <unk> <unk> , their <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
as you cross the <unk> tiles , at the level of the street , <unk> , <unk> , i &apos;m not looking at , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was scared , a <unk> part of me would be in control , and i &apos;d be caught in the <unk> <unk> of her <unk> <unk> .
but i &apos;m afraid that <unk> comes from and show me his own .
if we love to love , she keeps around me around me , i &apos;m there .
we &apos;re looking for pictures that are going to empower the attention of critical topics , images that are the <unk> of the world , images that are inspiring to us , stand up and to act with other words .
in the &apos; 80s , the stigma was an enormous obstacle with this disease , an enormous obstacle to debate about this disease , or to mention it .
jonathan haidt : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books and <unk> and <unk> .
and i was able to see how i put the flag on the floor floor , well , <unk> , a <unk> moment , and the music ran on a <unk> .
finally , at the morning of the day of the day , we got the <unk> , we got the helicopter , two helicopter in <unk> -- that &apos;s the edge of the <unk> <unk> .
i knew there were more open water bodies , and i had a <unk> <unk> .
i had known that , but i was expected .
this is looking out of my tent when i got this <unk> call .
and just from the air i saw the big picture .
and they turned around and wanted to go back to shore , and all five died on the <unk> .
and that was a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but a few days later , we thought about our college students , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this was happening , if this isn &apos;t , if this isn &apos;t ?
one day in <unk> , <unk> miles off the coast of <unk> in one of the most remote parts of the pacific , saw 20 american <unk> of the sea .
but in a certain point , most of learning to give up these visions , and become an adult .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to be more likely to read more than others .
right ? is an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> in the world , a way of looking at a glimpse of the future , when time is time to influence .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them in every living room of the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated by their people , by the masses , and now we &apos;re going to collapse them to another .
thank you very much .
because what we discovered is that people care , and people want to be informed -- they receive the <unk> through our internet .
and , frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as a 22 miles of the row , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood .
you want to share a needle as little as you want to share a toothbrush yourself , even with someone you <unk> .
so this is an overview of hundreds of studies of all the high animals in the united states in the united states , and these are the studies that show that <unk> are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these terrible pictures from africa .
let me say , well , great <unk> .
ines a <unk> on the streets . she &apos;s a girl with a tail .
she was 105 years old when i made this photograph of her photograph .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo . here &apos;s a little <unk> .
we were with the car in <unk> , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just in the car .
let &apos;s try and do it with that old song , i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in the sky , i know .
originally from the <unk> <unk> , which later the <unk> was built , an instrument with <unk> bodies and <unk> where the sound emerges .
well , that &apos;s more simple than done .
we were not stupid : we were in about five feet a piece of plywood .
when <unk> were new , i thought , why can &apos;t you take the oldest <unk> rhythms , the <unk> rhythms , and you can combine them with the latest technique ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a ethics .

the <unk> is something that &apos;s kind of scary , and you probably know part of the <unk> .
fourteen thousand americans dying every day of asthma , three times like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he had no sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> are scared to market <unk> as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
secondly , because we have gotten extinct .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and pay people , every <unk> people that they saw .
he may think he would have the <unk> baby ever born , so he takes a little bit of help from outside .
i asked peter , whether something changed . and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
now , we want to talk to &quot; africa : &quot; the next chapter , &quot; and this is : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful africans .
but most of all , they need to be productive in their lives , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries that are going to be done .
we can combine it all together ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl between the legs of these people , and my sister at my sister to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything .
and often i don &apos;t see african staff among them .
now , the question is , how we can use to use all of this good will ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is a <unk> product , i took these principles , so we can study them , exactly how we can study any other complex neurological process .
the way has been applied since the 90s to explore extremely complex .
i want to try to show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in the shift .
now , how do you study rap ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity , which is involved in <unk> .
so i want to say that probability and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and <unk> .
that &apos;s very time-consuming , and isn &apos;t quite pleasant .
but keep the thoughts on the ages of eight seconds .
in games , virtual worlds , for example , can use their facial expressions , of course , and intuitively will be used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise it was very fast , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children are dying .
another statement of esther was that we respond when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s produced by <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in their <unk> &apos;s a very cheap laser .
audience : aye .
what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve got rid of all the time , we &apos;ve never done it , we &apos;ve never managed to <unk> the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant house house .
and this is the <unk> that you see here , actually , actually , actually , actually , in a sense of <unk> and <unk> .
so water is an important aspect .
&quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; the earth . &quot;
the idea is not yet .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
as soon as it touches water , you should hear the air out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the minimal genome of a <unk> species , it &apos;s supposed to be a smaller genome of it ?
moreover , we realized that once that worked , a real chance of the time , if we could get rid of the synthetic chromosome , it would bring the bacteria to the bacteria .
<unk> is <unk> .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; which i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand it . &quot;
but in fact , we live in the northwest , very close to the actual picture of the koran &apos;s the paradise of paradise , which is the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> by <unk> .
but the more you add more to be lost .
and that number of course never never come .
this is a nest &apos;s nest colony colony is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that &apos;s founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the <unk> -- this is supposed to represent a leaf -- they &apos;re an interesting group . they go early in the morning .
oddly enough , and interestingly , it looks like about half the ant &apos;s ant just doing nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the <unk> and put it to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and put it there .
they don &apos;t want to get out , not .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that are going to show the longer one ant out of the time , the more of the simple <unk> on its surface , and so they smell the ants that make them different work .
they cover all the earth , beyond antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of oil is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
this has nothing to do with it .
i thought about where we can use natural gas .
and when i got in the <unk> , it &apos;s got nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry ?
they were just 500 million <unk> .
it &apos;s never been eating water , or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . they &apos;re <unk> the world .
they &apos;re working in <unk> manhattan , where they built the first <unk> .
these were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to <unk> the light bulb .
and a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t just wait and wait , but then the <unk> , when they were there , for the third time , they had to calling somebody .
so , sometimes i &apos;m going to use a clinical language , and it &apos;s not going to be as warm as you will not be as warm as other talks about compassion .
and here is the basic idea that <unk> is good for people who are going to be <unk> .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend , or you belong to my family , i don &apos;t belong much less to you , the golden rule . okay .
so , you know , the results just raise . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of interdependence , <unk> , force one , the humanity &apos;s humanity .
and you &apos;ll explain them , the other people think they &apos;re not respected , and they want to dominate them , and they hate america .
most of the diseases involve poverty , but in the case of cancer , the kids seemed to have the children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
one week a child died , but nothing changed .
because you simply don &apos;t have this kind of energy and time it doesn &apos;t really care about it .
so he didn &apos;t really want something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant <unk> would tell you that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cancer cell , and that &apos;s a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
and we found a kind of <unk> material that actually contained the right extracellular matrix , and lo and look at the cells . within about four days , they have <unk> and on the right , what we &apos;ve created in a culture .
and of course , we &apos;re going to ask where we now go ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
and we &apos;ve got a <unk> journalist who was caught in <unk> ; a boy <unk> , whose book has a lot of <unk> <unk> , that you &apos;ve taken off the shelf ; a <unk> talk about fake <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you had four good friends of one person whose person is their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; they were talking to me , and they were on .
they were told how big the bath was , or they said , the <unk> are so far away from the hotel .
woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
also , you want to <unk> your eyes .
but it &apos;s really opened my eyes , how many times i &apos;ve gotten from life , social networks , social networks and so on , even though there was nothing very important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful tape of <unk> .
and every one that went <unk> , i ran behind .
at least for me , because if i always do the same , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very , very quickly .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see .
are nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
however , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s good , it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s just not <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> for too long <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
i call it the era of citizenship -- where people are different from different races or <unk> , but as citizens can be equal to the same as citizens .
and of course , i had been discovered in egypt .
this had been studied in london , in yemen , in the yemen , in amsterdam , to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and symbols and symbols that are using the democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , is a <unk> family of <unk> <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition that was <unk> for a political goal , and that was to remove the leaders .
these tools are going to be more socially interesting when they &apos;re getting very bored .
it <unk> the boundaries of the individual networks and then <unk> them .
and because of the social networking , the chinese students who studied studying the rest of the world , or companies from the rest of the world in china , there were people around the world that were heard .
and finally introduced the chinese to the chinese .
we &apos;re more in a media environment in the media globally , socially , <unk> and cheap .
but everything in particular , i &apos;m going to be , i &apos;m going to have as well as i did .
and at my fourth <unk> , everest , a comet , <unk> .
this view is the <unk> , the first 600 feet of the climb of base of base base .
and this is in camp .
and there were climbers on this ridge ridge .
and we also got the bad news that beck was <unk> , another climbers , in this storm collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so tricky to work up there , sometimes i even pink , directly through the clothing .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can just <unk> how he did this .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back into a lot of things .
these are sherpas who light <unk> .
and the fourth thing that really is meaningful , &quot; ideas that we need to share . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneur are the entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re carrying into great terms of society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy , because they bring ideas together , from the universal <unk> , parliament and the <unk> and so on .
the third thing is , again , the cities .
the second is the <unk> that we &apos;ve got to do the entrepreneurs that are so hard to create standardized jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs in the <unk> .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you &apos;ve got the chance to import a modern <unk> <unk> , so you don &apos;t have the <unk> , if you &apos;re older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important to india and importance for the world .
so the government decides the government to vote .
even though some people don &apos;t like to hear it , it actually was the revolution of the markets that <unk> the <unk> , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they &apos;re not terrified .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the <unk> and those who represent them .
<unk> .
each of these <unk> would be a statistically <unk> for two years .
david cameron spent 20 million pounds in a &quot; social <unk> fund . &quot;
<unk> <unk> : investment in social change
i work . &quot;
why ? are you too painful to get to the <unk> ?
even when i was my friend named jack there , i say , &quot; hi , jack . <unk> , jack , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t figured it out , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means i &apos;ve done everything you &apos;ve just heard and just done with my voice .
and lastly , with this one to my right , i can make my sound <unk> , <unk> , repeat .
our people had to take about 5,000 different pieces of <unk> to find the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to the people who could say that you can &apos;t create . anybody can do that .
on the right side , you see a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> <unk> .
his wife said , &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
so many of these patients are moving forward .
the results are better than the surgery .
he can stop the operation at any time and stop .
<unk> street , i know .
and that is where she &apos;s really much of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that runs in both directions .
and that &apos;s why you want to go to the next trend and as fast as possible as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , really work within that aesthetics .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time in court . and the <unk> decided that it would be much too expensive .
these are the two <unk> differences in the logic of the <unk> .
and i want to thank you in this place , <unk> <unk> , that they &apos;ve created this very distorted presentation .
once i took a boat to a <unk> <unk> , and i realized that the <unk> will be , not <unk> .
i think this is one of the <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there &apos;s been numerous ancient <unk> in the u.k. all over the u.k. , and if you take a <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> of the churches were there .

i hope that i can find these organisms , i can help to pay attention to their remarkable <unk> , and i can make my part of protecting your <unk> longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s put it into something else .
20 years later , <unk> <unk> are still using mobile phones , but they &apos;re also creating their own <unk> , like this , which is used by the <unk> in all 31 .

what could terrorists do now with terrorists now using technology ?
recently , the fbi has been arrested in the u.s. , who was arrested in the u.s. , who wanted these <unk> drones to transport in the u.s.

patient capital is uncomfortable for the people who are looking for simple solutions , mild categories , because we don &apos;t look at profit .
but the whole community , all of different <unk> , even the <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because when you &apos;re in the <unk> , it &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s green , you &apos;re eating the world , you &apos;re in the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make my wife a little joy .

in this way , education is very important .
<unk> , who &apos;s going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s basically no ponds of good teachers teachers . and only eight percent of the people of the county have a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty in creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the staff on wheels , then the team won .
now , in the last few decades , but a lot of money that was meant for a city , it was completely gone .
and the neighbors are going to interview , what &apos;s going to do for eating what they eat and from where and why , is a homework assignment .
it &apos;s literally impossible to create large <unk> spaces .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of <unk> and explore .
after four months , after four months , it &apos;s going to be eight months dry .
here &apos;s a few results .
this global act is going to lead to the same extent to climate change , maybe more than those fossil fuels .
when i learned from these two things , i was very much , both of personal reasons than scientific reasons .
it has a very well <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was part of the <unk> of the <unk> foundation .
after the treatment , let &apos;s make the child a series on a series of simple <unk> to see how to adapt vision .
the answer is , in motion , i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these <unk> , and hopefully hopefully more results .
and then i have these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i judgment on it , i look like this .
but it was in the fall of 95 , and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , you know aimee &apos;s aimee &apos;s <unk> , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i was trying to see anyone i could , <unk> , against whom , against whom am i performing here ?
i always had everything , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> . take it off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and designers are going to be <unk> 2 , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
she got somebody who came over and <unk> the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to detect the actual losses of the economy , unless we use math math .
or for the more 75,000 jobs .
and another thing about mathematics : mathematics looks like math -- like this -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in education education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three .
when people ask me , right ?
but automation in cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s another thing that &apos;s driving now is something else that &apos;s going to build a car and learn from his <unk> .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why that &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important to <unk> computers in the tests .
it was in the winter of 2009 , and i was blind to about a year .
and i thought specifically at my father , who passed away , because of the <unk> , of course .
similarly , just by the handle , just by the grasp of the <unk> of the land , the shifting of the land , and the time is going to make sense of where you are and what you &apos;re doing is where you &apos;re <unk> .
but when i was <unk> , and i was walking down the broadway , i was blessed to everyone .
if you design a city in the spirit of blind , many , many , many jobs .
and to give you a feeling of that experience , &quot; i think you &apos;ll be <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous ones i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next , be fertile and <unk> you ...
you give money for a good purpose and creating emotional limitations .
she &apos;s not a book that was written , and the sky was written by the sky .
so , this is the key to me , the key to me , to remember that , in the way , this is not <unk> , the cart &apos;s not <unk> , and i didn &apos;t come up with the stairs .
that was very inspiring to me .
so if we want to make any sense of that book , we really need to be about it , and it &apos;s really going to be <unk> .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics really thought that was to <unk> this work , so we developed <unk> applications like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> laser .
alex was working on a little , a little obscure , independent <unk> called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to design the interface with the film .
and we &apos;re going to have this <unk> operation by because we like yellow <unk> .
so let &apos;s pull it apart : i &apos;m teaching it in <unk> .
we , as people , are those things , and we should make sure that our machines are helping us and build .
john , thank you for <unk> <unk> .
what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technologies .
but here is the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that will be represented by this black line , said , &quot; we change these .
they &apos;re created by the members of each other .
and just like all the good <unk> , it &apos;s a leap of 20 years , when the interest changes the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so we got changes , and we started playing <unk> .
india didn &apos;t want to play the <unk> .
the other was <unk> cricket .
and this was the new india ? that was another world where you could get players from anywhere , as long as you could get the best player for the best prize .
we all had seen games in calcutta , but we had never seen before . <unk> <unk> <unk> the audience with a <unk> song -- for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that day ?
i hope i &apos;ve done each of them to make an experience richer and the game , and hopefully it &apos;s a long time for working in this business business .
and you know that the <unk> dogs is , because they &apos;re very fast in memory , as often they &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs on the leash .
why do anything in the world should make a fuck ?
on the other hand , if you go to a developing country and you can buy for 25 dollars a car , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend 20 dollars 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way the way to the other end of the city is worth 100 mice , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , fully whatever you &apos;re saving , but people don &apos;t think .
now , in big , you &apos;re very impatient .
see what happens when we skip <unk> .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so you say that our answer is to the terrorism , i mean that it &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no guns .
and so some people look at economists as a stupid people .
and variation and variation is one of these things that requires a certain intellectual activity , because you always see the variation with the theme that you have in mind .
&quot; so , in a way , in a way , in a way , and in fashion , the same rule of thinking is fantastic because of the first time , or not the first one that &apos;s been trying to figure out the old <unk> . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness -- my willingness to become a critical audience without suggesting that i am sure .
it &apos;s my intention to compete the poster <unk> , shouldn &apos;t you understand it .
so , all of the great and all of them are our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell .
if the room was <unk> , we could see that people are more negative more negative to <unk> men .
it &apos;s like i was <unk> to talk about what i &apos;ve done in these 20 years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food i became sick .
we don &apos;t need any trouble out there .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , that &apos;s the idea that we have all these children , it &apos;s a generation , and we have a whole generation of children who had to go through much psychological trauma or damage to africa .
throughout the book , more than an hour <unk> <unk> and <unk> animations .
what is the business ?
at least , it seemed to be , at least they could still stay true , and they &apos;re mostly true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
talk about it still .
when i came home from college , i worked in southern california <unk> , and you <unk> the spanish <unk> on the rooftops and things like that .
rsw : how does his schedule ?
the <unk> -- they <unk> me for mit , and they sent their technical <unk> to bilbao .
that reminds me of this .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you <unk> four months with three wishes , the ideas are always becoming more powerful and live .
and one thing that i wanted to mention was i wanted to mention that , but somehow , it was to thank all the companies that helped me to do it .
but in the meantime , these things are going on .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and things is remarkable , and this is what should be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible effort , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes and the sixth is going up here .
at this level , the 1,500 workers work .
50 percent of the computer in the world are going to recycling recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan <unk> , that less than five percent of the advertising had a picture as a subject .
and wish three is : <unk> . i was told myself , i should do myself , and i always wanted to have a little <unk> .
and it becomes increasingly important that we can figure out how we can win these materials from this incredibly complex <unk> .
the traditional ways to separate material , just doesn &apos;t work .
the traditional way to make a <unk> is happening to oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of that process , we have a mixed <unk> : many different types of <unk> and many different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and figure out whether they do the same <unk> as we .
here &apos;s mayday . it &apos;s going to be a token for food and you &apos;re happy , and you get your food .
you &apos;re waiting a little impatient to open up .
now , imagine that i give each one of you $ a thousand <unk> dollars in your hand -- so 10 <unk> hundred dollars a hundred dollars note .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- like , i throw a coin . i &apos;m going to lose a lot .
if we made the same scenarios that made identical scenarios , they would be the same things ?
the person on the left is a safe loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just human beings at the last level of development that make stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but when we think about buildings , the majority are just four stories tall .
we need to be less with concrete and steel , and we &apos;ve got to build higher . in the last time we &apos;ve been working on <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s just as much as we could have 900 cars on a year in a year .
<unk> curtains <unk> my window .
maybe , &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently , you &apos;re standing up there , to fight against the decline of law , the citizens of these networks together to help each other .
<unk> , the biggest and the oldest bank in russia , mostly in the property of the russian government , using <unk> , and citizens in the developing world of innovation .
we &apos;ve heard about ted talks about people who have <unk> their plants , and <unk> &apos;s working on the whole world of getting young people to make websites and make videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks , &quot; are all the kids ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
and he asked them to convey a message , and they all read in their own language a central language , which was a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do you want you to do the same thing . &quot;
a pastor , to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some <unk> .
there is about 180 messages in d.c. d.c.
it &apos;s already coming from parks and sculpture .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber fiber .
there are also a couple of constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i looked at my aunt &apos;s aunt when i was just five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend because we didn &apos;t have food , and we were about 400 .
as a child , as young as a child , words i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , shared with memory .
my lunch , my lunch , i &apos;m performing to a foundation that i founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give birth tools .
audience : aye .
the third chapter is a more complicated <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent of it .
so we &apos;re going to solve this problem by comparing the problem of death .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa <unk> knows whether or not . right ?
but , julie , you were ready for school . you were ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiled , in the sense , that was the right answer , and then they asked , &quot; believe that we were all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your larger ability to cooperate and adapt to adapt ?
i think this film shows the hardest glimpse of the modern times : &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we &apos;re not allowed to forget that it needs a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , good news !
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptics and <unk> of climate change in vision .
and we did a project for a few years ago , a big program , and a big program -- with many , many people -- a lot of experts were involved -- all the evidence -- all the evidence -- a big <unk> .
a group of asking them to spend it for themselves , and the other group is supposed to spend on other people .
when she went to the first building of the first building , all of a man , the <unk> and <unk> , and the aid needed , and the question is , they thought they were , and they helped ?
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called , called the hidden life , <unk> things .
since then , it &apos;s four decades now -- i &apos;ve been trained to train the best in this area , in the world , was young , young and old teaching , created a rich web of art , successes and accolades .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life .
i was dancing between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to my <unk> .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s how it was then .
and he put them together , they put them into something <unk> , and then he turned it into this piece of software that i think was originally going to developed his son , and he has this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , little <unk> , little knobs .
i want to suggest , i want to make a beautiful website . how could i say , you shouldn &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
now , the linked data data that they put together now . 32 hits each of which each protein is , and you can look at them .
and it &apos;s about linked data .
all this will lead that every year , two million children die less than the last year in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so that we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , feedback and giving it to make sure that people really want to get results ?
you just show one of the numbers that 5,000 -- is that number ?
my brothers started to draw me on drawing and painting .
and i &apos;ve been fascinated by this area .
how many of you have a cow walking across the street from bangalore to <unk> ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained as people are trained to perceive reality . and that &apos;s what matters .
and they said , &quot; all right .
can you not do anything with nothing , you know ? &quot;
this is a box from <unk> .
because if we can see somebody &apos;s going to see the footprint .
what percentage of these have made foreign <unk> ?
apparently he sat down for the last 20,000 years .
so the <unk> is actually beautifully suited to come here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;m going to talk to you today about the economists , i admit that most things are very <unk> .
this is where i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to do some technical .
think about toyota .
they can &apos;t be <unk> , so you accept it and find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza is taking place if you have hunger .
there are millions of different <unk> .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activity , they &apos;re out in baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet <unk> chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t <unk> it .
it is : &quot; how much percent of the day you think about this person ? &quot;
in about <unk> societies , people are leaving <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> .
and it was really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are <unk> than women ? &quot;
there &apos;s no time on that , and the women were so educated , so interesting .
she &apos;s 23 she took her for 13 .
i started to <unk> myself why you fall in love with one person in love .
they &apos;re going to pass long as long as the human race called &quot; the <unk> column . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves , if it could be , you know , the insulin resistance is the cause of weight and disease disorders -- at least where most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our views would be wrong ?
my great , henry ford , he really believed that this was the mission of ford motor company company , saving the lives of people to improve cars and cars .
and the good news is that we today are the big problems of cars and the environment -- not just for ford , but all of the industry .
i think you can imagine it .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to do when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that is capable of supporting these flexible future .
this is a minute <unk> .
i think now , i mean , my mother , i think , is kind of a <unk> .
the nurses have to enter data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what &apos;s out of that ?
too , it was great for us , because we won a lot of awards .
i got infected when i was 17 , when i was 17 , i met adults who believed my ideas that believed me , <unk> and many <unk> <unk> with me .
now it was just about the children . so we don &apos;t .
basically , we gave the children a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful pictures for them to make a really good purpose of the money that they give us to buy aids .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is , is that <unk> is cool .
in a way , in a nutshell , in the elegant or <unk> , we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of <unk> experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the <unk> of the country in the cities that took 200 years , the same process is happening in 20 years .
it changes changes , even though these were unknown .
so , for example , we &apos;d put the models under a artificial sky .
i think it &apos;s a reduction in height of 94 percent .
and what do we do in this growing world in these growing world , specifically in some places that i &apos;m talking about -- china for instance , which is going to build the next 10 years of 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the <unk> talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and our well-being ; it promotes no darkness .
unlike the initial office i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office offices , which is the <unk> .
behind you , you see the <unk> building , which is later on a icon of modern <unk> .
i think what you &apos;re seeing here is quite astonishing -- how much light goes into the sky and never reach the floor .
that &apos;s not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to <unk> anymore .
if our <unk> <unk> , like a couple of weeks ago , a war in a third of india called <unk> , about 200 <unk> , the <unk> .
and one day -- i know , i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was walking home from the office , i was maybe a <unk> , or it came to me in the sense : could i be a <unk> .
ag gupta : but what &apos;s going to use ? what was it used ?
to break , to break rocks , to break rocks .
this is the only place where she could express her creativity .
they don &apos;t want a second choice in standards and <unk> .
and that &apos;s what sheikh <unk> did have done .
i needed to my favorite ones .
mr. <unk> , who lives with a physical challenge , only 50 inches big .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> billion people .
or <unk> . it &apos;s just fun and people love to do it and to do fun things .
so we worked very , very hard , but we knew that it was not so hard to develop the technology as the acceptance of what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not done to park the cars ; it &apos;s wonderful <unk> to drive with them between cities and driving , but think about it , we have all the problems in terms of scale and speed .
so if we put this box here in a few years , we could have a solution for transport , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package , that &apos;s 60 kilograms ?
implicit or explicitly is suggesting that the people who die because they are involved in the drug trade , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re using the fact that they were either tortured or were professional <unk> or even both .
you &apos;re going to be <unk> as a string of psychopaths , the fear of psychopaths , fear and horror in cities , and it &apos;s true for most of the time .
mexico and the united states , now , is to be a real international organization associated with the production of production and global partnerships in the global distribution .
but also part of that , a month of <unk> magazine -- you live in the future , and we have a long <unk> .
and after it falls under a critical price , she tends to be successful , if you &apos;re successful , across a critical mass , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheaply , and look at the interesting effect , if you &apos;re cheaper , you lose the tokens , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> , they win , they win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open accessible &quot; is really , you know , the gift of the silicon valley of the world .
because some of the technologies that we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works in between and trying to take the best out of the two .
to second , it had to be very cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world has found access to a technology that lets him change his life .
and yet this is exactly the properties of men and women are honored by all generations .
they remember , while yellowstone was interrogated <unk> in his blog about the <unk> and <unk> it often . it was just possible because blogs are easy to use .
i love music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin play , and i said , i can .
i wrote this post , and i &apos;ve taken this out of einstein today .
and you can see this post .
these little things .
and maybe i &apos;ve got to <unk> because i &apos;m running out of that .
it has been <unk> <unk> , except from our generation .
so we need to use this process , immediately , to get a greater understanding of the oceans .
we looked at these fish , but first we had to learn how to keep them .
but it &apos;s just half as big as the greatest tuna that we &apos;ve ever described .
they come together . it could be like having sex . and there it is .
you can <unk> a lure -- it &apos;s <unk> like a seal -- and a white shark will go , a <unk> creature that comes up with our 16 foot on the 16 foot .
and then these animals give us one encore by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the records of my <unk> were exactly .
they said , &quot; apart from that we &apos;ve talked about , they belong to harm groups that wants to harm the u.s. ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
now , who &apos;s going to look at my <unk> , see that i was there , and white , i know that i was on the ninth of a <unk> <unk> at the time .
every few moments i &apos;m putting a <unk> on my life .
so when i started with the project , people said , &quot; why would you all want to say , and where you are ?
now it &apos;s all normal .
now , look at this <unk> of paris to see how incredibly fast the growth of growth is .
i looked at thousands of such <unk> , and trust , and efficiency are always driving elements .
how do we <unk> how trust &apos;s trust to face ?
i was kind of a mind in the system .
this is a day in a day of a day , and 80 percent of it gets a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality , which i showed you , i &apos;m going to go back to that again .
first with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second year , with the 50 u.s. states , with the same question : cutting the more unequal states on all these scales worse ?
with a devastating impact , which is the benefits of the population of the population .
and in our analysis of america , we find the same as opposed .
socially motivated judgment to take care of these judgments .
or for instance , why violence is more important in more unequal societies , because people are sensitive to become <unk> .
a year takes more than three million <unk> a new knee or a <unk> .
you remember , as a <unk> earlier , the <unk> showed you .
if you wear it under pants or a rock , it &apos;s very clear that it &apos;s very clear that they &apos;re wearing a prosthesis , and in societies where disability comes with a social stigma , people are very sensitive .
so thank you very much .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i actually bought the <unk> <unk> . there &apos;s a little piece of paper , which is , &quot; don &apos;t use these <unk> to <unk> juice .
so these are the results one up to the 20 , &quot; show google just as many as a result .
severe fear is <unk> .
but if you always would always be done in this condition , the work was never going to be done , &quot; oh , i have a new way of work , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve got a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
if the park was rusty , and he would drop apart , they would never be a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you shouldn &apos;t <unk> the results .
i &apos;m going to talk now about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that could look at me like an alternative education .
and the evening of this day , <unk> 70 children .
so i was able to take some of the <unk> to meet a cross-section , the part of the world .
what you &apos;re obviously seeing is , there &apos;s a child who uses the computer .
natural systems are all <unk> : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except the discussion of &quot; smart designers . &quot;
and it &apos;s around the <unk> of idealism in this whole <unk> .
i bought with a nice suit , and i was wearing shoes with <unk> and <unk> with this remarkable access to me .
but in 2002 , when my tour came to the end , i decided i wasn &apos;t going to go to the job in london .
i felt something was destroyed .
and i went through . i went through these piles .
and i went to kosovo and <unk> the government .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that comes out of the world , obviously , shows that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re actually concerned about these guys , not <unk> .
this is the 21st-century business of the 21st century , and in a certain sense , independent diplomat of these <unk> , this change that &apos;s all happening with us .
&quot; hey , could you bring me ? &quot;
because when we go back to the <unk> , they understand through these exercise that make a simple mistake , what you &apos;re not able to do , or you can remember why you love something .
we feel <unk> .
here we go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , it gave the geology show , &quot; the <unk> show , &quot; the <unk> <unk> , followed by <unk> , followed by three angels for charlie . &quot;
i can choose from the island .
and i &apos;m very excited to discuss this with you , i come in and say , &quot; can somebody explain the idea and why it &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
next , this <unk> stuff , the <unk> stuff .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , <unk> education is always more like the guy who &apos;s always saying , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have a lot of work in front of us , and if there &apos;s somebody involved in science , i ask you to compete with me .
we climb up the staircase and experience a state of consciousness .
so many books about war saying the same thing that there is nothing to work very much like war .
durkheim believed that everything was going to take us to think of shakespeare .
he said , &quot; <unk> and <unk> people are not going to be able to get rid of people without <unk> . &quot;

and as absolute connection , it works only in one direction .
and then the fact that we &apos;re brutally <unk> .
for instance , professor <unk> . he understood it .
so when it comes to , and if it &apos;s going to happen , who is going on ?
first , i want to make as <unk> as possible .

they &apos;ve been in the <unk> in the architecture .
and you see these <unk> <unk> that the protocell actually move away from light to the dark valley .
it &apos;s been managed to break me down , almost three decades of hospitals . i &apos;m most proud of that .
instead , i &apos;m a sophomore professor of law professor , psychology and psychiatry at usc , i have a lot of good friends , and i have a beloved husband and a beloved husband , who is here .
i quote from my writings : &quot; i had to rebel myself with my classmates and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , where we wanted to work on a homework assignment .

the american prisons are full of people who are hard disabled , and many of them are there , because they never got a proper therapy .

these are four billion hours that are going on in this country .
in short , there was a lot of water and not very many people .
and the montana brewers in montana , to reduce their water use , but they still use millions of water water to water .
it &apos;ll be paid to leave the water in the stream .
i don &apos;t like to use a problem with no problem with the solution , and so i want to highlight shows shows how mad <unk> &quot; and movies like &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and movies like &quot; <unk> , &quot; whose women are complex .
his name is matthieu .
i know there &apos;s other businesses with compassion , but google is the environment that i know because i &apos;m about 10 years now . so i &apos;m going to use google as a case .
so , it turns out , google is a business with compassion , because googlers find compassion &apos;s fun .
and there you go in the morning and have three colleagues that choose from <unk> skies to build a hospital in india .
there are three steps .
and i hope that compassion is also not for fun as a profit .
but one day was the perfect case . it was a <unk> that was sitting in front of her house .
i met with one of the <unk> , which was the training of <unk> and <unk> , which is the normal tendency to <unk> .
people often tell me , &quot; you know , that &apos;s wonderful , but it &apos;s highly <unk> .
in the same hand , sometimes you &apos;re experiencing , if you &apos;re sitting in the new york subway , you read and read , this <unk> and light .
different parts of the world have a <unk> for different things .
and at the same time , the glorious piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> , who made this beautiful <unk> and <unk> made of <unk> .
but the objects <unk> itself from full of water to this kind of water <unk> , it was really very broad <unk> .
even this chair you open and then put it in , so that you get <unk> , and this beautiful series of objects that will be seen as the design of <unk> from me .
so what &apos;s next to do with this ?
instead , they developed a very interesting approach about my training -- namely , that they would send me on a school that could barely afford to afford .
my last story , and i &apos;ve got to a little rush .
and he died when he was walking along to bring him to the hospital .
blogging is an opportunity to do that .
just jump the leap .
and we africans need to start to question our leaders to question .
my dad could not afford to afford it , and she &apos;s very smart .
and if you don &apos;t take you , then you &apos;re right .
the country for years was divided between politics and religion .
so our political problems .
<unk> and future leaders were shaped .
he worked in parol at a birth .
it &apos;s the heart of medical care .
i &apos;m going to sell this easy to every hospital .
well , when i got that , i was taking -- push the <unk> -- completely , you know ?
now , a couple of weeks will be a big girl .
and as you can see , it was the lifespan .
life expectancy rise to <unk>
that &apos;s the absolutely best technology for this area : <unk> .
let &apos;s start with the water .
but you have to share the world with the world .
the generation y seems <unk> .
100,000 people gathered up to a nonviolent march , and an idiot , or <unk> , you know , who &apos;s trapped by the cameras , and this one guy .
and it &apos;s also about humor . humor is such a powerful force that can turn the game , and it also played a very large role in poland .
now , the <unk> : how is it going on in the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk in live .
i said , &quot; if 500 can become a thousand or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more than that .
and i see them .
and everybody broke it up and said , &quot; yes ! &quot;
i know your father was never in <unk> , he was singing .
the other thing that you need to know about shame is , she &apos;s <unk> by gender .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
we want to be with them , and we &apos;re going to them .
and now , if we &apos;re standing up and <unk> ...
when an ant fell into the rice , i couldn &apos;t see it .
and that helped us create a very ethical and very powerful organization , and a system that supports them .
we have a simple camera camera in a <unk> <unk> and making a <unk> <unk> through a doctor for every patient .
so our revenue has been very much faster , which makes us a healthy value , and that &apos;s why we treat a lot of people free .
this is a difficult job .
for example , digital content is <unk> with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be an opportunity to make a cell phone ?
it was when they couldn &apos;t see me , as i was invisible .
and also , no one had ever heard a <unk> or seeing this sort of thing , and this sort of thing , the creation of new sense of vision , his knowledge , because now you have this concept in your head , and you know , now you have this concept in your head .
like bp , the hole is <unk> , at least <unk> , but not without an enormous cost of desire .
don &apos;t be ashamed of that .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth of this country that created our limbic system , a system that can &apos;t survive without <unk> growth and inadequate water .
the oil is not liquid .
now you may have more headlines like this .
great show . man , that was good !
bf : ... like the left .
dh : all right , please stand up here ...
rw : can i hold it ?
dh : power is just <unk> , say ?
dh : then we go .
dh : the french judge ...
dh : i &apos;ve got it -- -- -- to put the <unk> down there with me .
bf : by six to seven . dh : this is the world record . bf : really ? dh : for us . dh : for us .
it &apos;s less known as the two , because he had this idea to build mechanical <unk> and never built one .
but if yes , you would see something that &apos;s very much , very much .
this is from a paper that you &apos;re <unk> .
there are plans .
you know the problem , we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
second romeo and julia , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and diana , army and <unk> , that &apos;s love .
so 13 years after i sit in the wheelchair now , i was in a wheelchair in the wheelchair as a outside .
over generations , we have our children as well as a million other species living with us .
but it &apos;s not a normal movie .
but if i was a base , however , at the end of this screen screen , the resolution of <unk> &apos;s 800 <unk> x would need to be 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so he sequenced the genomes of his children .
it &apos;s because there &apos;s somebody in the audience who wants to stop eating .
imagine , in 2016 , the leading <unk> of the year in 2016 , not only for four years , but their personal genome .
and so i ask them all of them to affect and affect the genomic revolution that happens around them .
and we have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a special <unk> , which is within the solid part of the <unk> and the contours of the hip .
hopefully this technology will enable us to see more in the future of this survivors .
in the twig , what the sample is the sample of the gas , and <unk> it dies .
so what &apos;s exciting is , it can create the <unk> that &apos;s used to create possible <unk> , so we will soon capture some new particles .
the most famous charge is electric .
they tell us what changes are .
but it &apos;s like the unified theories .
many of the most beautiful structure in math .
the only way to get its spiritual health in the middle of all of the uncertainty , to experience happiness , is to preserve the balance and a perspective in life .
the pattern of dots that i showed you , actually , actually , actually , symmetries symmetries of this sort of thing , is moving , moving and on the <unk> space-time .
and we also heard about history from a bloodline of humankind through genetic <unk> .
we find a lot of , many , many examples of compassion , but for love , for love and real altruism .
most important , i believe , is to work with little groups of women to give them the opportunity to give you the picture of <unk> .
and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
take the <unk> for all the problems that we have on the planet , in terms of the environment , in terms of the environment , and it &apos;s a message of hope .
and <unk> pregnancies and similar things , what young people hear better from other adolescents than adults .
this change , these change . change is needed , if we care about the future .
working with the plastics , about the first eight years , a few of my pieces began to drop some pieces and break into smaller <unk> .
recycling . each one in about his book is about <unk> ecology with the idea of recycling .
so i &apos;m here , i &apos;m here , and unveil our youngest and the most successful trial that &apos;s in the middle of development .
the author of the book is juan , our <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s done by amazon .
at that time , we knew that this was a political thing .
at 15 years , i lost a child , a second when i was 16 .
i know what it means is suffering , and if you &apos;re a crime , a person should be <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
but what &apos;s not that ?
after a few decades , i was thinking , but eventually , i was here , the <unk> .
so that &apos;s what happens .
okay . the <unk> rate is used by thousands of people around the world .
or we could use one of these here .
mao tse <unk> described her to the european civil wars , and this is probably a <unk> description .
i mean , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is probably not going to be able to be able to be <unk> .
they &apos;re starting to see the <unk> of a football world .
but this is not anymore .
the <unk> of nations , well , we always had .
but now one last thing .
but if you &apos;re today , you ask the question , what the optimal formula for a long life is , he could not tell you .
it reminds me of my college time .
and research shows that these years are largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , disease and diabetes .
they have what we want .
we &apos;re at half .
and for a while for a while , we looked at the <unk> <unk> , where there &apos;s actually a high proportion to <unk> .
instead , they talk about the next trip into the nature , <unk> recipes , and yes , they pray .
it &apos;s actually done it on 9 <unk> .
they tend to feed <unk> .
for example , the little example i hold here in the hand , we &apos;re using a <unk> <unk> that responds to my skin by making this little light bulb .
so often amateurs , no experts , the inventors and <unk> of things like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
at the time , computers were very big , the only scientists were interested in , and no one ever dreamed of it to home one of them .
you just have your own eyes to come around .
i mean that it was already seen .
so we &apos;ve got the driver &apos;s driver to look at the driver .
and i said , i can &apos;t bring them , but i can put them in zero gs .
we had four <unk> and two nurses in the airplane .
and actually , you can now show some pictures , because i don &apos;t want to see the screen .
no life , from the smallest life to all of us , if you can &apos;t make these little <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> . i went regularly .
i didn &apos;t change . my iq was not down .
i was a writer .
so basically , no one would be willing to accept if your child doesn &apos;t survive .
and then we decided why not the religion use , because in philippines , the catholic church are quite strong , and <unk> are buddhist .
so we ran our first <unk> in 1975 , and the women they were organized , &quot; we want to borrow , &quot; we want to borrow to women &apos;s family planning .
you can call the coca-cola approach , if you like , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
and then aids goes in all schools started in university .
and then here &apos;s where the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t go without home . &quot;
these are things that are presented by business .
can you imagine , you can get condoms , you can get condoms ?
he can &apos;t be scary or scary .
so i &apos;m going to make a photograph .
you can simulate this behavior in the browser , what romo is now doing here .
i want to tell you about my four minutes of <unk> .
people like everyone here in this room .
she went , elegant , like a giraffe in the african savannah , the flag on her shoulder , and i left behind -- -- on the <unk> , the flag was <unk> , so my head under the damn thing disappeared .
i &apos;ve worked my whole life with women and women .
jenny is clear that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth .
she gets the women to plant new trees and <unk> , drop in a drop , drop in .
women and children , especially the poor , stand down at the bottom .
if you sell to early , you get the profit , but if you &apos;re waiting for a long time , all you &apos;re waiting for all , you fall down , fall off the class .
you can see the spikes clearly .
so the challenge for the <unk> player is , whether he thinks the other is fair , or giving them a little commandments , so he thinks that one one was one or two dollars .
now i &apos;m going to ask you a couple of relatives .
we can try . maybe we will .
so what do we learn today ?
about 10 calories , about 10 calories to eat food that we consume in the west .
how did a <unk> ?
and in the middle east in the east , in <unk> , they &apos;re breeding for sale . this is why it &apos;s <unk> .
and at that point , our relationship is completely changing both to the food and the cities .
the word jihad was used by thomas moore .
<unk> piles of <unk> .
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat .
she &apos;s the source of all morality , this <unk> act of <unk> , to put himself on the next one .
and i see that this is a <unk> intelligence , not just a <unk> feeling .
in the present phase , we have a <unk> -- and a half <unk> &#91; unclear &#93; half a million parts , quite complex , new and exciting technologies from steel , concrete , glass .
so the next project is asking this question and look at the nature of nature or the passive .
basically , you have a chain of elements .
when i was in <unk> , wisconsin , i thought i was a public talk about a group of students .
often , we &apos;re looking for <unk> of respiratory disorders like flu .
there are <unk> everywhere around us , and it &apos;s just waiting to be discovered .
could we turn the light off , so we could see it ?
so we are chemical <unk> that are different , and our kind of chemical <unk> has tattoos .
but i have to confess -- and i &apos;m sorry , richard -- that i &apos;ve never liked biological <unk> , and i think we &apos;ve had a few of a few hundred million years .
everybody &apos;s talking about things about what is a reduction in <unk> to <unk> any cost .
he realized that it &apos;s possible to <unk> different laws that enable the economy to make small profits , to make another customer .
both of these are dark in the comparison of puerto rico , which is half so many people than haiti , or the dominican republic .
one of these zones next to hong kong is in shenzhen .
people can come to live under the charter , but nobody is forced to .
a lot of those who understood the idea of <unk> , that people can share with rules .
how would we write such a <unk> ?
and you thought , in genomics , a little more than 10 years ago , you &apos;ve got to finish up until the end of this year , between three and five genomes , they &apos;re already hundreds of .
if there &apos;s lots of chlorophyll , they &apos;re very much green light .
the number of the common genes is a little bit when we ignored a <unk> parasite ; it &apos;s even bigger if we were focused on certain genes of genes , on about <unk> .
it adds its genome to a dose of radiation , through those of the chromosomes in little bits , within 12 to 24 hours .
so let me end up with ethical and political studies .
of course , it &apos;s worth waiting if you like <unk> .
we call them &quot; <unk> . &quot; you focus on what &apos;s going on .
and it affects me . i grew up as chairman of a <unk> family in the south bronx in the south bronx , everyone lived in the past and in the present .
let &apos;s take medicine medicine .
here is a beautiful image of the <unk> , the largest <unk> of our milky way galaxy .
it &apos;s cold , <unk> and <unk> , maybe it &apos;s <unk> , and maybe they &apos;re standing at the bank of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i can &apos;t tell you how that was the first images to see the beginning of the spacecraft from the spacecraft , and this was what we saw .
so here we &apos;re seeing a film of titan <unk> that shows these dunes , and these dunes are 100 feet high , and they have a total <unk> , and then <unk> and miles .
now , the earth is still the only planet , where we know that it &apos;s full of life .
they had lost 40 percent of their land , and they would have been that they had no free access to the rest of the bank .
<unk> : this is a <unk> <unk> .
so we organized a demo .
it took me four days .
and the rest of the brain is made of neurons .
and in fact , you can actually find cells cells into the hippocampus of the hippocampus , which is the exact same way in the <unk> or edges in a certain distance , or the mouse , if you study the environment .
and this would be represented by the fire of <unk> .
he was not the only man who suffered from one america without <unk> , and he was not the only great guy of his time .
and why should anyone care about this ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thoughts and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s look at it .
and if you talk about what they believe , they &apos;re going to attract the people who believe what they believe .
the reason for that people bought an iphone in the first six hours , for six hours in the snake , was their worldview , and her will will be the first one . they were the first ones .
people don &apos;t buy what they do , they buy why they do it . and what they &apos;re doing is just proof of what they believe .
and , by the way , he thought , &quot; i didn &apos;t have a dream called &quot; i have a plan . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget like cartoons in <unk> across the screens .
when this was the office in <unk> in washington , d.c. , the <unk> hospital <unk> , they were <unk> .
and we decided to use recipes to this purpose .
what if we had an waiting room in which you &apos;re not just <unk> when you &apos;re sick , but you &apos;re going to get sick , you &apos;re going to become healthy .
and they leave that with the belief , the capacity , and the efficiency , our most basic hopes in public health care .
i think that the last thing that happens when we grade our health care , it doesn &apos;t be the sick of the sick being measured , but the diseases that were being treated .
this is a real danger nowadays , which is a real danger of the world , but this is in the indian ocean .
and we caught it with this <unk> . there were six tons of cocaine .
eighty-five percent of you cannot read , if you enter the afghan <unk> .
multiply the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the world , how safety can be created entirely different .
do i really do .
remember , this is a fun thing to remember when the <unk> were . you know , count the points for al gore , count the points for the bush .
the circle represent the countries .
some countries had already been statistics .
but we need to give the united states a whole piece of going to find the same health that we have today on the philippines .
that changes gradually .
this looks like a happy story .
what you &apos;re doing here -- at which altitude they live -- it captures their daily .
it &apos;s about food .
it &apos;s this stupid concept about developing the developing world that we have , argentina and we created a <unk> of 50 years ago , and i said that this was a bad evolved .
governance . a working government -- this led to california from the <unk> of <unk> .
and i showed the approach to how seemingly impossible possible .
and the enemy is quite weak .
we &apos;re -- despite <unk> -- with ease in afghanistan .
&quot; but it &apos;s not an ideal world . &quot; &quot; and your government doesn &apos;t give us a step closer . &quot;
what would such a store look like ?
so what we need since the back is a <unk> <unk> .
do you want a better system ?
and the doctor told him , he shouldn &apos;t move .
&quot; who told us to become the end of the world . &quot;
