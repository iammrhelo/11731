you know , one of the great <unk> trips in the trips and a joys of research research is , in conjunction with the people who can remember the old days , which are still in the wind , and they &apos;re still in the <unk> samples of the <unk> stones .
simply knowing that <unk> still is beyond the milky way , or the importance of the <unk> , nor the meaning of the <unk> , nor the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , meaning the <unk> revelation of the <unk> , but it &apos;s not a <unk> , and a <unk> of the reality of the <unk> .
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to be <unk> by the death of death and so we wouldn &apos;t be surprised to the death , and we &apos;re going to be able to dance and to make art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> of dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> in the woods of finland , or the <unk> in the woods , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or the <unk> in the middle of the sahara , or the <unk> in the middle of the desert , and the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
all of these people are teaching us that there are other modes of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways to the orientation on the earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , one of the only thing that you can do with hope .
together , the <unk> cultures of the world a network of <unk> and <unk> lives , which is the earth &apos;s system and the world &apos;s important thing to do as much as the biological <unk> , which you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and dreams , <unk> ideas , inspiration , and <unk> , that &apos;s what &apos;s been created by the human imagination since the beginning of the beginnings of the beginnings .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humankind .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re capable of <unk> species .
and just like the biosphere that was gestated in a lot of the <unk> , this was just a greater speed .
no one is a biologist would say that 50 percent or more of all species are dying , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of the biological diversity -- is almost impossible to be <unk> in the area of cultural diversity .
and the key is for the <unk> of that languages .
as each of you were born in this room , we talked 6,000 languages on the earth .
now , one is a language of <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture is going to have access to the physical culture of the world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a turning point , a <unk> , a <unk> .
and from those 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re in monterey , right , that half are not going to be <unk> into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not going to have a lot of us to do . that &apos;s when nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely as an silence being to be <unk> one of the last of your people who speak to the last of your people who are talking to you , or to expect kids to expect to expect ?
and yet , this horrible destiny of actually someone does someone on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly man , is an elderly man , and she takes the last <unk> of an old language with himself .
and i know some of you , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; if the world is not a better place , if we all just speak one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a <unk> . &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would suddenly see what it would be if you could not talk to your own language .
so i want to take you a bit of a trip through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> of the <unk> to try to understand them , to make them understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who &apos;s in the way that i think , &quot; different ways of his being , &quot; really different ways of his own . &quot;
take example , take this kid in the northwest of the amazon in the amazon , the people of the <unk> , believe that they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> of the east , <unk> <unk> of saint <unk> .
this is a people who &apos;s not susceptible to the colors blue and green , because the forest is the forest that &apos;s dependent on the forest that people depend on , <unk> .
they have an <unk> language and a <unk> called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry somebody who talks to another language .
all of this time in the <unk> past time , the way that <unk> <unk> is to be talked about these big houses , which is six or seven languages , but they &apos;re never going to hear somebody who learn language .
they just listen to speak and then speak .
or one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was contacted in the year &apos; 50s .
in 1957 , five <unk> of contact can make a <unk> mistake .
they took a <unk> photograph of the air , what we would do as friendly as a friendly symbol , and they forgot that these people were never seen a little <unk> of the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face , or to see the character , they didn &apos;t find anything like this , and killing the five <unk> of the devil , and killing the five <unk> of the car .
but the <unk> killing not just the <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we monitored eight generations back to , and we found two instances of a natural death and when we were to do with a <unk> , they gave them that one of the people that died as old , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , she had a clear invasion of forest , which was amazing .
their <unk> could smell the urine of the animal at 40 steps , and determine what shapes of this was the animal .
in the early 1930s , i got a really amazing job of my professor when my professor asked me to go to the <unk> and the secret communities that were creating , and the poison of the <unk> , the <unk> of the strength of the strength of the strength of the strength and the poison that was used to make it .
so to give a sense of that <unk> to me , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the <unk> knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of reasoning .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i was going to be able to tell you , the great world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , <unk> , <unk> , whatever .
a continent will always leave out because the guess was that there &apos;s no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , and of course , there was a little <unk> of this very profound religious thoughts , which is the tragic <unk> in the tragic diaspora in the <unk> .
but what makes interesting interesting is that this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living group of the people .
ghosts can be <unk> by the large water , respond to the rhythm of dance to not <unk> the soul of living in the living of the living , so that the <unk> is going to be a <unk> .
<unk> say the <unk> , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; god goes into the church and you &apos;re talking about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with this , you &apos;re going to be picked up by the spirit , how can you get damage to the head ?
see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal , <unk> coal , an amazing stunning of the ability to influence the body of the mind of the mind that is being placed in a state of extreme arousal .
well , from all the people i met was the <unk> of the sierra nevada , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , who &apos;s most remarkable .
so hannah &apos;s ancient <unk> civilization that &apos;s <unk> the <unk> of columbia , and in a consequence of the egyptians , this people &apos;s got to go back into a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that had never conquered the <unk> .
to the day day , they become a ritual priesthood , but the training is very extraordinary to priesthood .
the young <unk> are separated at the age of three and four years from their families and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at 18 years , in <unk> , two periods of years , to <unk> , and two periods of nine years , he was elected to the <unk> mother of the time they were in the womb .
and while this whole time , they &apos;re culturally culturally engaged in their society , values that are the claim that their prayers are , they only have their prayers , only their prayers , or we could say that the environmental -- balance .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , she &apos;ll take a day and a half of the time in her life , at the age of 18 , you see a <unk> , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is , <unk> <unk> , and the priests stands back to the <unk> of the astonishing landscape , and he &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you gotta protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers to be responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this is very important to be very important .
whenever we think of the world and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> and the old <unk> of the very young , and the old <unk> of the very <unk> , which is a <unk> thought , or to say , these people are connected to nature , than we &apos;re connected .
so , they &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re not going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of space for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but they still shaped through time and ritual a mystery of being shaped to be being shaped at the idea , but it &apos;s not being close to the idea that the earth is going to exist .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid &apos;s a kid out of the andean , that &apos;s where the mountain is a <unk> , that the mountain is a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to determine a different relationship with this resource or a different relationship with this resource or a little <unk> of the time that &apos;s grown up in the belief that a tiny child is a bunch of stones .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a <unk> or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor that &apos;s the relationship between the individual and nature .
i was growing in the forests of <unk> columbia and believed that these forests are the forest that are there to be <unk> .
and that made me do a different person as my friends who believe that these forest forest is the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> ghosts , who are ghosts , the <unk> of the world , ghosts that they would participate in their respective communities .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . so , for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april of the amazon in the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you heard , the most powerful <unk> of the repertoire of the <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting is that fascinating is not only the potential potential of this <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , and on the one hand , there &apos;s a blue <unk> of the family <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
these plant contains some very powerful <unk> of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very much .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , how they &apos;ve <unk> this stuff , this substance that they &apos;re creating from various species , including <unk> .
this powder is a <unk> of a <unk> shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not really distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i actually got to my professor , richard evan <unk> , the guy who had the <unk> <unk> of the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said that you could not be <unk> , and i said that you could not be able to be able to experience this <unk> as a <unk> .
but the thing about the <unk> is that they can &apos;t be drowned , because it &apos;s <unk> , of course , because it &apos;s called <unk> &apos;s <unk> , <unk> .
you can only be <unk> with some other chemicals that are called the mao <unk> .
now the fascinating is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> are the <unk> of the species , <unk> of the way that &apos;s required to <unk> the <unk> . so , they &apos;re asking themselves .
how can these people from a <unk> species of <unk> plants that are not related to the plants that create a kind of <unk> version of plants that create a kind of <unk> version , so that &apos;s the whole larger than the sum of the parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which it turns out to be meaningless .
but ask the indian plague of them , they ask , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 varieties of <unk> , which is they &apos;re all in a wide distance in the forest that appear to see the eyes as a species .
and then you ask them , as you &apos;ve got to justify her <unk> and you say , &quot; i thought you understand something from plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that one of the 17 variants you take and take you to go and sing in one of a different <unk> .
now , this is not a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting a <unk> .
now , the problem is that even the people who have the sympathy for the difficult position of native americans , they &apos;re the <unk> and <unk> , but they somehow kind of limited to the past world , which is the real world , which is , at the world , the world , the world , the world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the twentieth century , in 300 years , or technical innovations , but rather than an era where we &apos;ve been present and to predict the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either compromise or passively .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> stopped not less to the sioux , as they <unk> and the following tasks , as the americans stopped america , when they first stopped the horse and <unk> tasks .
not change , and technology is the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you get around the world , you &apos;re going to discover these cultures are not the doom of the doom , and these are dynamic living peoples in the horizon , and that &apos;s <unk> living in the horizon , and then <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the forest , a <unk> of <unk> , by the <unk> of the <unk> .
or if we go into the hills of tibet , where i work <unk> , you will see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> , extinction extinction of people &apos;s general , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people , not just not <unk> , but generally , <unk> and <unk> as a part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering from the suffering , if you have not experienced it at the level of level .
i was a young colleague of <unk> 6,000 miles from <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> and only when i saw the <unk> of the statistics that you hear . 6,000 <unk> <unk> that were transformed into rubble and ash .
the father of this young boy was identified as followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion instantly .
his uncle fled to their holiness , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- for the crime of the crime .
he was at the age of two years in prison , in the age of two , she was to hide under her <unk> because she could not live .
the nurse , who was these brave <unk> , was brought into a <unk> .
one day , she stepped down on a <unk> <unk> and for those <unk> to the <unk> , she had to be a heavy <unk> .
suffering is <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really want to be a choice . we want to do in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , who said , before she died , that it &apos;s the greatest fear that we &apos;re in a thread , <unk> , <unk> details , we just see all the bandwidth of human imagination to see how we would have to see the entire range of human imagination .
and it &apos;s a humbling to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and we got to the cult of the cult of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , specialization , specialization , and surplus -- found , only 10,000 years ago .
the modern world world as we know it &apos;s almost 300 years old .
well , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the ensuing millennia .
if we <unk> these <unk> , the meaning of the human being asked to be , you know , with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be the possibility of what we are : people with deep consciousness that are aware of the importance of the importance of the importance , that all people and gardens are to be able to overcome a space .
here &apos;s a photograph i took across the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well very well with the inuit in the world , and during the <unk> years of our sovereignty in the aftermath of our regime , they were forced to move to settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s the old guy refused .
the family was the <unk> , and he took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you need to know that the inuit are not afraid of the cold , they used to use them .
the <unk> of their <unk> was originally made of fish that was made in <unk> .
the grandfather &apos;s a grandfather wasn &apos;t before the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out there , he got his pants down from <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and when the feces were closed , he formed her in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> <unk> on the side of the <unk> and it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a contractor , took the skeleton of the dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> another dog on the knee of the belt belt .
so you can do anything out of anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all native native to the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april of the inuit in 1999 , in 1999 , the bigger one is larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home of living and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> area . they control all the <unk> .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , the <unk> , can be able to reach and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to these distant goals of the earth , to see that they &apos;re not even away .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that &apos;s going to be <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids are , like the dreams of our own children &apos;s geography .
what we ended up with national geographic is that we think politicians will never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we think that storytelling can change the world , so we probably have the best institution for storytelling to the world .
so , potentially , the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
our papers are <unk> by millions .
and we companies to make a series of trips into the <unk> , where we take our audience to places of such cultural adventures , that they &apos;re <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and hopefully they will be a <unk> of the <unk> of anthropology : that this world has made it in different ways to make a <unk> <unk> world .
thank you .
what i first was , as quickly as possible , is to show you the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;re going to have to have , just to have a <unk> of a year ago , and that &apos;s a environment where you can overcome locally , or you can get locally to the enormous amount of visual data .
we see many , many of the <unk> of digital photographs here that you see in <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , in a way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these are the ones that are the pictures .
most of you are digital photographs a camera , but this is an example of a scan from the <unk> and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter because the only thing that can be the power of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen , and it &apos;s also a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a text and not to be a picture , we can do something like that , that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium &apos;s size of a kind of scales .
and we also have something to do this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false ad with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal ad , and we added additional content to add up .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them .
or other models , or even technical , technical .
and this is really , really , these ideas , these limitations for the available room , to let &apos;s reverse the screen on the screen .
we hope that no longer is no longer means , no longer , no need to be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the most important applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time except to say that we &apos;re going to be contributing to this area .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
<unk> at the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get another different .
now , this is live in the internet , and you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies together .
one is <unk> and the other is a very good research research on <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s from noah <unk> , and at the <unk> university of steve <unk> , the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done , a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that when we create these kinds of views , where we can penetrate these kinds of <unk> , and this experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation is the images here in the act of meaning .
the <unk> have been presented with these images that they were <unk> in the real room that &apos;s all the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> in the canadian <unk> , and you see these things are <unk> slides , and these things were all together in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;m time to show you other environments .
there are what you &apos;re much more <unk> .
i would like to go straight through the <unk> data data from a early prototype of <unk> that &apos;s been working on the summer of the day to show you that what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is not necessarily obvious , when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to make ourselves worry about the lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral , the chair that &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr , and they &apos;re just notre notre dame , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in <unk> and on the <unk> , and each of these orange <unk> is represented by this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they all are in the place in relation to each other in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception guy here .
and i suspect you can see that these many different types of cameras are : all this is , by the <unk> of the <unk> , a very large number of them that were <unk> to professional <unk> , a very large number of them that were all in these environments .
and if you can , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
many of you are <unk> by faces and so on .
there are a bunch of photographs here -- here &apos;s what they &apos;re .
this is actually a poster by notre dame dame right , which was right .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now being collected by all the collected -- it &apos;s a bit of the collective of the whole of the collective of the collective of it , like , and everything is going to connect .
all these pictures are connected to each other and it &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
so , consider this as the sequel of the work of the work of stephen <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to grow through the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s going to use it to the users with the application of the use .
their own pictures are very keen to have a different person who has a different person .
when someone did the effort , and all of these sacred notation , and you know who you &apos;re all and <unk> who are all , then my photo &apos;s <unk> , and i can use them to take it as a starting to take on this space , and i can use them as a starting to take on this space , and so they &apos;re using the photos of other people &apos;s experience of other people .
and of course , the <unk> , all of the things are the very powerful virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through <unk> or satellite and so on collective memory .
thank you .
i understand them right ? and so it enabled the software that &apos;s a certain point , within the next year , all the pictures that are using in the world together in the <unk> , basically ?
yeah . it &apos;s not different than you discover .
if you want to make it , you &apos;re making <unk> between the images .
and she &apos;s doing this because of the nature in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the <unk> information that have many of these pictures .
like you do a design card for pictures , where they enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information that &apos;s picture .
but what if the image is , if the image you &apos;re connected to all your images ?
then the volume of the <unk> is <unk> and the amount that makes it really , really , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thanks congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , like i hope , in order to be in unison , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections that they didn &apos;t have .
i want to start with what i call &quot; to call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies .
the official <unk> works like our goal is to maximize the <unk> of our citizens , is particularly through the <unk> of the liberty of the one .
the reason for this is that freedom of itself is good , valuable , meaningful , a <unk> of the human being .
if people have freedom , each of us is to do the things that are going to maximize our good to do with no one , and nobody has to choose to decide .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices have more choices they have , and the more freedom they have , the more freedom they have , they have more common .
this is , i think , so deep in our water , that it &apos;s not going to be able to question it in the sense of meaning .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we enabled modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about <unk> .
there are <unk> <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy a large number of <unk> <unk> , in the unlikely case , not the <unk> in the store for them .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store around a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in this one electronics store , there &apos;s a little <unk> of <unk> plants .
we can put millions of different kinds of <unk> plants out of the components that are offered into this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other domains , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there could be a boy , if he was , as long as he was , as long as he was at mama bell .
you &apos;ve rented your phone . you &apos;ve got it bought .
so a consequence of that was that the phone never broke was .
these days are over .
so we almost have an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phone cell phones .
my favorite is the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be pretty soon .
and what it does is it &apos;s bringing people to walk into the business and ask them to ask that question .
now you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone , not too much .
in other aspects of life , which is much more nuanced than the buy of objects , the same explosion of being able to do the same explosion .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could make a better or we could make b .
a lot of these benefits and risks .
b has got these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what am i doing ? &quot;
the doctor says a <unk> and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doc , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , in reality , the burden of the burden of choices -- the doctor &apos;s <unk> -- to someone who is not knowing and most of the time , and not the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , that when you think about it , all right , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do you make us do that if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you wait to call the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s doctor and to ask a change to the prescription .
something as a <unk> , as our identity is supposed to be a question of the choices .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity , we invent it .
and we &apos;re creating as much as we want to live .
so that means every day you wake up in the morning , you need to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in the <unk> that almost everybody had one and fast <unk> as they could , and then quickly children , they got the same kids as they could .
the only thing that was the only choice was , &quot; who don &apos;t care , and not what they did .
nowadays , it &apos;s just just to have .
i teach marvelous intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged in other things , you wonder , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ? &quot;
should i marry ? should i have no kids , or i just want to make kids ? &quot;
they &apos;re all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether it &apos;s all the tasks that i &apos;m going to get to do with you , and not get good grade at the class of my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to be important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to be as carl foresaw , which technology gives us to work every minute of every day of every time to work on the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s a corner from the corner of that i &apos;m not going to tell you the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make in work , again , and again , if we should work , or we should be working or not to work or should be working .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our phone cell phone to the one of the hip , and our blackberry , and our laptop may probably be the laptop to our own lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in the world , every minute in the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , we should be , &quot; should i think this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer is no , &quot; no , &quot; is it will be a very different experience of the <unk> of her child &apos;s child &apos;s personal character .
everywhere we look at big things and little things , tangible things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world is that we were living in the world .
so i want to say that there was some choice , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world is now , in the life of life .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> sense , is that he &apos;s <unk> instead .
so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of a study of investment in volunteers in volunteers .
one of the paper had access to me , access to <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million collaborators and about 2,000 jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old <unk> that was the employers to take two percent of the time .
they &apos;re offering 50 percent of the -- 10 percent less than if you would spend five percent of them as if they &apos;re going to be in charge of them ?
because there are 50 <unk> of <unk> who are to choose to decide to choose what you want to vote on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow morning , and tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , is never going to happen .
understand that it &apos;s not only that , people have to eat food , if you go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to have their own <unk> , which is hard to make decisions that they &apos;re on the big <unk> of their adversaries .
by not going to be part of the $ 5,000 u.s. dollars a year , they would have been happy to reproduce their contribution to breed .
paralysis is a consequence of a lot of options .
and i think it &apos;s a really useful world that looks like this .
you want to make the decision really right if it &apos;s all eternity for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want the wrong investment in the <unk> , or at all the wrong <unk> .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we get the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with a decision , we end up with a <unk> experience of choices , as if we had given the opportunity to choose between less choices .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is being driven by the big choice of a lot , if you buy a buy , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that &apos;s just imagine that they could have a different decision , and what happens is that they would have a different decision , and what happens is that they were having a good decision .
the more opportunities there is , the more simple is it &apos;s not a regret at all the time that &apos;s a <unk> for the choices you meet .
second , what economists call <unk> <unk> .
dan gilbert has a big point of view of how much the way we evaluate things about how much the way we evaluate it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to remember , it &apos;s just attractive to you , you know , attractive properties of alternative that you &apos;re willing to do that , you know , that &apos;s less miserable with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for himself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my neighborhood is gone .
i could go right outside my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought he &apos;s going to have the chance to have the possibility , day , day , day , a great parking lot .
<unk> is <unk> the happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are more choices , the more attractive properties of this selection will take consideration in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is some statements .
he &apos;s making a point of life in now and maybe to do things slowly .
but the more important thing he is doing is always , always , who you decide to do , they don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things may have lots of sexy qualities , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
thirdly , <unk> of expectations .
this is me met when i was sharing my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which it gave them a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of , and they bought them , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had gotten long enough , they &apos;ve got that , &quot; ok , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so to buy new jeans for many years of the <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want <unk> , light <unk> , right ?
do you want to throw buttons or <unk> ? stone ?
do you want to throw out on the holes ?
if you want to be a far , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my pine tree was down , and after i was , i was <unk> , &quot; i &apos;d like the way to the one that was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what was that , so i spent an hour of all these damn jeans , and he &apos;s got the business -- and i say the truth -- the best you &apos; best , i &apos;d ever had .
i had better . all these kinds of sentiments allowed me to do it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason i was bad for me was i was making all these available possibilities for what good people are doing for a good few .
i had very low expectations . i had no expectations than it was in a way .
as you walked in 100 species , you know , one of them should be perfect , right ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i had gotten to the point of what i was expected , and what i was expected to do was the expected .
so the add of opportunities in life that are increasing people &apos;s imperative that people are , people have to be how good options are going to be .
and this is all going to be less intelligent than the results that results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows that because if you knew it , you know all of you would not be here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that all better be better than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible to make people experience experience that were possible to make a pleasant surprise .
nowadays , in the world we live -- we &apos;re wealthy , and we &apos;re wealthy , and the best thing that you ever hope is to hope that you can hope to be the things that you ever expect .
they &apos;re never going to <unk> <unk> because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all got -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t do it better . i didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a <unk> of the <unk> of a bad sitting in , if it &apos;s only a bit of a way to buy , and you wonder why who is responsible , and you wonder why who is responsible . what would you have ?
if hundreds of different types of them are available , and they &apos;re buying a <unk> , and you &apos;re asking , why who is responsible ?
and it &apos;s also clear that the answer is : it &apos;s the answer .
they could have better do better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they are disappointed to be disappointed .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> of this explosion of depression , and also suicide is that people have experienced the <unk> because they have the <unk> , and then when they have to explain those experiences themselves , they think they were .
and so the <unk> is that we generally get better , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we &apos;re all holding for right now , completely fake . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s more selection than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices to make more choices than a bit of a selection .
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point of a long time , and we &apos;ve got our responsibilities to our responsibilities .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule question , the thing that &apos;s about to think about the idea , what all of these choices are in the developed societies , the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we heard about many of them whose problems are not the big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating is and it &apos;s steve , steve <unk> has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard car seats are not help to <unk> the car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they &apos;re actually hurting .
they &apos;re worried that we &apos;re bad at that .
if something is making a decision of what people make decisions that would move to their societies in which people would move to little 401 dignity , not just the lives of people improve , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a <unk> app .
<unk> is going to make it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices we &apos;re <unk> .
so finally , you &apos;re reading this cartoon , and , you know , a powerful person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know it &apos;s not possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point of the fish , the fish i know .
because the truth is that when you break the ransom , it &apos;s so possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that &apos;s all you get , you get your care .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with perfect certainty -- possibly in the fish , definitely for us , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is about an iranian <unk> , <unk> , and i suspect disaster disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier , about the human genome and what could mean , and over the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;re digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get the biology code into a new phase of biology by the new way we create new lives and build new lives .
we &apos;ve always got to ask ourselves .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think a lot of biologists have tried to understand and have the different levels of biologists .
we &apos;ve tried to try and simplify them up to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years ago , and we &apos;ve sequenced the <unk> of the <unk> world of biology in biology to the computer in the computer .
now , try to be able to ask ourselves , whether we could live life or could we create new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s the minimal genome of a species that can replicate in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do if we can achieve that with a few , a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that they &apos;re here .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , in comparison , trust me , and trust me , that &apos;s easy . but if we all look at these genes that we can take one of the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that we would have to take this to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to synthesize this chromosome , and we &apos;re allowed to figure out the individual components and make some of those fundamental questions .
and so we started to think of the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
so does it allow the chemistry to create large molecules that hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start to start the chromosome ?
so a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps at the <unk> <unk> of life .
and we &apos;re dealing with genetic code , and yet , still continued . and our last point would be , and our last point would be at an exponential curve .
we started this starting 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years before we did a minimally invasive review before we did the first experiments .
and it turned out to be very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so you can make a piece of play , the more <unk> .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and we could correct the mistakes .
so that was our first trial , starting with the digital data , the genome of the genome called the genome x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
so we made little bits , and we had a <unk> and had a dna molecule by about 5,000 letters .
so the exciting phase came as we took this piece of <unk> and put into a bacteria , and that bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were raised by the cells and they came back and kill e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were able to figure this model exactly .
they laughed more than her .
so we think that this is a situation in the software in the software , and actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome , and it &apos;s more than <unk> <unk> genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re going to <unk> it in cassette samples of the virus , which is how we could see the individual components of the <unk> cell .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to start using digital information , this digital information has to be accurate , this digital information is really going to be accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first was the <unk> in 1995 , the <unk> of a <unk> pair of base was .
we found out the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would never be possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of pieces of the 50 letters that are long for you to have to overlay smaller <unk> , to build smaller <unk> <unk> .
we have some unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have a <unk> cooker .
think about it : we have a <unk> code , a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 amino acids , and there is one single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases .
we &apos;ve only signed up at first .
some people were disappointed , they were not a poetry poetry .
we engineered the pieces of the pieces that we could easily easily capture and put enzymes that repair these , and back together .
and we started creating pieces of pieces of wood , starting with the five to <unk> letters , put these together together in order to make these together , to <unk> those together , to <unk> those together .
in every time we have these pieces in the surplus and we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the <unk> to the point of the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we &apos;re going to get these right large pieces -- with 100,000 pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular molecular biology , and so we &apos;re going to help us the other .
we knew by a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which is used biology to fix dna , which can combine to bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation to radiation .
you can see the top field that will be just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything again was put together as each other as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exist in space and move around , looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we engineered by using these processes -- actually , we just use <unk> design -- we have <unk> , and yeast , yeast adds into it automatically . yeast does this automatically automatically automatically .
this is not a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are shots over a decade of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve got to have done recently .
these are <unk> letters of <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever created by people .
it has a <unk> <unk> of over 300 million .
if we could print it with a <unk> 10 and no distances , it would comprise <unk> pages , just to <unk> these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s very easy . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s as much easier if you &apos;re in <unk> as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the <unk> out and give another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clones .
so , in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you can actually put a complete transplant chromosome from one cell to another one &apos;s cell can be able to activate those .
we &apos;re <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . so , in fact , these two times are two times as humans and mice . we gave it a few <unk> to destroying all the proteins , and we &apos;d give them a <unk> , and it was very amazing as we &apos;ve given it .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there &apos;s the end of the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring it to the process of something .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all species around the second chromosome or a third of <unk> , each time thousands of <unk> , each time , every time , thousands of them are in just a second species .
so people think evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> of the dna , actually , the actual dna .
the chromosome that has been in the cell ; it &apos;s not the chromosomes that we &apos;ve had .
it was <unk> in the cell and realized that other chromosome as foreign material , it &apos;s got to just a new cell to do with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> blue because genes we had put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and <unk> completely , in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins change the membranes , they were able to read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re going to fall .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , things quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the <unk> -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years .
and i was a argued that we could actually have a new form of the cambrian explosion of the cambrian explosion that might give up massive new <unk> of design on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re about six billion people in the next 40 years to <unk> .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet for each year in 1946 , in the last year , will be four years of it , four years .
we have trouble with food , with fresh water , medicine , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it will be a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion of hydrogen , and these are hundreds of millions of <unk> per day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from that material that goes into the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve now got out of our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and see it was the diversity that came out of it .
and we &apos;re in the first line of the <unk> line of biological reality and those of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of these rapid <unk> , to do what we call <unk> genetics .
so we have a big robot to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes .
if you think about these 20 million different genes or making these processes to optimize <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can transform with one small team in molecular science than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> of chemicals and so on .
this is a photograph of the actual <unk> of the we work with actually sit in and <unk> new species at the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it is . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re focusing on the <unk> generation .
they &apos;ve just seen corn corn to just a bad experiment .
we have <unk> <unk> and third generation that are relatively soon to get out of the much larger <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way in biology with a big impact on the cost of the cost of their availability or the limitation of their availability is , if we see co2 as the first time , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go to cells .
and we think we &apos;re the first to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a way .
but in the discovery of the world , we all have different kinds of different ways .
that &apos;s an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> .
it &apos;s co2 in methane around the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we can study whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could be put into <unk> , <unk> co2 to <unk> this process .
within a short time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> of the <unk> industry , right . if you could not do that at ted , what else ?
but the same thing we &apos;re working on is the same way that we &apos;re using the same new approaches to development .
you saw it this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a dollar year and having a half a dollar , if it &apos;s going to be the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s how to be changed by the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s what the future might be , can be accelerated , can be accelerate today , can be accelerate by synthetic bacteria , <unk> bacteria , and perhaps <unk> .
we &apos;re light years from it to improve people &apos;s people , and our goal is to survive long enough enough to do it . thank you very much .
so at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to you to explain how the machine works .
so , it &apos;s so far . and for all those who haven &apos;t been there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been done -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions which existed less than a <unk> second , at the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine under geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
i work . it &apos;s called &quot; atlas dam <unk> -- 44 meters in diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular image of the atlas of atlas in the construction of the nanoscale .
on 10 years , the machine ran on the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s a huge <unk> in the room room .
it &apos;s an image of the first <unk> that &apos;s all the way around the lhc , then to <unk> the lhc , then to <unk> a <unk> of particles to make a rainfall of particles .
in other words , when we saw this image on september , we knew that the machine works , what is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the largest <unk> , or this , as someone was to visited the google page and find the front page .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
and about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires here -- these golden wires here .
these wires <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine is running on <unk> .
well , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , no . these are little wires . &quot;
they can afford that because if you &apos;re very cold , they &apos;re going to call them off .
so , minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand the tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and it &apos;s a <unk> heating and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this was the result .
now , this is what &apos;s wrong with the fact that the magnet &apos;s blinking over 20 tons of gas and shifted to about 30 inches .
so we &apos;re going to be <unk> about 50 of the magnet .
and to remove them , what we did was , what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we will turn it up , and we &apos;re going to see the first data on june or to meet , and we &apos;re going to focus on our journey to figure out what the building blocks are .
well , of course , in a way , a kind of <unk> these accidents have been the value of science and <unk> at those boundaries , it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to do that , that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words with a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> , michael <unk> , michael <unk> , and he was <unk> michael <unk> , and the scientific imagination is , &quot; no , nothing is so dangerous for nature to be <unk> , and that &apos;s not a new worlds of the human mind . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books too , write my profession , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s my big , life , life and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change that &apos;s ever going .
but a recent thing is a little curious about my life and my career that has been initiated me to <unk> my relationship with this work .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a snake named <unk> , <unk> , love -- that , unlike all my previous books , were gone into the world , and a large <unk> , international <unk> was turned into the world .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m treated as i &apos;m treating the demise of the demise .
seriously -- the demise of <unk> !
for example , they come up with me , and say , &quot; fear , don &apos;t be going to be <unk> ?
don &apos;t worry about it that they &apos;re <unk> all of their lives and never created a book that anyone in the world ? never ?
okay , that &apos;s really what courage .
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i first told myself as a teenager , that i told myself that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of previous reaction .
people said : <unk> did not be afraid , never succeed ?
do you worry about the humiliation of a <unk> killing you ?
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re your craft life , and you never get something that comes out of a <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> -- your mouth filled with the bitter <unk> of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
and i always had .
and i was scared of a lot more things that would not get a lot of the one .
like algae -- and other things are <unk> things .
but , when it &apos;s about writing , i think i &apos;ve been thinking about it and question me : why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that should be expected to be expected to do the work that he &apos;s doing to do the work of the work he feels ?
and what &apos;s going to happen is to be with the creative enterprises , that they &apos;re making us insecure about the other &apos;s mental health -- in a way that &apos;s not going to do other professions ?
my father , for instance , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember no situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked , whether he could have been afraid of being chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how is it that ?
it &apos;s just not just , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been the <unk> of the centuries of <unk> people &apos;s not getting the <unk> of <unk> people .
we writer , but we seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative <unk> , to be mentally unstable , mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds from the twentieth century , the young and often , often by hand hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t really <unk> <unk> , seemed to be neglected by their own talent .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books have been killed a little bit more .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
but we don &apos;t even get a little bit of a time , because we &apos;re listening to somebody &apos;s kind of a thing because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of thing for so long time . somehow we &apos;ve <unk> the notion of the meaning and collectively of course , and that art is kind of <unk> and <unk> .
the question i want to ask is to be here today is : is this idea of all right ?
so you &apos;re probably feeling that ? because only one centimeter of time -- i feel like this idea , not even .
i think they &apos;re <unk> .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s taken into the next century .
i think better better if we &apos;re living our great creative endeavor .
and i definitely know that it was -- in my situation -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark path of reasoning -- particularly in the fact that i &apos;m just in my career right now .
that &apos;s -- you see , i &apos;m a young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i have a more 40 <unk> in my mind .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to be about writing is the world &apos;s being done by the world &apos;s success , and the best thing i got to do is , you know , success &apos;s success .
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s a <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of friends -- it &apos;s probably my biggest success i am behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can bring somebody to the morning at the morning , drinking dinner , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d better do this work i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while , for some time , i think i &apos;m struggling to write , i &apos;m struggling to write a kind of <unk> psychological .
somehow , i have to find a way to write a healthy distance in real life between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction will be on the <unk> .
while i &apos;ve looked for the last year for the study of models , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they could help , to help , as you can help with the emotional risks with the emotional risks that are connected with creativity .
this is a quest to greece , and the old rome .
i &apos;m going to follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece , rome and rome have no believed that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is from a distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown , unknown .
the greeks called the <unk> <unk> of creativity that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed that he would have a <unk> , who was going to be told him from a distance .
the roman idea had the same idea called the <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a very clever individual .
they believed that a genius was that kind of weird thing was that was believed that it was literally living in the walls of a <unk> life -- about as <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the performers in the work , <unk> <unk> and the outcome of work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s a distance , because the distance i talked about -- the psychological set of being protecting you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s <unk> was protected , like , for example , too much , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had a <unk> genius that helped you .
if your work isn &apos;t entirely your fault -- isn &apos;t it entirely ?
everybody knew your genius was a little paralyzed .
so people in the west are really a long time thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s take human individual to the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery and mystery -- and there &apos;s no room for the unicorn .
it &apos;s the beginning of the <unk> , and people started to believe that creativity is completely entirely by its individual individual individual individual individual individual .
for the first time in history , people hear these or an artist , and instead of those artist , he &apos;s a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of a naked person that he thinks he thinks he or she was like the <unk> , the <unk> and the essence of all of the divine , creative , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like somebody to request the sun .
the <unk> and <unk> whole of the ego , and it creates all these <unk> expectations .
i think that this is the <unk> of our artists that has been exterminated .
and , if that &apos;s true , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to have a age-old understanding of relationship between people and mystery to the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t make the <unk> out of 500 years of <unk> , not just <unk> in a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience , which is really <unk> scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> -- <unk> , people who are <unk> and apply to their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to say is why not ?
why not so that ?
because it makes sense as much sense of meaning , if it was about , the absolute <unk> of the creative process of explaining to explain the absolutely crazy <unk> of creativity .
a process that is -- how anyone knows it &apos;s ever trying to make something -- so in other words , in other words , in other words , is not going to be sensible .
in fact , sometimes he can feel really <unk> .
i had recently met an extraordinary american poet <unk> <unk> stone , who was now about 90 , but she was told her all the life that she was in the fields in the fields , and she said she was growing up in the <unk> , and she said she would feel like a poem on the landscapes of the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
the land on her land was <unk> .
she felt if it came , because it would be the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that they could only be one moment of a moment , and that was -- in her words -- <unk> running the devil , <unk> <unk> .
she ran like the devil for the house as she was tracked by this poem , and it was just so that they had to get quickly enough to make paper and capture a pencil , and it could capture it by her light , and could capture on the paper .
and other painting , she was not fast enough . they ran and ran and run the house , and she would get the poem , and she was <unk> , she said , she would move over the land , and she said , she said , <unk> , <unk> after another poet .
and then there was these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there was moments in which they were almost missed .
so she &apos;s running the house and you &apos;re looking for paper and the poem , and she &apos;s taking a pen , and she &apos;s taking a pen , and then she said -- was it as she was going to reach out of your hand and get it .
she caught the poem on his tail and he pulled it back to her body and took it on the paper .
and these excitement came in <unk> , and i was getting up to the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word , first .
when i heard that i heard that i was a <unk> -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
this is not my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i need to work on the same time i get to get up at the same time , and <unk> me , and really <unk> me , really awkward .
but even i have my <unk> in my <unk> sometimes .
and i guess that many of you have done that .
i have work or ideas that i &apos;ve been working on a source of me , i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how are we going to get to lose with a relationship with no understanding of our minds , but in fact , intellectual health ?
for me , the best living for me is the musician , and i was able to interview the musician , and i was teaching him for a few years ago .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of the time , tom &apos;s the embodiment of the artist , tom &apos;s <unk> , who was trying to master the <unk> of the <unk> of the world , and they &apos;re trying to deal with them .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he was a walking walking in a freeway in los angeles , and there was all that changed for him .
he was driving at high speed as he suddenly hear a little bit of a melody , which is a little bit of <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , but he &apos;s <unk> , but he &apos;s <unk> after it , but he &apos;s <unk> after it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to get these old <unk> <unk> in him , like , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be <unk> from this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting into panic , it was just stopped .
he ended up doing all of this , and doing something completely new .
he just looked up in the sky and said , sorry , <unk> , can you see me ?
<unk> : i think i could write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come on , come back to a <unk> moment when i care about you .
if not any , <unk> tonight somebody else .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as it ever as much as it ever .
but the process of the process of <unk> that surround him was , was <unk> when he was a genius , where he was not going to have trouble in trouble , and he realized he was a <unk> , <unk> thing he had to be .
it could be a <unk> , goofy , weird , weird , a conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> , that not quite tom .
and as i heard this story , it also has a little bit of the way i worked and it was a little saved me .
this idea was saved me as i was in the middle of the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell in one of these these regions of the <unk> that we &apos;re all in doing something , and it &apos;s not going to work . you start thinking that it &apos;s a disaster .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remember , like tom &apos;s in the free sky , and i was trying to .
so i got to the view of the manuscript and i spoke to my comments direction in a hot corner of the room .
i spoke loudly : you know , you know , you , you know , you know , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i think i &apos;m all going to invest in , invest . i don &apos;t have any more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to put up here and speed your percentage of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then , the hell , the hell .
i &apos;m going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you the <unk> that i was here today for my part of my jobs here .
because ... -- at the end , it &apos;s like following this , and centuries ago , in the deserts of centuries , people have gathered up to <unk> people with holy dances -- to the dawn for hours .
these are always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , it &apos;s very rare , very rare , and one of the actors were actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen you have a performance of a performance .
it was as if the time was <unk> , and the dancers through a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing different than he ever did it -- 1,000 nights before he had done , but all the time they had .
and suddenly , he was no longer in human history .
it was lit up on the inside , and it was light up and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
so when something happened then , people knew what was called , they called it .
they put hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting , historical <unk> of <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> flew in , the pronunciation changed the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you &apos;re still hearing at the <unk> and <unk> .
if an artist was impossible in spain , something has done something magic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> , <unk> , is a <unk> glance .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but the tricky part of the world is the next morning , when the dancers wakes up and realize that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god &apos;s god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knee , and maybe he will never get to the heights of that heights .
and maybe someone &apos;s going to be able to call god &apos;s name , if it &apos;s going to turn , but what &apos;s going to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
but maybe it &apos;s not all that full of <unk> , if you haven &apos;t believed in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of her was coming from them .
if you think you &apos;re just a loan -- you &apos;re a <unk> source of your life , of your life , of your life being passed on to someone else &apos;s being passed on to someone else .
if we start thinking , we change it , changes it .
so i started thinking , and i think i think of security in the last months , while i worked on the book that &apos;s going to seem soon -- as dangerous , frightening , frightening , <unk> success .
what i &apos;m going to tell myself is , i &apos;m going to get crazy , i &apos;m not afraid .
not <unk> .
do you just make your job .
be to the contribution , and whatever it is , as it may always be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the shiny divine genius , the <unk> of the moment is , decides to show a moment of wonder of wonders , then you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance , they dance their dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all this .
i believe in this , and i feel like that , we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you all this , just for you , just to be the mere human love and the <unk> for that .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate the arctic <unk> , which had nearly three million years of the size of the lower 48 states to be 40 percent .
but this isn &apos;t really <unk> enough that really , really , the seriousness of the ice shows it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic <unk> the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> , which is happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is labeled with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing up to the <unk> , this is the annual <unk> of ice , and it &apos;s a <unk> in the summer .
this is what &apos;s called <unk> , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which is <unk> from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen line for the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s big amounts of carbon dioxide in carbon dioxide , which is when it &apos;s <unk> , microbes from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of <unk> substances in the atmosphere , it could double that amount of times , if we cross those critical point .
already today , there are now <unk> in a couple of flat fields in alaska .
professor <unk> walter <unk> university in alaska is another one in another one shot in the <unk> lake last year .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it be <unk> .
and one reason is this huge <unk> greenland comes from north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are considerably higher than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the southwest greenland .
if you want to know , the sea level of sea level is going to be here in the sea , you &apos;re going to sea .
these rivers are very quickly .
on the other end of the planet , the antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers announced that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> , is particularly powerful in the melting .
this is the equivalent of 20 feet , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , see the new lakes , which were glaciers in a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world are getting half of their favorite from this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier &apos;s the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , most of the water is <unk> .
california was a 40 percent reduction in the sierra part of the sierra union .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as they &apos;ve read them , are serious .
this <unk> around the world leads to a dramatic decrease in fire .
and the polio eradication , in a really <unk> , and never unprecedented , and we have no more unprecedented degree .
so four years ago , many four years ago , in the last 30 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s like .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve created 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , the american continent western western <unk> and the indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a very <unk> decline in the oceans .
the largest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the absence of biggest problem .
the united states are one of the largest <unk> , combined with china .
and the suggestion was , many other <unk> .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here &apos;s the ones that were collected in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political debate in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a $ <unk> last year to promote clean charcoal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , at home , in a billion , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america &apos;s <unk> .
this was what christmas happened .
one of the ads of the <unk> was that this guy was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy , happy .
there &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it &apos;s going to help our economies .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> will clean a day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the leader of <unk> <unk> .
let me say one thing you &apos;re saying , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for the public policy has been initiated for two of the campaign .
this is one part of her .
in the <unk> , climate change is a serious threat to our business .
so , we put it on the supreme court , a major <unk> of spend a <unk> <unk> to bring the truth about charcoal .
the fact is coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also pretty well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s give it to that .
<unk> coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of them .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of coal is the <unk> of the global warming for global warming , the remarkable clean of the world that you see here changes .
look at it right , this is the world &apos;s , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge , and our economic security challenge and our national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free ourselves from that <unk> situation .
<unk> america : 100 percent of electricity , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america back to work back to work , to help us make it safer , global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest-growing ways , our dependence upon old , dirty fuels , the world that goes to reduce .
the future here is here . wind , sun , and a new energy system .
new investment , to make good jobs for <unk> .
<unk> america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african african : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to go close , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
so i want to start asking you to ask you , at the time of their childhood , when they played with <unk> .
while they realized how to turn the hands out and <unk> the <unk> , and move them to look at the <unk> and understand problems through understanding and change and change .
the spatial thinking is very closely connected to how we understand most of our surroundings .
as a scientist , inspired by the way a scientist engineer -- together with my interaction with real objects , and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , and my colleague , i was wonder , what if we could do the computer , which is , if we could do the computer , then , and you could reverse them and scanners them up as a <unk> .
and this question was so emotional that we decided to explore the answer and we developed <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a <unk> computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move to your hand , you can see each other , you can capture your motions and you have a screen and you &apos;re a screen .
much more important : are physically physically physically , and they &apos;re just how <unk> can move through the order of the hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> technology .
and when these tools are physical , and they &apos;re going to be able to detect a awareness of their movements , each other and the subtleties of our <unk> experiences with them , then we can start to explore and start with exploration .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and if i <unk> it into a direction , the video will play forward , and if i <unk> it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them up next to them , that &apos;s what you &apos;re interested in .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that they &apos;re getting a nervous nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their motions and slope .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply ordinary gestures on data to the <unk> , like the colors that does it with the fluidity .
in this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to incorporate color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to be blended .
if we overdo it , we can <unk> a little bit of <unk> .
there &apos;s also a couple of nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we give people the opportunity to see the possibility of fast and the results .
here &apos;s me -- this is a series i &apos;m using a simple <unk> set of exercise .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of blend of <unk> and <unk> .
and basically , you get each round of a <unk> randomly letter , and as you try to make words , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to a dictionary .
and after about 30 seconds , again , again , again , and you have a new <unk> and <unk> opportunity .
thank you .
these are a few kids who came to a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and take it a video of it , and i was a video shot .
they really loved it .
so an interesting fact is , in this kind of applications , you have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; you know , you know , what &apos;s to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people that testing it .
this is our youngest <unk> there on the bottom .
it turned out that he wanted to make the <unk> just .
so they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by using the <unk> of the table that shows this character .
here &apos;s the sun .
the sun is going to be .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
the orange is tractor .
good work ! yes !
by appreciating the <unk> and it &apos;s able to turn them together , he can interact the characters .
... his own story .
hi .
it &apos;s a story with open and , and he can decide how they evolved .
flying <unk> .
the last example of that i have now is to show it , is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve recently developed recently and in the <unk> as sound , the <unk> , bass and <unk> .
each has four different variations ; you can select which you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes into any sequence you can go into any kind of patterns .
and you put them in a way by having a <unk> <unk> .
there are effects that can transform live , like reverberant and filter .
you put it together with a certain note , and it &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
and then , more sobering effects like speed and volume , which you use to use the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s take .
we start to <unk> the <unk> into two <unk> and <unk> them in a row , and then expand a little more of the vote to add .
now i &apos;m putting a <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of the time .
and now i combine the filters with the <unk> , so i can control the effect of life .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by looking at the speed of one or another direction .
and now i combine the filter with the bass ; it &apos;s more expression .
i can make the sequence while they go into .
it doesn &apos;t have to plan it to do it in the front , but they can improvise or <unk> or <unk> .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> by the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , i &apos;m excited to develop new <unk> of creativity that fit better to how our brains work and work .
and today , i had time to show you some of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea i want to give you to you with the way that we &apos;re on the verge of this new generation of <unk> interacting with interacting with digital media , which is the information that is going to bring information in our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m excited to talk about them all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m here .
so , what should be <unk> ?
i have to take a little back , and it &apos;s just happening to be concerned with modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular molecular and i &apos;ve been working on a few years of the <unk> , and i started to know because i wanted to know more and more important , and i wanted to make it myself in the way that i learned in the way in terms of ways that i learned in the way in terms of the way in the way that i learned about in the way .
so that &apos;s my primary concern .
so , it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think that molecular molecular biology now is talking about biotechnology , biotechnology , everything you count about , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is now , now , is extremely important , and more important , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like this whole genetically engineered plants in the <unk> .
now , there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> that &apos;s trying to make the <unk> , so gas algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that are really going to be in the world &apos;s real life , which most people don &apos;t realize , for example , to wash 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically <unk> enzymes .
and the list can continue on endlessly endlessly .
and so what interests of this technology is i &apos;m just going to continue to <unk> .
so what &apos;s why ?
most of you know most people know that from the <unk> .
computers , and then it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s going to be like that the hackers , yes , the hackers break somewhere , and they &apos;re picking up and so on .
that &apos;s kind of a <unk> very sad , because it doesn &apos;t really think what it is , what it was actually starting to do the same , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> <unk> with <unk> and it &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , brilliant way to solve a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just an engineering problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a <unk> , so you can <unk> a question , so you can do it in a question , and how can you do it or how do you do it .
and it &apos;s been <unk> with software , but it &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that &apos;s going to do with all kinds of things that make all kinds of things .
and now , just in the way , in biology , and there &apos;s this metaphor , which is the <unk> of biology , is that biology is actually a <unk> of the biology , because it &apos;s a bit of the computer code , because it &apos;s not just the same thing , the real matter of it , and it &apos;s not just a <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it &apos;s also the way you can program and also , and that &apos;s what you find , and that &apos;s what i found , i find myself fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper with my work .
it &apos;s actually taken eight really shape eight really shape these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , and with a cooperation in india , and with a <unk> of india , which is now now members of or active people around the world .
this is an sort of artistic posture , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working with scientists and researchers with scientists to make these technologies and to make the creative and process , there &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
but it &apos;s always about having a <unk> access to find a kind of a bit of a kind of complex to do it .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more like a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to hit and talk online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical along and also a little bit of <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to ask , yes , <unk> questions .
and from these networks that have the whole popular agenda , has been developing a scene that i want to leave you for a brief time .
here &apos;s the image on the left , you see <unk> , this is a <unk> , so a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit <unk> institution , where anyone can be .
kids , old , all sorts of people go through it , just to imagine , they put a lab in the lab and look at what &apos;s going on when those <unk> are .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia , a group in indonesia , <unk> is the ones that are quite long .
more than these other networks .
so they &apos;re also concerned with biological materials and biological materials , and it also , in a pretty <unk> way , and combine it in a pretty <unk> way .
a group of <unk> that i met a little while ago , which is a <unk> , which is to give you more to what you want to do to the public , and they &apos;ve learned so so on <unk> little actions and what they &apos;ve done so on the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i have a lecture in copenhagen in the <unk> museum in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition in the <unk> museum .
and that &apos;s the most commonly &apos;s most commonly young people , but the only thing that is all the united states , is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do with it and just the same thing that you can do with the society and ask , so , what you do , what you want to do , what do you want to do with you , you know , what do you want to do with you ?
so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need some materials .
you need to have biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you normally understand is that kind of <unk> machines are , extremely costly , extremely distant , just <unk> , <unk> , married , academics with <unk> , and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , <unk> , that actually don &apos;t need to do that .
it &apos;s not necessary because every single <unk> has actually developed higher than most <unk> technology , and it &apos;s really like that .
and the real thing with this premise of this premise is , for example , brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , and then a <unk> <unk> , and then , yes , so <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be <unk> bacteria .
so everyone who &apos;s a soup is <unk> , which he has left too long , even for the time .
i was trying to turn that into my lab home , a little bit , and i would stop on ebay , and then i would have gotten on the <unk> of ebay , so it &apos;s like this <unk> , so that &apos;s the way of <unk> .
this is not a joke at all , but it &apos;s not a joke .
here in the bottom of the picture , you see the lab , in <unk> , is so much <unk> garage with all sorts of <unk> , a group in paris , a group in paris , which is what it &apos;s done in and pretty much interesting things , i &apos;ll also do a project .
and this is <unk> , which is also mentioned , <unk> , this is sort of a <unk> device in molecular biology .
and yeah , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s where you stop at home , so that &apos;s the way that you &apos;re at home to large larger organizations that are more larger than that , you know , more <unk> in <unk> form .
but always the way of the approach that it is just to be easy and to be accessible .
the first project that we did as international group is we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves as we were aware of ourselves as a real shot , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;ve now known the people that are always doing this forever and so on .
and then i was just from the <unk> website of the founders , and i said , we have to make a really meet , even right now , and then we have to make a real meeting , and then it &apos;s a real time to get a <unk> , <unk> 10 , and just to go on to the <unk> .
and then , as it was , i &apos;m going to be , yes , who are we , what are we going to do , what are we going to do , what are we going to share ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes defy , our foundation ?
and then we have a <unk> .
so that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just got so his wish , and that &apos;s what it moves , you know , would .
and there was , i think , a whole good code .
and then we don &apos;t plan that &apos;s not unreasonable , but that &apos;s , i think , well , i think it &apos;s pretty good , people are quite convinced , and people are quite convinced .
and we &apos;ve actually tried to <unk> that in the academic world , but there &apos;s no way that we &apos;re not going to have this .
so i think we &apos;re in the <unk> &apos;s <unk> in which we &apos;re more than the world &apos;s tallest world .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do so that ?
a project i made with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to make an optical case or optical <unk> .
so that &apos;s when you &apos;re focusing a beam of beam , on a room , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid , so that &apos;s trapped there , so that &apos;s trapped , so like such a <unk> , like such a <unk> principle .
this works , this is done in the academic <unk> of <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , we can actually have a webcam , the lens of <unk> , <unk> , then you have a microscope , <unk> <unk> .
this is the bottom .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> laser <unk> the laser and tries to focus on the camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of learning about it .
so another project that came from the french group out of paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do so much such as a <unk> , or something like that , so he &apos;s got <unk> , so he &apos;s got to be engaged in <unk> .
and he &apos;s got this helmet that built this helmet and the museum in the museum is that we &apos;ve walked in the museum .
so , there &apos;s the visitors going in the room , at the time , sit down to this chair , that helmet helmet .
then they were measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they &apos;re all in the room .
it was quite quite a <unk> project .
another thing from the u.s. , which is also to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to copy genes , to multiply genes , <unk> , fragments that you can actually make them visible .
so if i do this , the <unk> <unk> on the scene of the crime scene , then you go there , you know , you &apos;re going to turn these things , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this person , so .
and the machines that make this kind of thing that are pretty costly to buy the commercial <unk> , the way that they &apos;re going to go on with <unk> .
and that &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just a app of many , that can you do with it .
and they have two two <unk> <unk> and said , <unk> , that &apos;s more powerful , and then we have a cheaper source , so that this device is <unk> , and they &apos;re now <unk> to the <unk> , and are now the cheapest , and they &apos;re now the <unk> of these devices .
i think , like a little six dollars or something .
but it &apos;s still not yet , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s not a framework where it &apos;s clearly going to be clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i was starting to build was a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like a kind of <unk> , which is the <unk> , two centimeters or so .
you put <unk> on <unk> and the <unk> in these <unk> , and then i went to the <unk> and then i took that the light to the <unk> .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype that &apos;s my prototype , but it was pretty helpful to put it on a branch that was on , and pressure and pressure was up to high pressure , and that was the pressure of the thing that &apos;s been broken .
and then i took a <unk> and it &apos;s attached to it .
a <unk> , if you make the full of water , the enough pressure , so i think about it , so maybe 40 to <unk> bar , right .
and so you can get that kind of particles that speed up and then go into the onion in the onion .
and the commercial device is about <unk> euro or something , <unk> <unk> , so to the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically <unk> .
so , the way that is , is the <unk> , the <unk> of the scene , and the <unk> of technology and also the information that &apos;s more of the people that are able to get there .
because the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a little bit of a little bit of knowing and also no way to make it really good .
because if you read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself or saw it .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you could do as a <unk> citizen , and you can make a decision to make a decision and to make their own , you need access to knowledge and to the technology .
and you have to do it , and you have to understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> of the <unk> open and the future science is science .
so that &apos;s how citizens are being put into the position of the state , and they &apos;re going through these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> ratio of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least officially , on the website , <unk> website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , that &apos;s because there are fewer people , as actually exist .
so i know some of you who don &apos;t have .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
and partly with these <unk> , these places are going to be there .
and that &apos;s very early in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> , it &apos;s just started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , <unk> <unk> , who are represented anywhere in the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to move , and then , as much as well , we &apos;re also concerned with each other , and that &apos;s how we can also get more to people .
and i would invite everyone else to engage in this and even another time .
it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you &apos;re not having enough curiosity and enough energy , you &apos;ll get enough energy , you &apos;re too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi .
how do we work people actually ?
this is a question that is very much moved to me as designer designer , but also in the field of <unk> and all kinds of things in the area of the world .
there &apos;s how to run people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create them to create an experience of the experience .
i think that the interactive media inside us <unk> cognitive models , the paradigm of that kind of thing , that &apos;s what &apos;s been <unk> in our biological memory , very long time , and that we just can just create an interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you think that these <unk> <unk> that you &apos;ve encountered , that the future is actually , actually , the future is to actually be the same in us , in our roots , in fact , in our roots .
so what are actually <unk> models ?
i &apos;m going to shout out four <unk> and i want to explain to you briefly .
so to <unk> cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times of us .
to these <unk> models , we &apos;re hearing a <unk> of natural relationship .
this is basically a unusual thing .
and i &apos;m going to take a look at that same time and i &apos;m going to prove you to prove that you &apos;re a natural relationship with you .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk about these <unk> models , very much more powerful , even more powerful , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself itself .
we all know that the interactive media is <unk> by definition , which is the <unk> of the linearity , and what of course is that we &apos;re saying that we &apos;re normal today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us to be a place of the <unk> .
now , what &apos;s about with virtuality is the most powerful thing the most powerful thing is about the world .
i want to prove you to prove it .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
so we won &apos;t be able to speculate , to be able to speculate , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> , they &apos;re living and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
they <unk> reality , which is a very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a way for us to make a <unk> approach in the <unk> of our own fluctuating shows , which is actually the whole time we can do it all the time .
and these assets that are virtual reality that have needed the people in the same time that people would need to be <unk> , because they didn &apos;t .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
they had no mass mass .
the only thing that had been her head was her head .
and in this head , the memory was played .
in this head , <unk> knowledge and through these virtual images , the imagination , were also passed on to be on the other , and then we know , was that we were also passed .
and so it &apos;s so much in us , that we can deal with virtuality so that we can deal with the virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that the human being <unk> and medium is the medium .
so now , if you go to a piece of a piece .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll be a little bit to talk about it .
the primary tool of the <unk> have been rejected since the ancient .
<unk> , priests , <unk> , <unk> , were allowed to maintain knowledge in stories .
and also , we &apos;re still going to be very , very powerful .
the author of the book of the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we &apos;re still running <unk> hours of <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a kid that &apos;s been around to reach the way that most of his life has spent most of the time of the story of the story of stories .
now we think we &apos;re telling stories of stories on the way we sat down on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
so that &apos;s going to go back to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but in the domain of the interactive media as special as we have , we have a <unk> in <unk> in our biological memory , and we have to think of <unk> in our biological memory .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the <unk> .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate because of an island , coming from island to the island to get food .
and they did this with something called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
you may know , you know , if you &apos;re interested in a little bit of the australian people &apos;s australian plague .
they have similar principles .
they have no <unk> , but they have used as <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the <unk> and the topography of the <unk> could be mapped to songs .
which was the language of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s called you <unk> about sound and you rhythm .
and these sound and the rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region that &apos;s determined to be able to <unk> these songs and they could sit down and they sit down and they could move back to the left and also to move back to the right and back to the street .
why don &apos;t we sing the way to get from a b to b ?
anyway , it &apos;s not going to navigate .
what &apos;s happened in that ?
it &apos;s the way that &apos;s the <unk> machine machine .
we &apos;ve got this <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s the age of the age of the age , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s what &apos;s happened .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the way that we have shifted to the <unk> of our individual memories .
and on the book , the image .
so we actually have a <unk> of god &apos;s a piece of <unk> .
so what &apos;s a sudden , <unk> <unk> for us being <unk> , has nothing more to do .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , is so far to say that these mass mass extinctions , he &apos;s like the book and so on , so what we call as mass mass , and so on , what we call mass mass of our memories , and so on the <unk> of the <unk> .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
the <unk> for the machine machine .
what has changed our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the <unk> is <unk> &apos;s influence .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> in the <unk> of the centuries of the <unk> .
so , instead of remember , we &apos;ve been <unk> , we &apos;ve been very common , very common , in masses of bats that we can hang our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce much more .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think the thing in these images don &apos;t even more in images , but we &apos;re <unk> them in the way that we call our language .
we used to have used to happen that things happen .
and we &apos;re the linearity as law and there are only exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left with us is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re very <unk> as a <unk> , very much arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s going to happen ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age of machine , and we &apos;re going to take this so-called <unk> .
and this sounds very <unk> and sound like <unk> , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> that are bringing us back to these possibilities again .
there &apos;s a matter of complication , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain a little bit more .
there &apos;s technical concepts like this , like the <unk> reality , that &apos;s the augmented reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , you see , then the concept of the virtual world with the real world is to combine the virtual world with the real world , which is called the virtual world , which is to be supported by a normal , natural way .
another example is that a virtual reality .
so , of course , the thing that &apos;s crazy about the context of my presentation , because we &apos;re not putting ourselves into <unk> , virtual worlds , all the model of the <unk> model .
and another one example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people to people .
all this needs the capacity to be creating , to accept , to accept more secure habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the end and i hope , the video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also here .
you might just get up to get up , so you can pause in pause with the two of the project .
and this project i &apos;ve brought as an example of how to get the <unk> of these <unk> , cognitive models .
all this is a game , i have to say .
and of course , what &apos;s extremely <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , you probably have very likely to be very , people know people who are <unk> people or they &apos;re playing with some of them with some of the <unk> in their hands .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in the inside .
that &apos;s a game for outside .
and that &apos;s in the way that i think i discover the outside world , so i think the real world &apos;s going to discover .
and this game connects to the virtual world , so the data that we produce , to make the real world .
i &apos;m sorry i have to be a lot of this .
you can explain to you a lot more time , because there &apos;s more much more than more than that .
and it &apos;s about a city that i see a city of being positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get from the city to a completely different sense , which i see negative negative and positive zones of a city and you get a very different city , and you get a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here is sorry , is a little bit of a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world is in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that , i &apos;m going to summarize my talk and the skills that the properties of the <unk> and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;ve gotten a little bit of <unk> , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the <unk> of the so-called <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;re in the way of thinking about complex , new products .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be .
i &apos;ve been asked , if this bag is a bag of a bag of a bag , and i &apos;m talking to my talk .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m going to skip the same thing that &apos;s inside .
but i &apos;m not going to be curious , i &apos;m just curious about it .
yes , children are kind of curious about nature or be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a designer of the house , so i &apos;m involved in the subject of curiosity and how much the curiosity do , and how much the curiosity we think about , and why we might also have , and we have to go and get too much more and more .
that &apos;s a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with the actual subject of a <unk> .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
a <unk> for the theme of natural user interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask you why all the designers are going to be with as natural , <unk> communication , and then we &apos;re going to work and engaging in .
and there &apos;s just one of these little devices that are going to be <unk> , because things are always more more , more natural , and there you have to look at what &apos;s actually human beings , of what &apos;s natural , of course , of course .
and before the background , i have a natural natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computers in the way that human computers are doing with the human brain , how our tools , or how the computer <unk> from the computer to the digital <unk> .
so i &apos;ve been busy focusing on what &apos;s natural or intuitively .
maybe you have to look at this one .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , right here , right now , we &apos;re going to move forward to the third one , or <unk> , right now .
so from modern in the <unk> .
every society is a <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> through the language .
that &apos;s what you &apos;ve found , so you &apos;ve got to talk about a common language , and you could communicate with each other cave , and in other areas , cities educated , or towns , educated , educated , educated , <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , a little bit of natural , a little living .
so you had to learn to speak , so not a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it and we &apos;re learning .
and that &apos;s what they would then then then saved through the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because of course , the living language was the living language of the script , and the <unk> of the script , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be , and i &apos;m going to go and <unk> it in stone and so i &apos;m <unk> .
and as i <unk> , and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a whole different thing , and when i think it &apos;s a very different story , when you kind of think of it .
but then , <unk> would then be a <unk> , got <unk> .
then the next generation , which is actually mainly primarily about life .
this is the <unk> and <unk> <unk> script with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was a <unk> , where <unk> , <unk> and other people have said , are you really crazy when people are getting to read , then you want to pick up and pick it up .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation , and the exciting is , so a <unk> is just a few hundred years and we &apos;re really in the moment in this phase of time that we &apos;re going to work out of this time .
and the <unk> of course of course , is that we see on the one side of the media , social media media &apos;s media , facebook and so on .
with absolute transparency , what &apos;s the new thinking about what the old thinking is , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> , <unk> , don &apos;t tell beef , and other phenomena , i just want to <unk> it , and i want to <unk> it .
and these two worlds just , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing about this is if you look at the scene , this new society , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> of the <unk> .
but now not more at the local level , but on a global scale .
we understand that the weather is global .
that &apos;s the theme of ecology &apos;s global global ecology .
not if i think locally , i think you &apos;re going to be a local , and your neighbor &apos;s less environmentally environmentally , working .
that means , from local village , is a global village , with the same principles , of course , but the total transparency of being intuitively , but also the total transparency transparency .
so as you know , who knew what happened to whom , what happens to whom is what happens to us , and when we , these are the <unk> of our own mobile phone &apos;s mobile phone &apos;s mobile .
it &apos;s that we know that we need global breeding and faster and always better .
so as it was in the village , it was happening to the village .
before the background , i just got to see what is that , what is it , what is it , what &apos;s the other , of course , what we might have , but also , what &apos;s the same thing , what does the difference ?
because often , people are coming , can &apos;t make it <unk> , so everyone can evade them .
so you have to engage in this , and it &apos;s not just changing it , and it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s going to be better , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and when of course , of course , something is very different and how can i take a model of influence and so forth , and so the things that are so intuitive , because they &apos;re making fun , because they &apos;re making fun and they &apos;re just going to use them .
you &apos;re also concerned with that , and also , as a result , the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and this is , of course , what you start starting and look like , and look , right now , i just look at all the inner self .
and what &apos;s it actually looks like ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re <unk> ?
and what does , of course , of course , is intuitively , intuitively , and how does our channels of the channels of perception and how does the cognitive process ?
because steve jobs once said , you know , you <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , to <unk> it .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something more or intuitively , what is that the core is what the core .
and there &apos;s a one of our seven senses that most of us are , you know , we &apos;ve only got five <unk> , right now , it &apos;s now seven , and it &apos;s still in the next future , and as an extension of our own , more important sense of self .
and to look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
by themselves , what &apos;s information is because information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
so many use the word , but not at all , what it means is to be able to all that detail .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature , when you understand information , when they &apos;re going to know information , information information and from information , so i know how to do things that are very intuitive or can now make it happen to be very intuitive .
and of course , what &apos;s design is about perception .
and we &apos;re looking at this , if i make things , i can be <unk> , like , what &apos;s salt and pepper , i can make it , what &apos;s salt and pepper , i can make it a intuitive intuitive by doing things .
so much natural natural is a <unk> , but i see a straight , where is salt and pepper .
and if i tell somebody , give me a salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to be thinking about the right thing , where is what is inside .
and when the left , they &apos;re very intuitive , and i hope that &apos;s not a sugar sport that &apos;s not there to be salt .
but also our perception of self , how does they feel us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the small , although not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet , the way changes our perceptions , and yet changes how context is the world .
does anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n .
a second circle begins to endure , and then associate that .
and if i go down a <unk> , you &apos;re not just going to just see a unity , which is , and we &apos;re going to see a unity , and we see a unit , we &apos;re not seeing more three parts , a circle , a circle , another circle , another circle .
it &apos;s something called <unk> or <unk> , which is also affected us in perception .
so important for the designers that have the most semester , the great <unk> , the great <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s closeness , <unk> that the continuity and so on .
so often forget about the third one .
but that &apos;s an essential component of being , if you want things to be able to design things that are very intuitive to the same time .
the next thing , which is very interesting that &apos;s what &apos;s very interesting about .
sound is very trivial , but it &apos;s just so exciting to be preoccupied with it .
so we start the eyes and now think we &apos;re looking at the front , and we &apos;re going to see from the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can start to start from the back .
and they &apos;re <unk> an assumption , and they &apos;re looking at what you recognize , <unk> circle .
that &apos;s what we call our vision , we just see what we see , back to the back in our <unk> , saying , okay , all right , right ?
i have a cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what <unk> what you want to see .
that &apos;s what &apos;s there , then , that &apos;s coming back back .
and then again , again , again , because the back of the back of the back , it doesn &apos;t really look at the back and you &apos;re going to be , and you know , if you look at it , you know , what you &apos;re like , is that what you want to see .
and then again , it &apos;s back to the back and then it &apos;s just not seen .
so a whole , very smooth process , how things happen and what &apos;s going to happen for these things are going to happen .
i don &apos;t know who knows this image .
and there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something that is something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
does anybody see something particular ?
a <unk> , right .
once i saw that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know , you know .
they &apos;re never going to forget about it , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so , i &apos;ve actually <unk> them in the <unk> that you &apos;re not aware of the kind of <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;ve got them to see them in a very short time , and i &apos;ve got them to see that the dog in the <unk> picture .
and this is the projection of view , <unk> , see .
now i know it &apos;s now , and now i &apos;m going to see the <unk> <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that then , you know , gray is not actually not , but here in this <unk> mass in this mass , just just the case just happen .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
it &apos;s for long .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know about something about three seconds , until i sort of <unk> the present , i can also <unk> very well <unk> <unk> , where i &apos;m always a very good <unk> .
it &apos;s just to process as a present .
then it goes into the past , and i can bridge very elegant , like the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s going to do is <unk> ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love .
that means , if you know this , you &apos;re just paying you who are looking at the same , because i don &apos;t take a <unk> for what &apos;s going on .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most perceptions , which we have .
that &apos;s what happens to be quickly fast speed at a fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things that we &apos;re looking at , and how we could also protect ourselves from our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the designers are not only about perceptions about perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> , but mostly of course on the issue of <unk> .
so , like a human being , a human being around .
there &apos;s a little <unk> of the practical functions , so <unk> aspects of the things or <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where i need to reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why is someone who &apos;s not a little <unk> , where doesn &apos;t matter what <unk> money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
so we &apos;re more on the <unk> , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , we also have a deal of a creator .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface , and the theme of which is , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> always means how can i quickly reach out to be a certain goal , or how can a users can be in a certain way , efficient and <unk> .
so , what &apos;s the norm is that the norm .
how can i make something more ?
i can use that directly or i need to be <unk> , or i need to be the <unk> of it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that &apos;s just a different thing and a beautiful thing , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re looking at that , you &apos;re going to understand why <unk> percent of our current software are very intuitive or not to use <unk> , which is a lot more intuitive to be a classic , or <unk> , although it &apos;s already more intuitive to the traditional software .
and this is an intuitive video designer &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , if i wanted to make some technological devices , to make people useful .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re going through these new kinds of <unk> , so the natural user user &apos;s natural gas is on average , for example , five times less likely to our destination .
you have to imagine that , if you &apos;re making something of the classic <unk> , you need to take five hours , and with this new kind of natural software for one new software .
so that doesn &apos;t mean that you could probably get four hours of a living , but your employers or anyone , you know , how it &apos;s going to work with the four hours to deal with .
but i want to say that it &apos;s an accurate <unk> of course , and it &apos;s a very certain thing to get things .
so if we &apos;re going to put together again in the domain of the software , there &apos;s the first <unk> of the first line of interfaces that were very abstract to deal with these systems .
then the next thing that came already with a <unk> neural model , or mental model like the software <unk> , and they &apos;ve worked a notion of something that &apos;s metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so not more zeros and ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
so that &apos;s what it was doing all the way , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m doing this as a designer designer , and i think a lot more often do that .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that &apos;s what i think that is always <unk> for success , right now the <unk> is a app app .
and then if i could , then a step of <unk> into these natural user interface , where i &apos;m a voice , or a language , by the gesture , and no more than mouse and <unk> to drive the things , i &apos;m still going to drive it up , and i &apos;m still going on .
so , i &apos;m going to turn this to the point , when are things going , is the things that are more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to take my little friend and look at a little friend of <unk> and you see what &apos;s going on , right ?
and that &apos;s for us , people are always a bit of the kind of intuitively , if i have to think about it .
so it doesn &apos;t want to think , but it &apos;s just going to be just in just letting it .
i &apos;m the less one i think about this , the more , more intuitive .
and what does that mean for designers ?
so , if we look at that , we can actually transfer that we could put existing <unk> from one thing to another , for example , that &apos;s what i &apos;m using as a designer .
that means i can just take an intuitive , a <unk> , a software engineer to make the software central software .
so , of course , the question of , what is the most <unk> <unk> of us people and now i have a bit of the time .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> , each of us and <unk> is an acronym and it stands for you to be able to get <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s all of you all of you all of the time , but it &apos;s not harmful , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly , or partly instinctively .
the model is already <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it &apos;s the world &apos;s junior and old , and it &apos;s being used for us all the time , without knowing that most of the most people have there .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> to <unk> , even more than activity , so in their sleep , and in their sleep , it &apos;s got less often less than a day .
i can now multiply this mental <unk> , <unk> , inform , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and through these kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the <unk> , now , it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> object , but a metaphor of a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of <unk> , as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i <unk> this , for example , in which i &apos;m being sucked as a <unk> , <unk> as a choice , i &apos;m going to see it &apos;s big , i can look at it in the details , and i can see it in the details , and you can store it or so on .
then i can transfer this whole thing .
i &apos;m going to try this through a <unk> .
they &apos;ve got a little bit of cake .
<unk> : now i use the object , can i sort of <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
i get the whole of <unk> , can now filter this and say , just show me all the time with chocolate .
and once a interface , what &apos;s a lot more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach the things like the bits of <unk> , and they come to me , is considerably more natural than if you can make it <unk> <unk> , or other mechanisms , to make these things available .
imagination is more powerful <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence i like to close , a and <unk> , too , also , a few , a lot to think about the new solutions , and i &apos;m very careful , and i &apos;m very careful with her attention .
i want to give you to a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re being a child , as a baby , is that you care about what you have , you know , what you have , you know , what you have , you know , if your parents have allowed them to play , more or less in the <unk> , the more , kind of , will , kind of , will , sort of , will , in the <unk> , of course , is going to be more curiosity .
and the curiosity don &apos;t learn .
because of all these are all these are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
now i &apos;m about to think about this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years , <unk> in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this process .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you give them a little bit of the time , two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
they can &apos;t have bone bone .
we could just run as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we did not , we &apos;re not going to take phosphorus and do .
so , amazingly , we &apos;re here , we &apos;re looking at something that was a <unk> <unk> , but not so much .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus for two years , and already now , through the <unk> world , much more uranium into the environment , than all the <unk> is being used in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> metric tons of uranium in the fields in germany .
and we take that all .
it &apos;s <unk> with children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re slightly harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , drive less car .
<unk> the environment , make less trash .
the environment , the environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not an protection .
that &apos;s how i would say , <unk> your child , it doesn &apos;t even throw it three times as five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit of destruction .
if we think about the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire earth will be , or then a <unk> , or later a <unk> .
so from the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the bottom , first of the first time .
in the soil , over a <unk> <unk> is saved by <unk> .
we &apos;re going to start corn and lose between 11 and 30 pounds of 30 miles per hectare per hectare per hectare , or on the square meter .
that is , we &apos;re losing the ground in the ground , like five times more than a new educated .
we can see of course the <unk> of the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or content .
in <unk> , for instance , is about <unk> twenty percent of the <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , the <unk> will be larger .
that &apos;s all you &apos;re in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby takes a baby six thousand .
so , of course , we could reduce this 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these <unk> ?
here &apos;s an proof of proof of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted by the <unk> constituents of the fine .
people about the urine .
yeah .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s the <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think we &apos;re in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you think people who exist when you &apos;re saying it would better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not there , then you &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> .
and so someone like al gore , one of our big heroes , there are nothing more <unk> than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you &apos;ll say if you &apos;re <unk> a life , you &apos;re <unk> the earth .
here &apos;s what you say , the more you are more <unk> .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too much ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of ants on earth , then , then , then the ants , you weigh more than four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the u.s. , no one of the same things that &apos;s been like , in the same way , although they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we .
and because they &apos;re much more adept working than we &apos;re living and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re just in their weight , in their weight , in the energy consumption , the more 30 billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too much too stupid , we &apos;re not stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we were going to really wanted to achieve , and we could be , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re on the earth , you can see that for instance , for instance , is a program to be <unk> , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a tree tree ?
yeah ?
one ?
so , our whole intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be <unk> as a trees , right ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily , yes ? yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> trees in trees .
there are still six inches in the still operating room .
you &apos;ve heard about something about <unk> trees from trees ?
meaning , all our intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be <unk> as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not allow our own <unk> to go back .
every year we &apos;re going to have three million tons of phosphorus , which is going to go back into the bottom .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel like to be so guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and just like all the means that our own name will go back to the <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be a good force to be a <unk> , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to try to try and try to try and do a big footprint , but it &apos;s a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it goes around the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
they only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot a shoot , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture where we regain the nutrients .
we can actually get in this way of nutrients in agriculture .
so we do this in china for example , where we &apos;re going to take the waste of it .
in china , a <unk> is a <unk> , so , in a way , it &apos;s a <unk> ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to <unk> our nutrients .
that &apos;s called the whole western <unk> of that town , that the city has always been taken , but the farmers never have a bit returned .
and so the cities are growing more because the farmers went into the cities and the farmers had to keep the way they had to move away from their water sources .
all of the western empires are over , and they &apos;re not going to have the infrastructure and they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve got <unk> civilization over five years of making because you always have to get the nutrients out of the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat the food in china , you would expect to be the food that you &apos;re going to stay in the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to go and take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them invited to dinner , not to <unk> .
that &apos;s what you can see on the internet , how you can regain the nutrients .
this is what &apos;s beautiful about this , if you do this , agriculture , a <unk> , a hectare of the country with five in the favelas , so that &apos;s a farmer and the <unk> , and the <unk> and the pig , and the <unk> and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs and the herbs
and the great thing is that the <unk> <unk> in the favelas of the world are over over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people that are not going to be very bad .
we can support them , well , be good .
that &apos;s of course , of course , but the plants are wearing itself .
the <unk> is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to be , by design , the farmer , they can just <unk> the farmer .
that means that the <unk> comes back .
and none of these facilities , we have now built over <unk> in the last 20 years , not from these facilities , none of these facilities ever ever ever been .
you could just <unk> a pint of <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> will be ruin over years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people that are not going to be very bad .
we can support them , well , be good .
that is , we need to have phosphorus <unk> .
and by the way , if you want to do what they &apos;re doing , they &apos;re the best to the best treatment of all the treatment in <unk> .
unfortunately , the <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> , you know , a little bit of help .
because the <unk> facility could be the best coming back .
and that &apos;s got to go back .
we see that the phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really done .
we &apos;ve been using three years now .
the dutch government explains they will be the first country in the world , which is what phosphorus is going to be .
but we need this overall overall overall .
understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s overall world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of the control of the control .
and the oil will replace us by other energy .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
so it &apos;s not about to make the existing existing ratio of being able to make a little bit of bad , but it &apos;s about something right .
and it &apos;s all of all of the questions , what &apos;s the right thing .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not to efficiency .
in the holland , you know , you get this easier because in holland , the land is built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad your wife &apos;s wife if you have them , and you &apos;re having them <unk> , and you come with 50 .
completely inefficient .
but very , very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , is about six <unk> three kilograms of life in the same way of life .
it &apos;s about .
it &apos;s not a scientific thing , because because we don &apos;t know exactly how much more <unk> is going to be .
but a <unk> , even in this lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , and it &apos;s really effective , right ?
one thing that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
so just in the process of not efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
so what &apos;s the right thing ?
not to burn the <unk> , a little better and <unk> it to the <unk> and to lose it to the <unk> all materials , but first to ask , how do you get the cycles ?
so , imagine mozart .
yeah ?
if i go back to dinner , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass water .
wonderful , &quot; it &apos;s a ? &quot;
that &apos;s efficient .
everything is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
if you fall in love , efficiently ?
yeah ?
that means everything in life is not about saving , avoiding , to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , well , you know , you don &apos;t have green green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , right ?
every place you &apos;re doing , where you &apos;re <unk> , you can get back to the <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we think in the north , we &apos;re from north .
there is every footprint that &apos;s <unk> .
if you walk , yes , they &apos;re <unk> the floor .
because the ground is going to die , the mosses will die , and the water washing water washing away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every time you &apos;re in italy , that &apos;s the water that &apos;s going to stay in the meadow .
so it &apos;s about to create a big footprint that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yeah ?
but if i ask them , how do you get your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
so this is the minimum .
so not saving , <unk> , avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , you can kick out the <unk> and you know .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a <unk> form of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , there are beautiful .
so , for example , we developed a <unk> <unk> that is in temperature .
they can <unk> , where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re starting all over .
and it contains seeds seeds of rare plants that are going to do with the rest of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two loops .
not all of it should be <unk> .
a tv or a washing machine , which is just using them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who must be so that they &apos;re going to go into biological systems .
the things that are just being used to do in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
and it &apos;s very direct advertising , not for the company <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s that you &apos;re helping now to help this business , these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do that , we don &apos;t do the things anymore .
yeah ?
so , if i go to the dinner , and you say , that &apos;s free of <unk> , and it &apos;s not all the time .
no , we &apos;re putting what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic .
but it &apos;s all in that inside , it &apos;s useful .
so these are the first pair of shoes you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> in biological space , right ?
all of it is <unk> .
and if it works , it &apos;s going to be able to do it for <unk> , for nike , for nike and <unk> and the whole industry .
and this is half of all the <unk> around the world that will cause the textile industry .
so they help them , ask , people , they ask for people .
hey , <unk> , is your real real ?
because they have now been twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m really sure you &apos;re really <unk> .
so , help me do a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s just been shown by .
that &apos;s going .
so we can do things now that when you &apos;re <unk> , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can enter into biological spaces .
technical spaces are the same .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological <unk> , in fact , that &apos;s made to go back into the cycle .
so , the store , so in every store , you can <unk> things .
if you come to that , yes ?
remember the <unk> time ?
if the moment is the trash .
all these <unk> are around , almost almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
so , there &apos;s a front jump on the <unk> , but otherwise in the landscapes , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that he can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside , it &apos;s going to be <unk> in israel , then you can plant trees in israel , or in tunisia , trees .
yeah ?
so just if you take these <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , to plant trees , to plant trees .
so this is the baby <unk> for the entire life , already at the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so , sort of .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can invent everything even time .
i started a institute .
now there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all engage them .
there &apos;s an extra club to <unk> , where anyone can be involved .
so no longer save , apart , avoid , avoiding , reduce , not <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you do that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that as a <unk> , i &apos;m a <unk> , so i understand myself in english , and i understand it in the english <unk> .
<unk> is a translator &apos;s written on the written notes in <unk> music .
you don &apos;t just want to mention the word of word games in a different language , but the deeper sense of the words , but to understand the deeper sense of words and <unk> it , so it makes a good translation of it , knowing it .
already in german english , can require more knowledge , more knowledge , because when you &apos;re in , poetry , if you &apos;re about poetry or all the poetry .
so , very <unk> is it &apos;s a <unk> , what we do with the musician to do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> , i just started the master notes .
you think of the fact that the roman <unk> has just <unk> everything that he thought was there .
in fact , the grades are very different and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly exactly the same or <unk> , like a verbal verbal , albeit a <unk> description , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> video , the smell of flowers is not to smell , the <unk> of the <unk> just to hear the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s called the epitome of the conservation data set of the <unk> of the <unk> in another , namely , concrete , <unk> , <unk> .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m going to translate to other other words , which is a verbal language to translate into language .
so basically translation translation .
so i prefer to do that all the time in german because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to me in english translation translation of translation .
so the music is , so much like the spoken word of language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letter of a script .
so it doesn &apos;t take you just to learn to read the notes , and press the keys on the piano or the right thing to match the right thing on a <unk> .
that &apos;s just the letters that you learned to paint , painting .
the point of the letters is , you know , if you can &apos;t get the language to the language .
so , you need to have the process of music process for the process of the music , just as long as the spoken speech .
there &apos;s also a <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , just passively understands , or you can talk to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts to look like the <unk> .
after you first had chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> to the emergence of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read the <unk> , <unk> , notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s a <unk> , thoughts .
you studied the works that he was about and then composed .
you compare comparison .
the <unk> , it &apos;s writing .
and what &apos;s the thing that does ?
how were his circumstances of how society and politics ?
all this is interested .
you think of it in time , by example , in the same time , in the contemporary , you know , contemporary pictures .
but the time you have a physicality of the unfortunate knowledge of the composers that you &apos;re going to play with more and more and it &apos;s always easier to feel it , and feel easier to feel in it .
the composer is always going to be a friend that you &apos;re living together .
his cause to write the piece , is more and more and more to my personal concerns .
so , there &apos;s the notes of the word , the notes of the evil , but just a framework , i turn a framework , and i turn this framework to make sense of meaning , and meaning to the meaning of meaning .
i &apos;m going to say that in my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play <unk> , which could mean that these sound could have .
now for me , for me , for me , for the composers , what you could mean to do this today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense of a sense because i feel it myself because it comes from my personal <unk> .
it &apos;s got to be <unk> for me and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to convince that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert concert , if i could have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve learned as long as i &apos;ve done , i &apos;ve spent a lot of the time .
and as a happy , happy new day you &apos;ve ever met again , although always the same rituals of life , they &apos;re getting their hands , and they &apos;re all the same thing as i always did , and they always take the same piece over the new .
i &apos;ve become a day of older , and i &apos;ve become a day , my pulse , my pulse , at night , in a <unk> , a <unk> , it takes the sound to home the sound of the sound .
i take the breath of the day , or you &apos;re not breathing .
all this influenced me and all that influences me , and all that &apos;s happening .
so , wonderful is also , if i stand up with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea and then you &apos;ll get this answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things that we don &apos;t have so much of the time that we have not <unk> and not yet .
it &apos;s great fun to do music , and you &apos;ve seen the audience , then you &apos;ve experienced the music that &apos;s communicating with the music .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this .
i can &apos;t play today as a 20 years .
there &apos;s more <unk> than today , than today , and i &apos;m going to be more <unk> , and emotion , and emotion is more much more powerful than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but for the new <unk> .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of the <unk> in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot of young , so i was <unk> , when i finally went to study .
but i was very lucky enough , i was very early , and i was to meet at the age of 13 , and i was already to my school classes .
i was at the time when i was in one of his courses again and i played the last one of the four of the chopin , a <unk> of the chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of these were the <unk> for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he <unk> and he thought , this ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , they &apos;re memory .
he was about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have a dream of dreams , but not significant memories .
i &apos;m going to play this for every few years , and always it &apos;s not a single note that has a single note .
so every time you &apos;re excited , i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of a completely different area . and amazon.com has made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to make a different <unk> , <unk> light .
he &apos;s got the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as she looked at it for him .
his personal favorite <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now i &apos;ve been as much as a record , as a record , a <unk> years ago , when he wrote the piece .
he was only <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even though i think you &apos;re <unk> .
and keep keeping <unk> , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you know , you need to have a lot of the spoken word for the spoken word .
often , the <unk> is the <unk> , you know , you &apos;re learning the notes .
you know , you &apos;re learning to read the first thing until you &apos;re talking about one word .
you learn to find the notes to the music on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time , it &apos;s just like the notes , and then you get the notes , you get notes that sound like music .
if you happen to get this carefully &apos;s nest , the students will get the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s not talking about it &apos;s spoken in the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s a good thing , that &apos;s the front panel , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , f , f , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
but even if you put these data , it &apos;s still just slightly technical .
and yet , it &apos;s not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget some sort of <unk> .
because , to make music on the instrument , make your own musical , feel about it should be present before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learned the singing , because it &apos;s not the parents who have no idea of themselves .
this is like the <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music , and then you have to get the idea of a more option , so you can make it a way to sound .
people who never responded to <unk> , have never felt immediately immediately in their body , as it is , to make a sound .
so a phrase is a <unk> .
the instrument is , because the <unk> of our bodies .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of my fingers .
the melody comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm of your dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays is not <unk> with music .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself even more music when it &apos;s going to be a boring .
no more needed to whistle a football or singing .
every person gets <unk> , if you &apos;re all the time out of music with music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what if i don &apos;t sing , if i don &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m going to sing , you can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they &apos;re not singing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
and at two , it &apos;s not too late to do that , to find out whether they couldn &apos;t yet , or learn how to do these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , right .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re training .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it , you know , they &apos;re <unk> .
so i wonder how <unk> was that diagnosis ?
have you ever got a <unk> or <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music , and therefore , you don &apos;t want to do failure .
but what i would regret was , because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you can see , all of the cases don &apos;t have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say , don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it is good or bad .
i &apos;m going to answer , but surely you can tell you , or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s somebody , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t get rid of the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to push out classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; if it tastes you or not .
whether the music is too <unk> or too sweet .
tell me what you feel .
and the time you get involved in the time , and you want to be a little bit more spices there or taste is even fine differences .
why am i asking my audience now that you can listen to the people &apos;s active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate with .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force to work .
the food that &apos;s been eating by a chef or a chef <unk> , to eat , not just looked at or <unk> .
so you can hear a music when a music is played .
she &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a neighborhood where adults are actively making music or to even active music , a child grows up , then it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> , to ask , what color has got your flower ?
can you play it in blue ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , rather than a red red now , rather than a blue flower .
and this is kind of different than before .
that &apos;s the first beginning of a human being , <unk> .
so the first step is to be a interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re playing a piece of a hundred , before a hundred hundred ago , or three hundred years ago , or three hundred years ago , or three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have <unk> .
there was the time that the time gets an instrument to do not at all the time .
it wasn &apos;t actually invented .
i think that bach would have been excited if he had had the <unk> possibilities of modern <unk> .
i can now <unk> the <unk> that bach &apos;s carrying , in the modern wings to sound what a <unk> <unk> can &apos;t .
even beethoven knows that he was more heard when he was deaf .
today , is a modern orchestra in which everything is a orchestra , which has been rejected as a <unk> .
so the composers rely on us rely on the <unk> that &apos;s back to reinvent the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be audible , what you &apos;ve dreamed of in mind .
and also , what you would think in the mind would think of you today .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were you already <unk> ?
and how does that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend , which is a <unk> .
if i come to my little <unk> w , i was going to be the <unk> , and i get the feeling of this feeling .
i &apos;m taking a little through the head .
i say , <unk> , what would you need to do so ?
this is the first year , the half of his value was the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i have to do this , &quot; i have a little car ?
and then immediately , i immediately think that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say , justice , this is the awkward feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to make these uncomfortable feelings like envy and make it just to go away .
you can also try and do it with words like <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
i want to tell you something today , something you see today , or something you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism is from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might have heard , when people say , nobody has to build a wall wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he &apos;s going to give them the view of the view .
at a lie like this such a lie that the number of the good self is saying .
it &apos;s easy to check it out of the way it has a different sense of meaning .
it &apos;s just not <unk> them , not even himself .
no , the <unk> that i &apos;m talking about is to make them deceive you .
they need this lie to get a <unk> to get a permanent upright .
you can get less easy , yes , <unk> or also bring down the poles .
they need time .
so , again , an anecdote is an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter , once a woman , has a woman .
this woman has <unk> her portrait , the portrait would not see her .
picasso says only .
it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
and if you laugh , you see how important that lie is , and how much time you need to experience something about what artists can tell us to experience something very well .
because artists have a <unk> ratio .
the artist &apos;s artist , and particularly , in particular , this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see if you look just in the mirror .
the artist gives you a portrait of a portrait with what you &apos;re going to be familiar with , if you &apos;re going to look at this piece of work .
then this uncomfortable feeling of the awkward feeling , it could not look at it at all , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar to them .
here &apos;s how you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to use our <unk> .
and not just in the arts , even in the <unk> , in the mythology , in the mythology , in stories .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him who is the nicest world in all country ?
and one day , this mirrors , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you know how much hostility out of this true thing , the mirrors cannot lie , and the mirrors of that true is <unk> .
but we should be familiar with that , you know , you can &apos;t tell a woman &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s needed , what we &apos;re going to understand in the <unk> of <unk> , again , again .
we need this lie that &apos;s lying to us , we &apos;re <unk> ourselves , without that we can &apos;t yet yet .
we have not just in the art that &apos;s in the art of the <unk> , but also in science such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s wife &apos;s <unk> .
and they heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of the human .
that person should be <unk> by the person , and yes , at least there was a common ancestors between people and monkeys .
and she would run her husband to her husband and said , that &apos;s not true , what charles is there .
the person is supposed to be by the monkey or a common ancestors .
no , no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent people from this , and then we need to know that people will come .
why is we need to prevent people from some of the things that &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live in these <unk> .
because we &apos;re <unk> , this feeling , great , <unk> from the highest creatures , not by a <unk> , of something like an organism that exists to be a stone , comparable to the things that &apos;s still <unk> .
so , we can &apos;t have these things .
we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge capacity for things , especially , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism , and how the traces look like that he leaves the other , and what &apos;s the great picture of ourselves as a beautiful picture of ourselves , i want to share with you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife has told me .
she came from one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a 16-year-old student .
she likes to like him , because he &apos;s an alternative to <unk> .
and she asked him what &apos;s your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m the firemen .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re not at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , always , if a person is a moral <unk> , because we &apos;re using the <unk> , we should try to replace it through the mri <unk> particle .
do you take that one and then experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the biology .
so a little <unk> , which is not interested in the <unk> .
the interest is the interest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no <unk> that we can look around , where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s just the second second , you know the firemen .
and he &apos;s got the <unk> .
and <unk> , you know , his teacher doesn &apos;t tell you , you like to put a <unk> somewhere , and when the fire gets <unk> after you get <unk> .
no , it &apos;s just better better than we show that we &apos;re involved in this way that we &apos;re involved in the dangers of the other , and they &apos;re just going to fire the fire .
here &apos;s this little mechanism there .
these <unk> that have been known that in the <unk> of the <unk> , that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he &apos;s not saying it &apos;s not saying .
so here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious of the unconscious , and the <unk> that you can do something about it , and the things that you know , they &apos;re very different , so they can sound much better for them and others .
so then we &apos;re just kind of like words that we &apos;re talking about the political language , and we &apos;re using the political right .
in fact , we know something else is that .
but we know when we &apos;re doing the word , the social views are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to be able to do things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to argue to you now what we found in my institute .
so what &apos;s the ironic , these <unk> , the willingness , a different reality , a different reality of what we actually know already , is that they &apos;re not supposed to be the first to spread out .
so , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example of a prediction is ahead , and some of you appreciate it , and some of them are not going to need very few .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so little <unk> , says , about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about <unk> , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the damage that are the damage , or you can also tell you the belief that they &apos;ve been gestated by the soul to life , then they think that &apos;s what the soul would be like , not like the soul , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
and by this soul , you think that they somehow sort of <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , present .
and if this <unk> then comes over the people , then he &apos;s filled with it , with a spirit , with nature , with nature , just with a soul , right now .
and then he can just <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to be coming from the outside .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that is really important to your life .
and if you look at these <unk> , you understand the logic that &apos;s been able to do this fortune through a lie through a lie to a lie .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> is still , you know .
so this is a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here &apos;s what you need to be logic , but also the willingness to lie .
and so to lie , they &apos;re just going to be able to be able to be able to be wrong .
in this case , three sentences are going to be three sentences .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , it &apos;s got a soul , then it &apos;s not .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;m particularly blown him up here .
so a third sentence that immediately stands to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the people who have no soul , who is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and you feel this .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you can see it immediately .
the first sentences , which are logical , are you logical .
i can say anything .
the analytics don &apos;t have a clue about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the analytics don &apos;t make it matter what is going to happen .
i can say anything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just going to be .
so if <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , when he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are obvious correct .
and now our <unk> awareness immediately immediately can do it .
it depends on a third sentence that &apos;s not having nothing to do with the first two sentences and it &apos;s what &apos;s the opposite of the first sentence and <unk> .
because in fact , we have to prove it to be the soul or not .
but with the logic that it &apos;s using , two sentences are correct , and a third <unk> that looks like it &apos;s like to do something with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we pretend that it &apos;s not impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue to continue these things on different examples .
in the present time , we have a very modern example , which is the <unk> <unk> .
and this is about another <unk> issue , a <unk> of philosophy , present to present .
this is what we &apos;re going to do with the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was called johannes <unk> and after that is called <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of pure nature .
and this is not that soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you put that right in the middle of the middle of two <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a matter to go to first .
so he stands right in the middle .
so the <unk> are introduced .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so only if you take another example , if you immediately get a big score , it doesn &apos;t need any sense , and it doesn &apos;t seem to be a sense of no sense .
automatically is going to be a real idea .
so if you have that idea that you &apos;re sort of driven in nature , you will be <unk> , by the larger pile that you wear , you know , you &apos;re very much , you know , you &apos;re going to feel like a free will .
and if we &apos;re in <unk> , i think we &apos;re at the <unk> of brain in the <unk> .
there is a <unk> , called wolf <unk> , and you can tell him , wolf , wolf claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now , we can make the second set of people to say , if the wolf has <unk> right , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re now able to read almost daily daily is that they &apos;re going to be in this third sentence .
it looks like that who doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , can &apos;t be pulled into action and claims to responsibility , and he &apos;s therefore <unk> .
you can also have it again .
so , you know , you have to prove it to you , whether it &apos;s like a <unk> .
but the logic of deception is allowing us to pretend the first sentence of first was wrong , and you had to take the opposite of the first one without evidence .
and now they can just want to do anything if you want to test anything , if you want to test anything , and particularly when you want people to make them happy , these audacity to keep the <unk> .
so for instance , for instance , if you look for a human being , you can &apos;t have a <unk> .
and i don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , who is called the prophets .
you can &apos;t call this , that would be a little political <unk> .
tell , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you &apos;ll be able to have a , for the course of the time , experience that you cannot prove .
and you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy working , it doesn &apos;t make you prove there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he was <unk> .
because he has led them to a <unk> <unk> that he doesn &apos;t even slow himself down at himself .
because in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in that need to prove himself to prove himself to prove that there &apos;s a <unk> .
so , in the way , in the way the <unk> is experience , they &apos;re the fake theory of the lie .
and once again , once again , this <unk> of people have to feel these people , do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they remember they &apos;re not going to remember their <unk> .
thank you very much for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed to ask myself , i asked myself to mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and i asked myself if i &apos;m here , i &apos;m giving you a lecture and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , i &apos;ve been hard to talk to my idea at first .
and i may probably imagine my favorite <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s all the sum up , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the two girls who are there , probably one of the generation that &apos;s made for this bad measurement , because i &apos;ve been <unk> , engineering , college college , i think i think i think , you know , <unk> , <unk> college , today , i think , you know , <unk> .
and i went to berlin , and i was in berlin <unk> because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that was not in the <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the first thing was all the <unk> , even the <unk> was called <unk> .
the hot <unk> today .
because a good engineer has made a great car or <unk> .
but something like <unk> , like the n <unk> , made out of a hundred watts of the square meter that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful to <unk> that he &apos;s a word again , because after the <unk> , you couldn &apos;t use the word until the word &quot; -- everything left was bad .
but in the 1920s , it wasn &apos;t like this in the <unk> years .
there was so so that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in the <unk> where you knew evil .
the point of the <unk> , but it was meant <unk> and <unk> and solar power , and i started walking around the <unk> .
and yeah , a lot of what was said to me is , i &apos;m very , because many , many beautiful expressions were , i &apos;ve lived through .
i was working in the <unk> of the <unk> , which was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one was said , the <unk> was the <unk> , which has a totally <unk> for 10 years , if i was a great <unk> , i might actually <unk> my very <unk> &apos;s guild , because all colleagues of my father &apos;s always <unk> , you have the money to the windows in your child .
it &apos;s going to work with insanity .
and that was very , very , very , very <unk> and then you get into this sort of big phase , and i &apos;ve been asked , and i &apos;ve been asked , a little image of the <unk> , a thousand <unk> , which is at the time , of course , the <unk> , <unk> , is that the great thing to be .
and i got off to <unk> <unk> and then we have become <unk> of my company , i became <unk> of the company that became <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s largest microfinance <unk> of the world &apos;s largest microfinance microfinance .
a <unk> , but we have , of course , we have a problem of a growing enterprise and we have <unk> , a small group of companies that are heading again , and we think , and we think about the next topic of the future , and that is a little crazy topic that &apos;s starting to be <unk> .
and i brought you a project that i brought to you now .
and the title of the presentation was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where could you use a memory of money today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
and there &apos;s a couple of four and a half thousand people .
they today have an average income today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> each other , the system begins to fail .
and i always tell you the politicians , if you &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
so they always say why ?
we &apos;ve heard about 20 percent in germany .
but there &apos;s no problem .
but right now , we &apos;re seven percent of the time , and our net is physically , the european european .
if we had a 20 percent of europe , we have already had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , the first thing was , the first <unk> , the first <unk> of the island , and just not just the one .
how big would be , because it &apos;s a battery that you have to be a battery , you know , an island of 20 , 30 , 50 , maybe 70 percent of the <unk> .
and yeah , i go again a more <unk> .
the conventional system looks like the world &apos;s the way .
by the way , a year , a hundred <unk> of an electric performance is to <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the world .
that &apos;s what &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world that &apos;s going to be erased with the <unk> because you &apos;re not allowed to be a permit .
that &apos;s pretty fast .
you put it in a nice box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the <unk> are always waiting for two to be two .
yeah , so this is the last thing that &apos;s the burden .
we also have very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system that can only be <unk> in small amounts of <unk> .
our goal was to say , &quot; okay , &quot;
the harvest is <unk> and the wind , the sun uses the burden that you can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go through 20 percent renewables , more energy per year , it &apos;s not the power of energy , not the power of the time , they need to turn the sands off .
that is , in the moment , she &apos;s got to worry that renewables can be able to take the entire web to the entire web .
and of course , they can only be <unk> by any way they &apos;re being made by this .
this is no one in the world &apos;s making .
so that &apos;s a little bit of scale , so you can use your car to your <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
people always ask me , what kind of life do you want to do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to <unk> several of these <unk> , and you &apos;re supposed to build a network , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 percent of the three percent , and then still , this rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very costly , and it &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re going to work out of batteries .
this is going to be a <unk> , which is that hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it &apos;s going to be , that &apos;s going to be .
they need to go to a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what is , with a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far comes from ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulation .
and wind and sun and the load of the load and the <unk> , and then the result , an very exciting outcome of the conventional system , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that was the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
is great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if the average five percent is rising up .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would do anything to do ?
have <unk> with investors , i looked for new <unk> .
we were at the time that we were just five people to rebuild the society .
and here again , the plot .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that &apos;s our system also , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent of the system that we &apos;re doing is now , and a <unk> percent , and not <unk> the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> on the island has meant that we &apos;re all going to great .
but also , we also support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we could sort of actually map the electric <unk> at the scale of one of the island to three very large .
that means we looked at first , the largest battery in the world &apos;s largest battery .
here you are .
they &apos;re naturally naturally naturally in asia .
and <unk> is they <unk> in the &apos; 70s , <unk> <unk> , and then we created <unk> , and then they became <unk> of the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very , very large battery .
it &apos;s got a solar performance , and can put it in a <unk> , and it &apos;s the battery that we have to have <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up .
and we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he stands there , in the hall , to actually actually , the whole dynamic behavior of the web , so it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s the <unk> of the sun , and you &apos;re the entire <unk> .
over here , we simulate the whole <unk> of the cable factory , the <unk> of the cable to manifest the <unk> in the web .
and you can see this whole thing .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the web .
here we see this again again again , again , again , again , all the time , individual <unk> .
and what we did was , since <unk> , the <unk> was finished , until today , is basically anything like this to develop the individual operating system in electronics , software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re redefining , but we define as a company that &apos;s just between the subject battery and the theme of the web , and everything in between .
you need to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate to the <unk> , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is that you &apos;re actually doing this in this island , basically , the <unk> of the field , is the <unk> of the problems we &apos;re going to get to do when we want to increase our percentage of renewable .
so this whole discussion , how will turn back to the moment and <unk> , <unk> , like this , in the island , we have to have 30 percent of the wind to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> offers a <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start to integrate <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , can you get the burden .
that means if you &apos;re an <unk> percent , you can &apos;t do that without any of the memory .
you can <unk> by the n , you can get the nets , yes , you should do it , you should be doing , you know , you can &apos;t get rid of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s the one thing that &apos;s the message .
so many people come and look at that there , because you can see , you can see what &apos;s going to get problems .
if we turn the sands , you don &apos;t have a little bit of the same time that causes a certain column in the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just a lot of <unk> masses of large <unk> , where the wave is all around europe , and the wave of the wave is rotating around the world .
we &apos;re looking into this web , you see the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to start a few <unk> <unk> , then a little <unk> of steam engine , then we &apos;ll get back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you &apos;re going to <unk> it , it takes a long time .
the <unk> <unk> has to be about 10 seconds to keep the net stable stable .
and in time , they can respond to another .
if you haven &apos;t have that spinning , these spinning mass , then you have to replace that with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can actually <unk> this big battery two milliseconds .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> there &apos;s going to be there .
and the message is , we need to get rid of these <unk> of the magnitude of the things , if we like , our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 30 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach the right ?
and then we have to break our <unk> capacity to the net .
<unk> is just saying , the power plant goes with , to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> moment in the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or not , because that &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make a decision that you can , the capacity to break down the <unk> capacity , break back into a <unk> of the grid .
and there are now luckily for now a whole bunch of studies .
and then the purpose of people come and look at the people , and look at our <unk> , like our <unk> .
and i think the discussion is always about the question , how far can you move there a piece of a future .
and many discussions i &apos;ve had in the last six years , like the discussion that i had in the last 30 years , the subject of <unk> .
don &apos;t go , &quot; there &apos;s no way , we &apos;ve done everything we &apos;ve never been out of , never , ever .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to take out that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity for <unk> the same capacity for the world .
it &apos;s just going to happen .
there &apos;s a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve been experienced now in the last two years , that the scientists are going to be put on my side .
we have now gotten over 10 million <unk> , even around the german net now , right now to the german web .
this is going to take place in the next april .
so , you know , you also see that there is a change that &apos;s there and only that <unk> is to be a hundred percent renewable right now .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , i &apos;ve always been trying to do these <unk> , these <unk> , which have a own <unk> web , which is not to do with our <unk> .
the question is , but it &apos;s just very easy to make a independent <unk> or <unk> <unk> , who will be <unk> somewhere in the world , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , they &apos;re an island .
then they &apos;re just going to consume what &apos;s in the sun and wind up where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy and i &apos;m grateful to have a grateful power of the sun .
and that &apos;s what we do , and this is what we &apos;re going to do , and the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can again be a <unk> , and you can use it a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to encourage you just to be a little bit of being a little bit of being a little bit of being crazy and also a vision .
and you really have to stay quite <unk> , but i think that it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
as steve lopez , new york , new times the streets of los angeles , he went to the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she was a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , homeless , who had just two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> paper , a book later , was <unk> , and robert kennedy was <unk> by robert <unk> , who was <unk> <unk> and jamie <unk> as a german <unk> , and his lifelong career <unk> .
nathaniel left , suffered a <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of <unk> row in the middle of los angeles .
i recommend reading all of you , reading book , and to watch the movie , so it &apos;s not just the wonderful connectedness that came between those two men , but how the music helped make these connection and how to make the music that is going to get the case , <unk> away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 two years ago , two years ago , in the walt disney , <unk> hall .
he was just a reflection of beethoven &apos;s first first ever symphony and the fourth symphony came to imagine to imagine .
he was talking in a very <unk> and <unk> sound of yo-yo pitt and his <unk> clinton and how the dodgers would never get into the baseball world , and this is because it &apos;s been the <unk> in the last sentence of <unk> .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email that was in the state that was the nathaniel for me to find out of interest in my interest .
i have to mention that nathaniel had been <unk> medical treatment because it was already using electric gas and <unk> and treated a trauma that has been <unk> his entire life .
now , as a consequence , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable for these schizophrenic periods , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he would go for days , and he &apos;s subjected to the horror of his own spirit , always the horror and the <unk> of his own spirit .
and in exactly the way , nathaniel was in the <unk> , when we were in the first grade of class , the first grade was <unk> hall , and he was completely lost this <unk> in his eyes and she was very lost .
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke and he was a <unk> in the sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was scared i could lose him that he could lose him in his own <unk> , and that i could get to relieve him his relationship to the highlight of the <unk> and <unk> and other exciting forms of the <unk> .
so i started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was playing , i realized that in <unk> , a complete change in front of her .
it was like , as if he was a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose was my game was the game .
<unk> <unk> anger , in understanding , in a calm curiosity and a way .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and i started to play , i &apos;d like to hear some snippets of <unk> <unk> , and i asked them to finish them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , starting from bach , and <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he &apos;s not only a <unk> knowledge about music , but it also connected her to a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;m just in the <unk> of los angeles of <unk> .
by using music , and he talked about music , he was from this <unk> , confused man who had moved through the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , fine musicians , in <unk> .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music is music .
because the music allows him to allow him to do his thoughts and the <unk> with the imagination and creativity in a real <unk> .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that &apos;s the nature of art .
right now , why is the reason we make music : so we &apos;re something that we &apos;re all in all of us , deep inside of our emotions , our emotions , through our creativity , through our creativity .
and the reality of that expression is , all of us , inspired and move , and we bring it together .
what nathaniel did , he brought it back to the music , and it took him back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force took him back into a family of musicians who understood his mind that he knows his talent and he <unk> him .
and i &apos;m going to talk to acute music , whether to the walt disney , <unk> hall or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i stole the <unk> .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fishes in my life .
i only loved two two .
this first , that was more like an romantic kind of .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> .
what a fish .
another better , he was getting in <unk> , after the best largest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that they &apos;re going to sell it .
i had this beauty with several months of a couple of months .
one day , the ceo rang the company , and i asked if i could give you one event about the <unk> .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this sort of thing was supposed to be chefs on the chefs . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans <unk> how we &apos;ve gotten the forests bare .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas that we love , the tunas that the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , i think , surely , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
many arguments , it &apos;s about , <unk> pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re going to take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are required to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company that tries to make it right .
i wanted to supported her .
the day before the event , i phoned the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call it a don &apos;t call it .
&quot; don &apos;t i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for the fact that you &apos;re in the sea to grow out of the sea , that you don &apos;t <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of the fish being distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added to it , &quot; we &apos;re basically a different world .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> one , great .
&quot; <unk> &apos;s one what ? what does it do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that evening , i lay in bed , and what &apos;s the hell of hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i phoned the next day , right before the event , don &apos;t know .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what &apos;s about sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll be a few .
well , i &apos;m <unk> with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer . until i finally finally <unk> my senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it a lot of that .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what &apos;s the kind of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , you know , <unk> , skin , snake <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what &apos;s a matter of chicken to feed fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> by this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually <unk> <unk> from this fish because i swear in god , the fish that &apos;s <unk> after that conversation after that .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you &apos;re going to be able to know better you are you &apos;re learning your fish , you know the fish that you &apos;re talking about .
i ate it first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talked about a fish .
it &apos;s a bit of <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright , almost <unk> white paint .
the chef had him <unk> .
stop twice .
amazingly , he was still <unk> .
who can make a fish so well , after he &apos;s got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
call it <unk> . actually , it &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t have the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way you get and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s had the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> on what they were essentially wetlands .
they made this up by raising the land .
they built this complicated product of channels , and they kept tearing out water from the land and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it , it was not economic .
and it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to see what the ground is for that place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company would bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of the water pump , they used the water for the water to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a <unk> 60 hectare of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and the <unk> , and his company <unk> the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you haven &apos;t seen anything like this .
it looks out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and these density , the <unk> march .
i wasn &apos;t a long time at a time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles and a part of the <unk> , &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
okay ? so we were taking us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
here he takes a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he looks a pattern of <unk> , which reminds him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> is the largest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a <unk> of this .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and fall down , and then you fall down and <unk> <unk> of rare birds and weird .
and don &apos;t understand me wrong , which was fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , in the way that kind of art .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i interrupted . i said , &quot; <unk> , how is it that your fish is miserable ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what food is ?
what is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s continued to tell me that it &apos;s a very rich system that &apos;s eating the fish , which they eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
ever heard a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
and i was walking around the site on this site , and i was walking around the site with a <unk> , and i asked him , &quot; to a place that &apos;s like to be , &quot; how do you do success ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a film player would have an insurance officer .
and we <unk> the corner , and we provided the most incredible sight of sight , thousands and thousands of dylan , a literally guitar carpet that &apos;s been able to be able to be the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at her <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well last year , on this site , 600,000 birds were more than a 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest thing that &apos;s become the biggest of the most important private equity in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> isn &apos;t the last thing you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the <unk> the belly the system better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s <unk> that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures your success to the health of their hometown .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> doesn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city of a city , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning you fly to the farm of a farm .
and every night they &apos;re flying there , they fly back .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line from the <unk> of the <unk> .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at the <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , flies fly 240 miles to the farm and fly it back to the evening ?
do you make that kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as i was a song of whitney , houston , <unk> .
he said , &quot; no . you do this because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , who was <unk> , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like them .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m not going to cook .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t tasted <unk> .
she liked sweet and in it , as if you take a bite from the sea .
i mentioned that to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense of the front , before something inside the body .
she &apos;s evolved in evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added to , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her fish -- a farm that affects your success of your hometown .
and then i realized when he says a farm that has no <unk> , <unk> it , because the water goes through this farm is flowing from this farm from the river in the stream .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that rivers tend to have , and they tend to lead , chemical pollutants , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and if it was fought by the system , and this leaves is the water cleaner , as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only a farm that &apos;s driving their success to the health of their hometown , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but for you .
because if the water <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i should do it , because this love , as whatever , is <unk> , too .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good foods , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the foods , in the foods , taste of food .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit of radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that these things are the things that the future of good food is somebody stands up and says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re making enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding more than just .
a billion people are starving .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the <unk> inequities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;re the logic of our <unk> for the last 50 years .
<unk> grain of herbivores , <unk> on <unk> , <unk> chemicals on earth , chicken , and all the time that the limitation is , &quot; if we &apos;re eating more people &apos;s cheaper , how bad is that ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the easy thing . it was the business plan of the u.s. agriculture .
we should call them a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , which is very <unk> , <unk> capital of capital that allows this to be .
this is not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our dental <unk> is endangered because of <unk> <unk> , but because of the <unk> resource , we &apos;re going to have the resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile land , not by <unk> land , not by <unk> water , not by <unk> , but by forest , not by <unk> and nets , but by fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are able to feed each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital capital , chemistry and machines are sitting in it , and it never really made a really good good to eat .
so let &apos;s take the ecological model .
this is that the two billion years of <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses , who are not the worlds for these businesses , and the <unk> , <unk> , businesses , the <unk> , are not <unk> , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts in flavor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s me right , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to share with you today is the whole thing that we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts of the parts and rather than thinking about the <unk> of their parts and then , i want to think that they &apos;re going to be able to think about how we can &apos;t be visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> of age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter to a certain death of death , let &apos;s say accidents .
and instantly , i see another pattern that makes it happen .
because that &apos;s because in the <unk> there are the people who are the active and they &apos;re over the <unk> .
we can step up one step further and line the data and see that the data and the usual suspects are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
if we go on further and more , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or we &apos;re seeing the <unk> of the people that are even the agents of the people who should make people worry .
and who &apos;s <unk> , that &apos;s true of men &apos;s true .
so you see that the vision of information and data is in the same way in the <unk> in a living <unk> .
and if we can do this for data , why not the content is for the content ?
so what we &apos;re here is the <unk> of each single &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; the <unk> .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my <unk> in their <unk> .
and with <unk> , they can dive in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this issue and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;ll leave this , i &apos;ll just show up to me all the time , &quot; armstrong will be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i go back to step back and <unk> the lens .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you &apos;re going on this sort of information , <unk> , wider , <unk> , <unk> , don &apos;t just want to be just not just for or not just not .
you do something that is a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between the between and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit with something a little bit about what a little crazy thing is .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> and <unk> them on a little summary .
so the summary of the summary is a little bit of <unk> and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just show the top 500 of the <unk> .
but even in that <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an idea about the issues that are the ones who are at the lowest time .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of the government .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen the government , i know that the <unk> <unk> most people are at the time of the year , people of the year .
this is really important because this is a insight that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to recognize if you take a step back , and you look at the whole thing .
so , looking at a particular of these summaries , i can go back to the subject of time , &quot; people of the year &quot; people go in .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of these are <unk> . some people come from science , some of the time , are , you know , less , come from the economy .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s bono &apos;s winner winner .
so we can now jump back and take a look at all ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re browsing on the web as it &apos;s actually a net , not just to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else would show you a little bit .
i just show you the new york times website .
<unk> , these app -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see websites at all , and we bring these <unk> to each one website like this .
so i can step back to a step , and right to a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you just look at how much websites in this way , and look at all the way that you can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in my course in a certain time .
here &apos;s the one of the demonstration that i was held to this way .
and i can sort of see anything i &apos;ve looked at , again , again .
and , if i take a step up , i can look at everything , i can go through everything i <unk> , maybe i can go through my <unk> , and here i &apos;m looking for <unk> , or here &apos;s a live online labs .
and from here , i can go to the side and you go back to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to use , and every time it makes the big picture bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the moment , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet to the head , so that we &apos;re always going to go from one to another , starting from many things to make a lot of things that were left out of the hidden , and see patterns that were left hidden ?
if we can do this , then this is going to <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just move into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , we can actually <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my high school , i was driving at the bus school , every day a day .
and my nose always had always been in a book , a <unk> that was involved in other worlds , and in my <unk> way , my deep <unk> of <unk> , and my deep curiosity <unk> .
and this curiosity also showed that i always had , if i was not at school , and walked and <unk> , and <unk> , frogs and <unk> and <unk> , everything took home and under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible explore .
and my love science fiction , in my setting , it seemed to be mirror in my environment , because in the late 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his amazing shows that animals and places that showed us to be a world of wonder that we could never imagined .
so , this is all good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video games that video games still had these <unk> of the <unk> of the media media , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all had to do all the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and put it on the canvas in our heads .
my reaction was drawing and painting by alien aliens , and the <unk> worlds , robots , and all the things .
in the <unk> , i was constantly getting caught by the teacher , i hid in the textbook , hidden textbook .
creativity had to come out .
and something interesting happened . what was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our planet .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;d never be an alien world to achieve a spaceship . that seemed to be quite unlikely .
but here was a world i could actually walk in , here on earth , and she was as fascinating as i was in the same as a kind of exotic and as i had been imagined as i &apos;ve been described .
so i decided to be a little diver , <unk> .
the only problem was that i lived in a little village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t give them a <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , found , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> <unk> in a pool of <unk> in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face the face two years later when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , the last year , i &apos;ve spent about three thousand hours underwater , and i spent about three hours of water .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , is the rich in <unk> life , as we really can really possibly imagine .
the <unk> of nature doesn &apos;t know frontiers , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
so far days i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love to the ocean , with the same intensity , and the same intensity as ever .
when i was an adult profession , it was the filmmaking .
it seemed to be the best way to tell you , to tell stories , to create the paintings , to build images .
as a kid , i drew comic books and so .
so movies were the way movies to bring images and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m <unk> , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and i could , &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could put my <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> .
so , basically my two loves .
something interesting happened at the time , to solve a problem in this film -- and we had to create a sort of liquid problem in this film -- we had to get a sort of liquid <unk> -- we &apos;d <unk> <unk> animation , <unk> , <unk> .
and what came out was the first <unk> <unk> ever to see in a film .
and the film doesn &apos;t make any money in the same thing that was actually played , just as i was able to do his costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience all around the world was the <unk> of it .
according to arthur arthur clarke , we &apos;re actually known to distinguish technology and magic to make no more apart from each other .
so you saw something magic .
and i found that tremendously exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is what needs to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even more on .
together with <unk> , we made the guy out of liquid metal . the success depended on the way that this effect would get to be .
and it worked . again , we had created something , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money on the audience , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money .
from those two experiences , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend of mine , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . it was called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was that we could talk to a little bit of <unk> processes with visual printers and then start playing with the same time with digital <unk> .
and we did that , and we did a <unk> for a while .
but the middle &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we did was actually created the company -- too slow .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the <unk> <unk> of visual effects and <unk> effects in new heights , with the <unk> human , <unk> characters that were supposed to be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar pushed quite nice . and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to do the <unk> .
so i shifted that , and i made this sort of film about the big ship that goes .
the <unk> i have , as i sold it as &quot; romeo and julia , &quot; it became a <unk> <unk> of magnitude , a passionate film .
but secretly , i wanted to <unk> the real estate .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i persuaded them to be , i &apos;m going to go , &quot; we diving to the wreckage . we &apos;re film that we &apos;re all open .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the film .
that &apos;s tremendously important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to it again that can create your imagination .
and then we created a reality six months later , in which i made a <unk> <unk> <unk> , four miles underneath the north atlantic , and i looked at the actual titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that &apos;s really blown me .
and the way that they were doing is that we had to do it , and we had to make cameras and <unk> and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> more efficient .
you go up into this capsule , you &apos;re going to be in this dark , <unk> environment , where you can &apos;t get hope to rescue it , if you can &apos;t make it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s exactly like i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was very obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part of the curiosity and science has been done . it was all . it was curiosity , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me a hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a character that could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i hadn &apos;t seen before , sometimes , sometimes none had ever been before , and the science at the time we saw them had no words .
so that &apos;s really <unk> me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met an actual kind of an unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker on hollywood on ice and let &apos;s <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we were diving to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and we were exploring them with <unk> .
we went back to the wreckage for the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which we had a <unk> <unk> .
our purpose was to <unk> , and to watch the inside of the ship , which was never before before .
nobody ever explored the inside of the <unk> , and you didn &apos;t have a means of that . so we developed the technology .
so , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see , the <unk> , and i see that these <unk> are quite similar and i know that once the band is played there .
and i fly a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i &apos;m just <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was to give you physically physically , the titanic &apos;s the titanic .
that was the most <unk> form of a <unk> that i ever experienced , because before i take a <unk> , i always knew what the same was going to be in the vehicle of the vehicle , because i went to <unk> the film .
and the set was a precise copy of the design of the ship &apos;s the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me realize this <unk> , that you use such <unk> <unk> , and so that &apos;s your own consciousness in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little bit of a glimpse that might happen in some decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> , which i can imagine as a <unk> .
after this expeditions , we started to really appreciate what we saw there , actually appreciate the <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . that &apos;s like aliens aliens , but there &apos;s a aliens aliens , but on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a way of the system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees celsius that they can survive .
at the same time , i was interested in the same time , and i was very much for <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and nasa &apos;s <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they go to russia , through russia , through the mission of mission , all the mission of the mission , and then you fly the international <unk> and take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but the end was that i ran out that i took a <unk> with us in the deep sea .
i took them to the world and <unk> them to the world , there &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of the extreme situations and the <unk> , and so on the way they could test and <unk> and <unk> .
we did living in the <unk> , but actually , in fact , science is actually said , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , at the time , when the kid was a child , and the implementation in the reality .
and over the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m now thinking , surely , you can also have to have a director , a guide , or a guide , or so .
but i didn &apos;t mind a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what does it come out ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t give us cash .
we &apos;re just going to play the cost . and by the absence of glory .
everyone thinking i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; <unk> and would have made me somewhere in a <unk> towel on a tray .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these books , for a very small audience .
no credit , no credit , no money . what do you do ?
you do it for the problem , to the challenge , to the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there are . you &apos;re doing it because of the weird connection that comes together , and because of the weird connection that &apos;s created when a small group of people forming a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked on for years , and sometimes we were two to a two to three months in a row in a row .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the probability of each other , because you have a problem , you can &apos;t explain one other way .
if you go back to shore , &quot; we had to do it , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the difficulty , the people , the people , and the people , you can just tell you , that &apos;s how police officers have gone through , and you know , you can &apos;t tell you a little bit .
there &apos;s a connection , a respectful respect .
so when i came back to the next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same kind of leadership , namely that you &apos;re respected , respected , in return to return to the return .
and this is what the dynamics really became .
so , i stood again with a little team on <unk> terrain , and we did &quot; avatar &quot; &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that haven &apos;t been there .
so , very exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were having a <unk> for a hundred and a half years .
so , in effect , my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who thought we had these <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re going to transport on the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , and the real process that changed the results .
so what can we do all of the end ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think , first , i think , is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can create one reality .
and the kind of <unk> of your teams is more important than any of the world &apos;s <unk> .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice to me how i can do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you get a <unk> .
it &apos;s got some other people . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t you take yourself . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the arts and research , we need to be an alternative , because there will be a <unk> .
no major effort , the innovation demanded , the innovation demanded , has been pushed without risk .
you need to be ready to take risks .
that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way , and failure is an alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise something because my business model is basically about vaccines and seed , to do things , to make the things that we need to make and deliver the poorest 2 billion to allow you to make a better life .
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people , actually , even more important than anyone on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow a lot of years , because it &apos;s too much rain , and things are going to change how it can &apos;t withstand the fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to a <unk> .
so , a climate change is terrible for you .
and the <unk> is the <unk> for them very important .
the fact is that if you could reduce only one thing to the price , energy would be energy by far , the most effective thing .
well , the <unk> is like the time .
in fact , the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> the industrial revolution in the twentieth century , and even in the twentieth century , there &apos;s a <unk> case , and therefore we can <unk> modern materials , and so many things are doing so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation in the world with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s take the price of half , we &apos;re going to make a new barrier and the barrier of the <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> with co2 .
co2 is the planets and the equation for co2 is quite clear .
they &apos;re <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and these <unk> have a few negative effects , and perhaps worse , the <unk> follow that natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust the natural ecosystems to make these kinds of systems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are , there are some of those things , but not very much , but not very many .
and there &apos;s safe ambiguity that will be <unk> these consequences , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; you really have to get down to a little bit of a zero ?
isn &apos;t you enough one to half a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero zero , the temperature will continue to move .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we &apos;ve got a <unk> foot high truck that has to be a <unk> of a <unk> bridge , and you can just put it back up underneath the <unk> .
this is all right down to the bottom , at zero .
well , we &apos;re running a lot of carbon dioxide , over the <unk> billion tons of tons .
every americans about 20 tons of tons of people , less than one of poor countries , less than one .
and the average is about five tons of every one on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that one of the things that &apos;s going to get down to zero .
it &apos;s all constant .
just different economic changes , it &apos;s affected by all , and we need to go to <unk> increase in the end , and to zero per capita .
this equation has four factors : a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a time -- co2 -- that &apos;s co2 -- it &apos;s going to take you to a number of people , from the <unk> , which is using the number of people in the average , which is the equivalent of the <unk> energy for every service of the time .
so let &apos;s see each other factor of looking at a point and think about how we get it at zero .
probably one of those numbers has to be very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it &apos;s going to take on to the nine billion of <unk> that move on to the nine billion .
if we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we &apos;re going to see 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the services we &apos;re using .
this includes all the foods that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> , these services almost to make it available to the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the wealthy world , in the upper world , we could probably make a <unk> and less use , but in average , that number one year and more of the time that is going to be more than the <unk> of the services that are being supported by the one of the services that &apos;s going to be given a person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . there &apos;s a very basic service to the light that you can read your homework ?
and these students don &apos;t , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the e , the power per service , is there .
we have something that &apos;s not going to grow up .
because of course , different successes of the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new ways in the <unk> , there are a lot of services to reduce their energy in the energy group of the people to reduce 90 percent of them .
in other service , like the manufacturing product , 105 degrees of <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement , a lot of times .
all of the time we &apos;re optimistic , we might be a factor of a factor of a factor of three or maybe one factor six or maybe one factor .
but the first three factors , we &apos;re now about <unk> billion of <unk> , and they &apos;re just not going to be just for me .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be a <unk> unit of energy per unit of energy .
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get that at zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every <unk> of electricity are co2 , but renewables are the renewables and the renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; miracle , i &apos;m not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there is no time you need a miracle to a miracle to a particular date .
usually you may be about the next and some people , others don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered how can i really get this to the other ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s supposed to be on this ?
i remember last year when i gave mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really tangible , you know , you know , there &apos;s people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here .
i decided that the <unk> of the trees that would be my <unk> &apos;s contribution to the environment .
so here are a couple of natural fireflies fireflies are .
i mean , you know , you didn &apos;t bite them . in fact , you don &apos;t even get the glass of left .
now , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> like this , but they all don &apos;t do much .
we need solutions , either one or several of them have a range of scale and a whole range of having a whole range of having a lot of the people that people are looking for , i really see five , which can be able to afford these big .
i have the tides , <unk> , fusion and <unk> .
and this may be a <unk> contribution , and if you do better , that would be nice , but my message here is that we need to work on all of those five work , and we can &apos;t give them up because they &apos;re excited because they &apos;re excited because they &apos;re excited .
so let &apos;s take off the burning fossil fuels , burning of the coal , burning of coal or natural gas .
what you need to do is , maybe easy , but it &apos;s not . you gotta do all the co2 that &apos;s going to come from the burning of the <unk> , capture under pressure , and then you can see it &apos;s there .
there are some <unk> that creates 60 percent of the time -- 80 percent of the time , but it &apos;s going to be very hard to get a lot of it , and a consequence for the ingredient to make the carbon of the co2 is a big challenge .
who &apos;s going to make sure ?
who can do something that literally a lot of billions of waste are larger than any kind of garbage that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a hard thing .
next : <unk> .
and the cost of the big big problems , the cost of everything in <unk> countries are high . the question of certainty , that you really feel that nothing wrong , despite the human fulfillment that &apos;s not being used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very hard problems that might be solvable , and that &apos;s where you should work .
the last three of five , i put in .
it &apos;s renewable energy , as they &apos;re a lot of them .
and also , although it &apos;s great -- they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is the energy density that these technologies are dramatically less than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 more land than a normal power station .
also , <unk> <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be a whole day and the wind , and the wind doesn &apos;t always get the flow of the wind .
so you have to be dependent on this sources , you have to have a way that energy is in times when they &apos;re not available to get it .
so there &apos;s great <unk> . there &apos;s challenges in the transmission of the transmission , and if we say , the power source is because the energy is , they need to deal with the risk of the energy that &apos;s going on in the risk of different things .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all made all kinds of batteries , looking for cars , computers , mobile phones , <unk> , for everything . and that &apos;s what i used to do with the amount of electronic energy that the world is using the world .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the way that we &apos;re going to get back at the time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this happens when you try to do these <unk> sources of the <unk> sources of people , we &apos;re 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to rely on 100 percent of it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five spaces we need to have 100 people .
so many are you going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of us here in the ted group that are already engaged .
bill &apos;s big has thousands of companies including one called the great <unk> of the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> investment in dozens of companies making fun things and interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i fund a company that &apos;s a company , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there &apos;s some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
so the development has stopped at this industry in a few days , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
so the <unk> means that you &apos;re on a part of the <unk> , which one percent , the <unk> , decided that we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
that &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never simulate <unk> , whether it &apos;s going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you see , yeah , yeah , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and because you burn that 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better than it is much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of today reactors as a <unk> .
instead of breaking the head , you &apos;ll just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium &apos;s used to grow gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of a column , often than &quot; the &quot; kind of wave of the kind of wave . &quot;
this is really the <unk> .
here is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that 99 percent , you have the part that &apos;s burned to be cut down now , so it &apos;s <unk> uranium .
the <unk> center for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> and just <unk> , you get enough propellant on the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s a couple of hundreds of thousands of concepts that we need to move forward to move forward .
now think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the destination that we need to do , and then we &apos;re going to talk about the <unk> .
many of the 80 percent of a 80 percent reduction is to 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are being created in poor countries , and still something agriculture , and hopefully it will be clean and cement to get clean .
so to reach that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> , their <unk> .
the other note is , whether we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is a key key to this <unk> .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 be looking ?
it should have been the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to bring to the way , the less we <unk> , the less we will be , the less likely to be the <unk> and the temperature .
but actually , the note is that the things that we do not fully are the big <unk> of <unk> , just right , or even slightly important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
this is the world we need to track <unk> and we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this subject .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> <unk> energy air , the air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going to be able to do it and create a framework where this is going on in the broad world , because we need to support for all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you only give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , you could choose the president , or i could choose , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , i would take a <unk> .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , it will be a <unk> between the long time in the time , in the way in the u.s. and china , between poor and china , between poor and rich , and almost all the lives of this 2 billion will be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do that ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk these <unk> , and they were shocked by the fact that they &apos;re supposed to be spent on the very <unk> of these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade <unk> &amp; amp ; trade <unk> .
we need to spread the news .
we need to have dialogue and full of the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to make more <unk> a little better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : the simulation of the simulation of a supercomputer , all of the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve tested a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s going to work .
the tricky step is that the first one is building the first <unk> , to find another billion , the place that actually build the first one of them .
once the first finished is , if he &apos;s promised , you know , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic growth is that energy density is so different than the <unk> of it , as we know them .
to understand that , that &apos;s a deep column to make it , as a vertical column , is to <unk> a vertical column , and then it &apos;s the process of the process , and then it starts to work on the bottom and then , on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . so , you &apos;ve got to <unk> the reactor &apos;s new reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of control that can go wrong , and this thing where you &apos;re open and do things that are not good !
but if you have a cheap fuel , you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of a column that you bury , without the whole kind of complexities .
and there &apos;s been there , and it &apos;s been <unk> for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , the self offers a solution to the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens with the crap : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less rubbish with this method -- then you take it into the next reactor and burn it into the next reactor and you will keep it on the next reactor .
and we &apos;re starting to take the waste of the waste that exists already , that &apos;s what &apos;s in these <unk> or <unk> . this is our <unk> .
so what &apos;s a problem of these reactors was a problem that we put in our interactions and it will reduce the <unk> dramatically in the process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world , you &apos;ve talked about these options .
where is the greatest interest , so what really do it ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t determined a place and we have a lot of interesting <unk> for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest , and people &apos;s interest in russia , india -- i was here , and i &apos;ve met the <unk> and talked the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have got something to do .
this is an alternative one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this built , so everyone &apos;s built a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea , time , time and probability of that really really ?
<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to make up and then for 20 years to use .
this is the very <unk> deadline that we have the <unk> of the <unk> we need to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if all you running , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could hold it easy .
and luckily , today , dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of , as they work , they work , they can work for the <unk> for their pilots to be able to swallow it .
and it would be best if it &apos;s been able to get multiple , because then you could use a blend .
so , we need a solution to every case .
does the big breakthroughs are the biggest breakthroughs you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would have been without the <unk> , but it &apos;s more important .
in the nuclear sector sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how to do this work as well as these , but there &apos;s the <unk> method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be a little bit of hard , but maybe that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about this is that a <unk> <unk> is a million times so much energy like one , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> and the costs , the power of the time , is the impact of the land and other things , almost in a league of <unk> .
if that doesn &apos;t happen , what happens ?
to do we need to use <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you come into that situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and a heart attack stands for a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is <unk> techniques , to delay warming , so that 20 or 30 years for us to get us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work at insurance because you &apos;re not <unk> , because you &apos;re eating , because you know , you know , you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if the problem is , if you &apos;re going to be the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you should have the things that come faster , or this innovation will need to be more faster than we expect .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences to convince you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are the skeptics in very different camps .
those are the scientific arguments , are very little .
do you say there is negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are going to move ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell you about that there are a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is like a lot like aids .
you make the mistake , and you pay a lot of them to pay for it much .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems , in something that you &apos;re doing in something that has done -- and then the investment is not so clear , and it &apos;s the ipcc report , and it &apos;s not the <unk> of the ipcc , and they say , well , this is not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us care .
but my dream here is that if you can do it as economic , and at the same time , the skeptics were going to say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter that it was not a co2 <unk> , i wish that it was that it was not a carbon , but i think it &apos;s cheaper than the previous way . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all of those time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals of the world are suffering , the <unk> , which is a <unk> waste of resource to invest in , while there &apos;s a <unk> waste of resource .
<unk> : well , the actual spending on research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should be 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not a dramatic .
and there are other things that don &apos;t suffer .
you then get big <unk> , and there &apos;s a sensible people disagree with , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and i tried to pay it , and i &apos;m going to pay for you most of the waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short before a <unk> and funded just learning the learning , and i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much less less .
if the <unk> <unk> you get , is a very high <unk> , just the rich .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times a lot of our energy , and not change in our lifestyle without changing .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more <unk> thinks .
now , his new <unk> is : &quot; why don &apos;t we have a research ? &quot;
it &apos;s still becoming yet , because of his former stories , with the <unk> <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s going to bring it back now .
and this is a revelation that i think is appropriate for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s going to support .
now , bill , i think i &apos;m talking to almost all people here , if i say , i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> is a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> to the biggest <unk> structure of the structure of the <unk> structure , about a foot tape , about a foot tape , and build a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
the marshmallow has got on it .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually hard because it &apos;s very hard because it &apos;s very quickly working .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> <unk> .
it was a great success .
since i was done , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops in the world with students , engineers and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> and what &apos;s been doing with you , what &apos;s profound is to share with you .
normally , most people start to orient themselves on the task of the task .
they talk about it , you think , what it looks like , they &apos;re <unk> around .
then you spend a little bit of planning in planning and organization . they draw and they &apos;re grabbing spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> constantly <unk> of the time .
and finally , just before you have no time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it back up to the top , you get a step back and you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
but then , almost always , is what happens to be , is that the <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is caused by the whole thing that could bend and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more <unk> , as others , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
they lie ; they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and make it really <unk> .
and of course , there are teams that have teams of <unk> , and they have <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s quite astonishing .
as peter , they don &apos;t just produce the tallest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how does that ? what ? what is that ?
and peter said , &quot; no of the kids in the words spend of the words of the words . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that <unk> was trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s a thing .
what happens when they put the marshmallow up on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different about the <unk> is that they start building the marshmallow and build prototypes , and always the <unk> , so they &apos;ve got a way to fix these kinds of <unk> prototypes .
<unk> is this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each other trial , the children will be immediate feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance , with a prototype , is considerably -- but we can see how different teams are acting .
the average average for most of the is about <unk> , <unk> , and the half of them , lawyers are more than more , more than adults are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
a little bit of a meter is the highest .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are key to build stable structures .
ceos are something about average , but here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
you &apos;ll be an <unk> administrator at the team , they &apos;re going to better significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , you can see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special capabilities of the <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and the team that &apos;s going to regulate and is the work of the <unk> , improving the way that we &apos;re going to improve .
and more of these are more important and <unk> and their combination .
if you have 10 teams that do the typical run , you get about six , you get a <unk> structure .
i was trying to do something .
i thought we &apos;ll bring the <unk> out of the same .
so i offered a $ <unk> prize for the winner for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had a <unk> building , he would have been a price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high <unk> have a powerful effect ?
we went through these exercise with the same students .
what do you think about ?
now they understand the advantage of the &quot; interactive . &quot;
so , the same thing that was done by the same is bad team of the best .
they produced the highest construction at the time .
so there &apos;s a <unk> lessons of us , about nature &apos;s nature and success .
you like , why would anyone actually invest in a <unk> basis ?
the reason is , i &apos;m using digital tools and creating processes to help teams , to help autos , the video games and the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> is , they &apos;re helping to identify the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a shared language or an ethos to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , you can go <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples from all around the world , how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is that the construction is actually a sport sport .
it requires that we all put our senses up to the task and we &apos;re using an optimal way of how our emotions and our ones , and our challenge , that &apos;s what we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to bring a <unk> .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do as we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and this is a time machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everyone in this room has got to go inside .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and stay here .
and i wonder what you would choose because i have asked my friends in many years , and they wanted to go all the time .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before the cars were , or twitter , &quot; america &apos;s search of idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re in a way to <unk> , to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an imaginary .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back to this planet , you go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that existed on the planet , whether you have the scale of them , health , wealth , wealth , opportunities , seasonal <unk> .
there never been a time of a time .
my <unk> died all the time you were 60 .
my grandparents are <unk> .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so , there was better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born in new delhi is expected to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox got more people on this planet .
they have a new <unk> of the earth &apos;s demographics , like no war ever .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we <unk> them . pop .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have been threatened by one generation , not even yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our capacity , to feed billions of people , these are the successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is a little bit of things to try and see if it &apos;s not going to change it , one of the great achievements of humankind .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all good news , because there are a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned in a lot of other things .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day , to go hungry .
that number up , and it &apos;s going to be very quick , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used to use our imagination to <unk> the world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , they &apos;re disappearing , and if we don &apos;t go out of that mess , and if we don &apos;t go out of that mess we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which is that we will feed the billions of people without the land they live in .
i think we can power this world with energy that they &apos;re not even destroying at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really no , and no , this is not a <unk> .
but this is me , at night , one of the things that you &apos;re awake at night , and i never need scientific progress , and we never need scientific progress .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it , we &apos;ve never been able to <unk> it .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back to this , 300 years ago , to find a time that we &apos;ve been struggling to fight for these things in which we have , in which we have gotten more powerful <unk> .
people are putting in their belief , and that &apos;s so tightly you can &apos;t free them .
not the truth will it gets it .
and listen , everyone has a very good thing to think about his opinion , even a right thing to advance .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have a right thing to do your own facts . &apos; &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t have .
and i needed a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about <unk> for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at the resistance of the resistance , to the resistance of what the most effective operation in the public health is in the history of mankind .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and i was going on .
and soon , i wrote an essay on genetically modified food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules on a particular rather than a random way of a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to get a , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me care , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and i ended up and i found it .
and that &apos;s because these undergraduates that are crazy , i didn &apos;t have the assistants to actually refuse .
these were <unk> people , intellectual people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that &apos;s what i got so disturbed me .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress like earlier .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about ironic that little quote that we &apos;re talking about , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reason , and i think we know what &apos;s the reason that are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of losing , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a couple names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed that they always have right . they &apos;re kind of skeptical .
ask yourself , demand , demand , demand .
don &apos;t take anything as granted .
but now , if you get evidence of the evidence you need to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can tell that , in the reason we &apos;re in an epidemic of fear , as i haven &apos;t seen it , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see them .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the <unk> of the minimum <unk> , <unk> , <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
in fact , in many trials , they were done to see if that was true .
in fact , in clinical trials , we should be done , this is a serious matter .
the data came in .
the data coming in in the u.s. , from england , sweden made from sweden , and they all were equally correlation , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we think we &apos;re feeling really , what makes us feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> that &apos;s data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating .
the real thing is , the u.s. usa is one of the only countries around the world that the <unk> are falling down .
that &apos;s <unk> , and we &apos;re ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what &apos;s happened is that we could do this .
well , i understand that . i do this .
because anybody else has t.b. ?
has one one one in the audience ever had somebody die in t.b. ?
don &apos;t often happen very often .
now , what happens in this country doesn &apos;t happen , but monday , in the last year last year .
these are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because this isn &apos;t here , we can &apos;t do it in denial and people like jenny <unk> around the world and the messages from fear and illiteracy and illiteracy of <unk> live .
and you can do that because they &apos;re not connecting the cause and connection .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst human human race .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just a <unk> approach with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except paul &apos;s <unk> and <unk> vaccines , and says how valuable they are , and people should just stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s actually what he &apos;s saying .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul <unk> in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell the <unk> <unk> .
he gets calls from the home because people will tell him that they would like to know where his children are going to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , you know , where the diseases go back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;re now measles .
and that &apos;s worse , and pretty soon , children will be , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just immunized .
what &apos;s a <unk> ? take that . why not ?
and a <unk> of me wrote a couple of weeks ago and i said i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever mentioned before .
she wouldn &apos;t be your child <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe in lagos , if you &apos;re in lagos , you &apos;re going to be a airplane in lagos , and he &apos;s just going to be a <unk> in ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he &apos;s coming to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of those <unk> tonight tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a disfiguring disease , and we don &apos;t know , because the world works , the world is now .
this is the planet that we &apos;re living in . don &apos;t do it as if he &apos;s not .
we love to fix it . we love that .
do you all have the vitamins that all morning , you know ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , which helps you get the pitch .
i know that they did that because half of the americans is doing every day .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is always taking this constantly .
they &apos;re in their urine , and more you are doing almost .
that &apos;s okay , you like to make 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark , <unk> . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a really strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> himself to afford to do .
so we run away , and where are we going to do ?
we run into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious matter because it &apos;s crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little barbs here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , <unk> , because i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions dollars to it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that people scream and say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the <unk> , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not take the evidence of my experts to mammography , or some <unk> , who wants to treat his patient with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where do you think and do magic and science and science , you get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he killed 400,000 people around the <unk> because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more much more than <unk> drugs , which we know that they can &apos;t stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will be worse than any other person of these disease .
don &apos;t tell me , don &apos;t tell me these things .
they have . they always have . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic , where we &apos;re just in , this is the <unk> battle between the <unk> <unk> foods and the <unk> .
that &apos;s a <unk> debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch of every branch , every <unk> , has changed from the people .
you know , there was no paradise paradise in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last century 11,000 years .
and some of it worked and some of it , and some of it is not .
we &apos;ve got rid of what &apos;s not going to work .
now we can make it more precisely , and of course , there &apos;s risks like vitamin a <unk> to do a <unk> , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we dismiss <unk> .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge fields to deal with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all this ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
this is not to do science .
it &apos;s quite a <unk> morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
she &apos;s not a country .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of a <unk> , and it holds millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over over the last 30 years .
embarrassing . sorry .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? well , how to genetically get food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like the <unk> .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s like a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this in a place .
and then people could eat the food and won &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can tell you is why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to do ?
it &apos;s not about genes , genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on higher food , better food , including food .
it &apos;s not about rice here , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do so far as we do , we &apos;re not guilty about something , like , not to be angry , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; you want to go , &quot; you want to get into this ridiculous time and going into the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to go . i want to go .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put these kind of time on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we will move them where we want .
we need to think of these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time we get to the time , we will be glad to be happy .
i know that we can , and as far as far as it affects me , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it may seem weird to be interested in this a magician , because it &apos;s because they look like a delusion that will be a real real , if someone thinks there &apos;s only enough enough to believe . &quot;
in other studies , <unk> have shown a measurable effect , the <unk> impact , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to her , whether it &apos;s only not true enough , a measurable effect on the body called a measurable effect in the body called the <unk> .
a delusion is going to be a real real because someone knows it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least for the 1950s in every childhood for children &apos;s children .
i myself took him from the <unk> <unk> magic <unk> in the 1970s in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to take him out for you and explain him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain him .
so , you see what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , my hand , you can study it .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife so far into my own .
i bring my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of it , i &apos;m just going to <unk> my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that there &apos;s no time to do anything , because as i &apos;m here , you can go out there , nothing in my sleeve , you know , <unk> .
and the goal is just to do .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes fine , the knife will hold up with my bare physical <unk> .
it &apos;s actually true of his place that i can shake it , without the knife , without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , not <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
well , that &apos;s a trick i often <unk> young children who are excited to be more about deception , because you &apos;re looking closely , although it &apos;s a very simple trick , although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably , many of you probably know a lot of them in the room .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i <unk> my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of that <unk> , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that there &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
so in the moment , where i &apos;m <unk> my hand of you , so you move them from the back , and this fingers here , my <unk> , just where he was , in a position where he &apos;s been <unk> .
great great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who &apos;s been there no childhoods .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i <unk> myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a delusion , why you don &apos;t remember the only three fingers , because the mind is , and the way it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s information , one , two , three , three , but it looks like a group .
but it &apos;s not actually about this , and it &apos;s not at all .
of course it &apos;s not going to be there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , by my favorite <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing i &apos;m going to do is , by the way , is hidden by this motion , that the fingers are hidden away .
i take this hand away . and here is the knife .
this trick is able to show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now what does this have to do with the <unk> ?
one year or so i read a study that was really blown me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing .
it &apos;s what it &apos;s like , if you put a pair of placebo in a white pill , in the shape of a tennis ball , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a <unk> , white pill that has a certain effect .
but if you &apos;re the shape of the shape that you &apos;re offering to do these <unk> , for example , in a smaller pill , and the blue colors and the letters that is actually measurably more efficient .
and that , although not any of those <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me crazy .
but it turned out that this is not all that .
if you take a lot more , you &apos;re still more powerful than an <unk> .
a colored capsule that is yellow in one end of yellow , is better than a white capsule , is better than a white capsule .
the <unk> is playing a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact best statistic -- i &apos;m sorry to remember the exact statistics .
but the key thing is , ...
... also , the <unk> play is playing .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you need to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you &apos;re going to inject a patient .
this is a very powerful image in mind . that &apos;s a lot more powerful than one white pill .
this is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time , if you &apos;re a <unk> .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem so good like a capsule that doesn &apos;t look like that , as well as the needle .
and none of it has any really interesting property . it &apos;s just our belief that we &apos;re doing a more powerful impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic magic .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let &apos;s make it look real .
we know this one of the study that you need to reach the needle when it &apos;s supposed to be .
this is an 18 inches long . it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;ll do it first a little bit of <unk> .
this is my meat meat . it &apos;s not <unk> &apos;s special meat meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and through her <unk> , until she <unk> the other side .
if you &apos;re a <unk> -- if you drop lightly , i &apos;ve demonstrated this a few friends in the room room in the room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and she &apos;s a woman almost <unk> .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to get <unk> , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or you know , what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive to the back here .
you can see it &apos;s just a little bit of <unk> , but if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my head , i &apos;m just going to make a little excursion .
i &apos;m really sorry . does you crazy crazy ?
and just a little bit of my skin , and on the other hand , again , it &apos;s back to the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about it .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> himself to have the skin , just to give us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back in the back , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen it . &quot;
people in the <unk> are in the <unk> .
let me show you from the closeness .
that &apos;s my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat meat , and i can do the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re a tomato , you &apos;re looking away , don &apos;t look at you .
the people back up or the people who eventually see the video later , saying , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it was real , there &apos;s a hole , and there was a place , if it was really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yeah , there &apos;s it .
i usually would take the needle out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think there &apos;s this framework and with the purpose of a delusion , i &apos;m going to just go out to be the needle and go and go on the stage .
we &apos;re going to face a couple of times more in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re excited . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people to count the number of books that were released with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they were released after about 40 years , and there were more much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive falling that it &apos;s kind of impossible to make it impossible , clear to happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act by these cognitive traps .
this is true for <unk> , which is about their own fortune , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think that we &apos;re thinking about happiness as well as any other .
the first one that &apos;s the first time is to admit , &quot; complexity .
it turns out the word happiness is not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could possibly possibly could be able to do it , but all the things we need to be , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second thing is a <unk> is an assertion of experience and memory is basically , between happiness and happy his life or happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects the wellness , without knowing it , without knowing its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> <unk> of mine who was covering a story -- &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said , he was a symphony music , and there was absolutely glorious music , and he was a <unk> music <unk> sound .
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that &apos;s what it was ruined with .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruined was the distortion of experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t care because he was memory , and it was ruined by memory , and the memory was all the way he had to keep himself .
what &apos;s really saying is that we think we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there is a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , is able to experience the past , but it &apos;s just the present time .
it &apos;s the <unk> self that &apos;s the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; do it now hurt you ? &quot;
and then there is a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that the <unk> and the history of our life gets vertical and it &apos;s that the doctor &apos;s physician who can address the question , &quot; how did you feel ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey after albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self itself and the <unk> self , and the two of them is being <unk> part of the <unk> of the happiness of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really beginning with a basic reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not only telling stories if we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that &apos;s what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example of an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that are a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into details . it &apos;s not more painful , but she was painful than this trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . they &apos;re the records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more suffered from ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
the patient b has had a lot of suffered . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a <unk> , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much longer <unk> <unk> for the patient &apos;s office .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of the story is , how it ends up .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that they &apos;re all ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the worse is the worse thing that the pain was at the end of its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we &apos;ve asked these people after their <unk> , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a guy in the <unk> in the <unk> .
well , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of <unk> himself , b is obviously a significant time .
well , what you could do with the patient , and we did actually done clinical trials , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s actually done , you could actually move the <unk> of the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient without a way to try to shake it up with a little bit of them .
that &apos;s what the patient &apos;s ever is suffering , but only a bit and much less than before .
and if you make a few minutes , you have a <unk> , the <unk> self is a bad thing to do , and you have a lot of a lot more on the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient , because now the patient &apos;s a much better history of the time is given to the patient .
so what draws a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that gives us the memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and so a story of <unk> are , and the great moments , big moments and ends .
they &apos;re very , very important , and in this case , <unk> , the end of the end .
well , the <unk> self lives , is living .
it &apos;s got a lot of the time of the <unk> , one after the other .
and you wonder , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean most moments of life -- and i did this -- you know , you know , the psychological present presence of life as about three seconds , which means you know , that there are about 600 million of them , in a month , about 600,000 million .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , you get kind of the idea that you should count , what &apos;s happening as this is what &apos;s happening as the majority of the life that &apos;s our lives .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re using as we &apos;re using the world .
and as we use them , it would be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> self for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self itself , and they &apos;re quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the money with time .
from the <unk> , if you have a vacation vacation , if you have a vacation , and the second week , the <unk> vacation is going to be twice as good as the <unk> vacation vacation .
this is how it doesn &apos;t work for itself .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is barely superior to the <unk> vacation because there &apos;s no new memories .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in fact , the critical variable is the critical variable that a <unk> self is different from a <unk> self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , the more <unk> self is more than remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually that the decision that &apos;s true , because if you have a patient , we had two <unk> surgeons in two different surgeons and decides to what it is , then , the one who &apos;s thought that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s chosen the memory .
the <unk> himself has no voice in the election .
we &apos;re not actually choosing between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future after a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as an tyranny of the self itself , and you can think of yourself as a <unk> , even as one thing that kind of <unk> <unk> through experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing holiday , the very frequent , that is , we &apos;re supposed to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and it &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about this , i think i think about a holiday we &apos;ve done a few years ago , the easiest thing i had ever had , and i think i &apos;m a lot of the best vacation i &apos;d ever had , and i think often i think about other people in the relationship , like i think .
and i probably have my memories on this epic journey , i would say about 25 minutes for over the last four years .
well , if i ever opened the last mass , i would have been spent 600 pictures in there for an hour .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s only a half a year .
there &apos;s a lot of the complication .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little <unk> i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you &apos;re making more , there &apos;s a real question . why are we memories that are taking away from the weight of the weight that we &apos;re going to experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought about a thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know , the end of the <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you choose to choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your own selves and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of time , you get an answer , and if you think of you in the sense of time you &apos;re going to get an answer .
why we choose the <unk> , we &apos;re a problem that makes us a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- lucky , more complicated process is a rather complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness , about the <unk> itself .
if you ask happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this isn &apos;t about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy is the person that thinks that person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who doesn &apos;t seem different from the existing exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m involved in a lot of researchers , and i &apos;m involved in a lot of researchers about happiness , which is the kind of thing that &apos;s been <unk> for us .
the distinction between happiness itself is that the <unk> of self is recognized , and the last year of self is realized in the last few years , and you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> of them .
the gallup organization has a world that has been asked a world where more than half a million people have asked them to think about their lives and talk about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about happiness of the two types of self .
and the main thing that we think , i think , is that they &apos;re really learning differently .
you can know how happy somebody is with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really teach them much about how happy he lives , and vice versa , he &apos;s lives .
just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you meet somebody who would come and tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his height ?
well , they would know something about its height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone is being a <unk> , eight <unk> , you know , how happy he &apos;s about is how happy he is about his <unk> .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness of the <unk> is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mainly being satisfied , being satisfied with people who we like to spend time with people who are .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s a great thing .
so if you &apos;re very lucky enough to maximize the two types of self , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
so the implication of what i said here is that we &apos;re really not really supposed to imagine as a replacement for a <unk> .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , a very short reason we &apos;re not aware of happiness is that we &apos;re not going to be looking at the same things as we think about life , and when we &apos;re thinking about life .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you think that question is that people have to be happier in california when they &apos;re happy , say , in ohio .
and what &apos;s happening is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what &apos;s different , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out , climate is not very important for the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people that &apos;s going to be able to get california into california .
now , your <unk> self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , they &apos;re going to be reminded of how awful the weather in ohio was in ohio , and they &apos;re feeling they &apos;re going to make the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think of reasoning , and i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we looked at a couple of weeks ago , i told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome of this place that was taken out of this place .
is that something that you can actually do with you , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the gallup poll is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find absolutely .
we found that in terms of happiness of the <unk> itself .
if we looked at how feelings with income changes .
and it turns out that under a income of 60 dollars in the year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in the year of 600,000 dollars in the year of 600,000 dollars in the year of 600,000 dollars in the year of 600,000 dollars in the year of 600,000 dollars in the year of 600,000 dollars in the year of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re more unhappy , ever getting the poorer they will .
we get this absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not a <unk> , but that lack of money , and that lack of money , and we can actually measure this <unk> very , very clear .
in the sense of self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
the more money you made is the happier .
that &apos;s not true emotion .
but danny , in the entire american department , it &apos;s about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be everything that we believe in the head , and for instance , what we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance to make a <unk> , generally , in fact , the land would take a more substantial than the serious question , and it would make politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s credit for the role of <unk> in politics .
and the recognition will be , is going to be slow , but not a question , but in the u.k. , they &apos;re just going to happen and in other countries , you &apos;ve just just happen .
people are actually aware that they should be lucky , if you think about politics .
it will take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore <unk> or whether they want to explore <unk> , so we need to take this discussion pretty soon .
how to be lucky is very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next year .
in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the people &apos;s population .
that &apos;s what i think is , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this theme , or should be at least the most dramatic political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of the behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane . i design computer games .
i develop a <unk> for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in the reality , as you &apos;re saving in the <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you , more time with playing more than more time playing games .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a lot of time is a lot of time when we think how many problems we &apos;re really going to do in the real world .
but in fact , my research institute is going to be the opposite institute of the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week of a week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we &apos;re going to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i calculated that the need for 21 billion hours a week .
so that seems to be a little bit of <unk> , so i &apos;m going to repeat it , so i can work with the issues that we want to do , and the world &apos;s problems , poverty , global conflict and obesity , i think , we &apos;re going to play games online for at least 21 hours a week .
no , i mean it seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty much , why i think that games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a tudor photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotions of playing games , so he was built in front of the players a camera .
this is one of the classical words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might be able to give you some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also , really , really , really , <unk> concentration , all the real problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some of the little here , looking at the top , the mouth , the mouth , are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows just show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know , you know . ok . so , so we have a number of players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so extremely positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually able to do something that is a <unk> victory .
this player &apos;s a <unk> victory .
and this is what we need to see millions of faces from <unk> around the world , if we take the <unk> the next century , the face of the people who are on the edge of the <unk> , who are the face of all the <unk> on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life , if we &apos;re hard problems .
i call it as &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> , and it &apos;s actually my face , you know ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , like i &apos;m living in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former hometown of berkeley , california , where i looked at my ph.d. in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better in games better than real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as we &apos;re playing as well .
and i don &apos;t just do not just less successful , even this thing .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , i &apos;m good at the context of motivation , something to do something with motivation , inspired to each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think that many of us are going to turn into our best version , at any time and instant , persistent the problem , try to solve the problem , so long as necessary to the <unk> .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing failure , we &apos;re not going to feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we &apos;re threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they &apos;re just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a ph.d. student .
why is it impossible to think of it , to think , could not just reach everything ?
how can we put these feelings from playing into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft that offers the ideal environment to the world problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that will make the <unk> possible in <unk> .
so first , if you &apos;re in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters willing willing to be willing to make them a mission mission , and instantly .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at the time , right ?
so they &apos;re creating that .
they never get a job to do that they can &apos;t fix .
but always the edges of their capabilities , so they have to get a hard job , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and <unk> . there &apos;s always a lot of that important to do .
and there are plenty of collaborators .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to be able to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that , in real life , that feeling that there are a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> .
and also , this epic story is this epic story , and the inspirational story , why we &apos;re doing what we do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have created &quot; level up &quot; up &quot; and &quot; + &quot; a strength &quot; or &quot; + &quot; + &quot; a <unk> . &quot;
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk about talking about a crazy idea , and a crazy idea of 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so the problem of the world &apos;s <unk> is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time , at least on the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;d rather rather than all the time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> have spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of solving <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in the context , <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> year started to go upright .
so the first one is <unk> .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play , it &apos;s just kind of sense of what &apos;s going on at the scale of human development in terms of the human development , which is extraordinary .
but it &apos;s also appropriate . because it turns out , by using all the time we use all of these time , actually transform what we are as people are capable of the situation .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , so creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s what i think .
consider this interesting statistic , the recent university was released by a researcher mellon university , the average boy spends <unk> , 10,000 hours of <unk> <unk> <unk> , 10,000 hours of <unk> <unk> to the 21st century .
so 10,000 hours is an interesting number of reasons : two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the u.s. , <unk> hours of the exact same time they spend in school , from five grade class to the high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a complete <unk> here where young people learn to be a good player , what it means to be a good player , like anything they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the world of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research research that if we &apos;re spending 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of a major theme of a subject of life , we &apos;re going to be at the master &apos;s biggest year .
we &apos;re going to do whatever you &apos;re doing as well as most people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are gamers <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that we could never have a <unk> of human potential .
so many people have , in the world , we have a day at least an hour per day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people , which is extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion gamers that are exceptional pretty good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> developed developed <unk> , saving energy and work on work , rather than the <unk> , so that players can play , in india , china , brazil , online , online , in india , in india .
you would expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have a whole billion of a player .
so i started thinking about what it is to do these games .
here &apos;s the four things i found out . first of all , <unk> .
ok , so , imagine that as extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do immediately , to do a bar , and together , together with the belief that we have a very shared hope .
so the gamers always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth it to try and try and get it right now .
players are not sitting around .
gamers are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows you guys more than we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve got <unk> , even if they &apos;ve got sick .
the reason for that is that there requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that time , someone has time to spend the rules that are going to be more protectionist , that we have the same goal and stay in the <unk> .
so this allows the <unk> to grow the <unk> , trust and each .
as a result of that , we &apos;re building more powerful social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> &apos;s 22 hours a week of a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that when we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard , and we &apos;re going to relax , or nothing .
we know that we are as human beings work , so we do hard to do hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard if you get the right assignment .
and finally , the journey , the <unk> .
players love it , part of the awe of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> , to the right light , you know , you know all wikipedia , the largest rainforest of the world .
the second largest rainforest of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
five million people use every month .
they &apos;ve been collected more information about the world of warcraft , and it &apos;s been collected as any other subject in every other corners of the world .
they &apos;re creating a epic story .
they created an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers who lead to one outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is that they think you &apos;re going to change virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is brilliant . it &apos;s studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we will find the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that makes sense , actually , because gamers can be more than in more <unk> than real life .
you can make more social ties in play , and they &apos;re more of the real life feedback and they &apos;re getting more feedback and reward in games as real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s absolutely logical that player &apos;s player &apos;s time for the world , the player in the real time .
i &apos;m just voice that is logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years of <unk> .
you have these ancient cubes , from <unk> . you know ?
before these fantastic <unk> <unk> there were <unk> .
and these were actually the first of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> of the ancient greek <unk> , you may know this story . the story of how and why games are invented .
loud <unk> were games , more precise , in the kingdom of <unk> , in the kingdom of famine , famine .
laennec , there was such great famine , that the king of <unk> himself decided to take a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> national strategy , and a day would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because they &apos;re like , and they &apos;re very fascinating , and <unk> productivity , because they were not going to eat anything .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to <unk> , they survived that 18 years of starvation , by a day , they ate and the next day .
likewise , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
we &apos;re playing a game to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing a game to avoid everything in the real world that doesn &apos;t work in real life , particularly in real life , and we &apos;re going to give us what we need .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , after 18 years , famine was not better , and so the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they divided the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> and the <unk> to break out to a paralyzing adventure .
they went out and they went to search for a new home , and they were just so many people left out how to survive , and we were looking for the rest of the food that were going to survive and looked at the rest of the area where they were thriving .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent <unk> shows that the <unk> , which would be the roman empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists came to the notion that <unk> &apos;s crazy story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> that took nearly 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story is true .
maybe you actually saved your people through games by taking 18 years into games , and then they had these <unk> and so much about these kinds of things that they &apos;ve gotten through each other , they &apos;ve rescued the entire civilization .
so we can .
we &apos;ve been doing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world &apos;s world of <unk> . it was 16 years ago .
they were working for 18 years , we &apos;ve been collaborating with <unk> years of warcraft .
i &apos;m saying , we &apos;re ready to play our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to the search for a new world , and so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion of <unk> a week .
we should have <unk> that half of us spend an hour per day with playing with play until we solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask : &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and right , i &apos;ve got my work to work on the last years at the time for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto in palo alto , it &apos;s <unk> .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to think of the best possible outcome and then people to empower people to get this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> and give people to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you three games that i designed to try to give people to give people to the future , to give people to bring people to their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> where they need to go through a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it &apos;s realistic , so it &apos;s actually realistic , and you &apos;re actually being realistic , and you &apos;re in the real life , they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> in real life , and they &apos;re going to figure out how much oil costs are ?
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been <unk> them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a different shift .
nobody wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to take the oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure to you .
find out how they would survive . most of our gamers have gone to the game in the game .
so we have a greater <unk> game , a bigger , higher goal than just <unk> .
we have the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
so , what &apos;s starting is the calculation of a <unk> that people have only 23 years on the planet .
now , these supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> &quot;
the call of gamers , to sign , we have to design almost like a &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientist , the scientists , the <unk> and only can you save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 of incredibly creative solutions that you can see if they &apos;re labeled &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we get on the three of march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award , you get the award of the world bank , and in 2010 , in 2010 .
we work with universities in the agricultural and store them to learn a social model .
we have a comic book . we have a <unk> high school , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all the one game to share with young people , in particular , particularly in the world , particularly in <unk> , which is to make their own social social enterprises .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want you to ask you something .
what do you think is going on next ?
we have all these fantastic gamers , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to make tight social networks , and <unk> , and demand meaning to be meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re going to play meaningful games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design these games playing and play .
when i <unk> the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things : that we can make any <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s make the <unk> play .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something which i thought was written a article on a while a couple months ago , a article on <unk> magazine .
i &apos;ve always got my <unk> at the writing of the <unk> , but i was with the stress of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot; really .
i read the front .
&quot; disabled , <unk> , <unk> , helpless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i have a list of a friend according to read and to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i only came to read &quot; fans , &quot; and i could stop collecting and gathering me , and then they &apos;re <unk> by this <unk> <unk> shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought the need to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a imperative that was in early &apos; 80s , when i started to build the primary school , and began to create my sense of the self outside of my family and forms in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me around me .
and god is . i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
if i was a little bit seriously , i was born in a world that someone would be able to perceive as one person whose life could be positive in a long way , but today , i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the odds and adventure .
so i immediately tell myself the ceo of 2009 , and i expected that i find a <unk> piece of this .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
especially , the last words i &apos;m going to shake is the last two words , &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who describe this words .
it &apos;s about the values that are put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of the most vulnerable societies , including the greeks and the roman , they really believed that the pronunciation of a <unk> has a great force because what you &apos;re in the <unk> can also be <unk> .
so what do we want to do is <unk> -- a disabled person or a powerful people ?
just to say , just a person who &apos;s <unk> as a child , it could evaporate , and they &apos;re <unk> and ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up to open doors ?
a man who opened up the doors , was my pediatrician at the <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think , most americans didn &apos;t necessarily get correctly to tell me . so he &apos;s called the gates .
and dr. p. <unk> had always been <unk> and created a lot of work with kids .
i thought the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> <unk> .
i had to have a very <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know to build my <unk> , and i hated it , i hated it , i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine i &apos;ve seen as a <unk> kid with dr. teszler and trying to stop this practice , <unk> , <unk> without success .
and one day he looked at me in one of my practice -- these practices were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so powerful , powerful , you &apos;ll get a day of one of those rigid .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. <unk> , so i &apos;m doing the exercise i didn &apos;t want to do with the way that the richest , that &apos;s the richest five year-old girl in the clinic in the second floor , but he actually made me to see my everyday <unk> with new eyes .
and i &apos;m asking myself today , how very high his vision of mine has shaped me as a powerful girl , and i could imagine as one of nature &apos;s own shaped , and i could imagine as one of nature &apos;s powerful , powerful and <unk> .
this is just an example of many , like adults in <unk> who can make a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the most compelling examples of the <unk> evidence , we don &apos;t give us a space of the language , to imagine something that we would all wish to be : every single one to enable you to see yourself as a powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that were held by a different way through a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the <unk> , the <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the <unk> body , which allow people to use , really , really , to be able to use the <unk> of the <unk> , and they &apos;re giving themselves to the envelope of the world that they &apos;re taking their own .
so maybe this is a little bit of the technology that &apos;s going to be more powerful , because the fact that every person has ever been there , that every person of society can be a very <unk> and powerful , and that the human capacity , is to adapt , our biggest one .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story because people always ask me to tell me about how i &apos;m going to ask them to answer , and i &apos;m always saying to you , this sentence has never been <unk> and i always understand , and i &apos;m always feeling so uncomfortable with people .
this phrase from the mit &apos;s relationship lives by the idea that success or happiness depends on it , and i was a challenge to the challenge , without being successful , because if my life would be so successful , because i could have to perceive the way that i could be with a disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course , are we really , of course , or physically , emotionally , or two , is both of them .
and i &apos;m saying that this is good .
<unk> is not an obstacle that we need to make a <unk> to get to make our lives better .
<unk> are just to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not going to see it , but he &apos;s constantly to see .
and i want to have no way to <unk> the impact , or <unk> of a human being .
there are <unk> and challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real and every person else , and each person is about it , but the question is not , whether we &apos;re going to get rid of it , but we &apos;re not going to get it .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for the people that we love to keep trying to keep in front of a game , but it &apos;s going to be clear to clear good .
and we don &apos;t like to make our kids if we don &apos;t give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you need to get two things : to be able to be an medical fact , to be an active and the other social mind , whether i &apos;m disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability , which i needed to have to be , is that the world is constantly saying , she could describe me with this one , she could describe me with this one .
in our desire to protect people who are at heart and the cold , hard to ask them to connect to the <unk> of their medical habits , or even a prediction of the health care , that we need to be a careful that is positively disabled .
maybe the current concept that is just looking at what is inside a broken , and how we &apos;re going to fix it , for every one of a larger disability than the <unk> of the time .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being as a human , and not all of its forces and opportunities and recognize , we create addition to the natural fight that you might need to , another disease .
we &apos;re <unk> a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the human possibilities .
most importantly , is that it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not be <unk> or either , or not to try and avoid , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor should we go under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize the most fundamental opportunity .
it may be more important to me realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to the <unk> , to embrace them , to give them a <unk> , and you can actually use a <unk> <unk> and maybe dance in it .
and maybe we &apos;re creating it , <unk> as a natural , <unk> and useful , and feel that way through their presence , no longer .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . and he wrote the <unk> anniversary of charles darwin and he wrote about 150 years ago , and darwin , in my eyes , in a very true sense of human character .
i would use it : not the most powerful of the kind of <unk> , and not the <unk> of the kind of <unk> , but the way that can impact changes in the best way .
and in post-conflict creativity , creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the capacity of people , to survive and <unk> , from the fight of human mind is determined to move through conflict .
so again , again , change and customization are the greatest capabilities of the human beings .
and maybe we just know what wood is we &apos;re carved in , if we really get tested .
maybe the meaning of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond that hard time .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are facing a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to do .
i think the biggest damage that we have to have to have to think is that we should be normal .
so , honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there &apos;s the usual . that &apos;s the normal . but not the normal , <unk> person really want to know , if you really had to learn ?
i think more rather than not .
it would be great if we think of this paradigm of normal or strength , to make it even more dangerous , and we can produce a little bit more dangerous , and so we can take the forces of a lot of these many kids , and you invite them to bring their whole and valuable skills in society .
<unk> found out that we humans have people who have to be a <unk> , and to be a useful , useful , and a contribution to a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals has older people in a hundred years , and people with severe <unk> injuries with the <unk> of the people , and that was , because the <unk> in the state of that people were valuable to society .
they didn &apos;t have these people as useless ; they were considered to be more special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city in the city , in the northeast red zone in the northeast red zone , and i was standing there in a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had a <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee &apos;s aimee . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not remember .
when i first saw them , i was <unk> her belly from her mom . &quot;
oh , so , the one .
and of course , it &apos;s done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i knew from narratives about this day , because i was , of course , typical , to my birthday two weeks to late two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> medical diagnostics was on holiday , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , at all , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had been given to them , and i just had a couple of toes on this and a few toes at the other foot , he had to be the <unk> .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never would walk , and never be mobile phone , like other kids , or you &apos;ve never got a independent life , and they have just lying a <unk> . &quot;
really , i found that he gathered around my childhood , i was having collected my whole childhood <unk> , whether i had been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , whether i had a scholarship on the <unk> , and he used to teach me my scholarship or one of my <unk> school at the <unk> medical school and at <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> &apos;s <unk> , the potential of the human being willing .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough , how crucial that can be the factor of the quality of a human being .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; i learned that kids are not going to be told all the time , and even if you get a little bit of support , if you get kids a little bit of support , kids can get a lot of them . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and how somebody relate to it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you had asked me at age 15 years of the time , if i had asked my <unk> to legs against meat and bones , i would not have a second <unk> .
i was really going to be normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe that change is happening , because i &apos;ve been walking around so many people that have opened up the doors , instead of giving people to face , or to give people an idea of the <unk> .
see , it &apos;s really just a human being able to demonstrate how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn it to the inner forces , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone at a critical moment , you &apos;re going to open up a doors for someone &apos;s opening , then you &apos;re a good good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the actual meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something to produce something that is in one , the potential of <unk> .
again , what &apos;s potential to do is now <unk> ?
in the 1960s , in britain , in britain , then they turned into <unk> , then they were <unk> in <unk> .
they call that &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the u.s. , we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are <unk> to grades .
and the one of the students are going to be <unk> harder , get the better teachers and so on .
they then have a <unk> period of students with a &quot; good note &quot; very good . it was told them to be very smart , and after those three months , they were <unk> , and after those three months they &apos;ve really written <unk> .
and of course , it &apos;s going to be a heart , that the way the vice <unk> was said , they &apos;re just not enough .
and it was just after the three months after that .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had gotten the school .
the key thing was the very important trial that teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they simply said that were the <unk> and that are the students who are struggling with the grade , and they have a little taught them and they treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind , who was broken , has no hope anymore , no hope of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and our collective capacity of imagination .
but if we can do it , the human mind is to hope to keep yourself , and to find yourself , and other people around it , curious and <unk> are actually actually actively , and then we &apos;re actually putting our forces .
if a spirit is , you can create a new reality and create new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the <unk> century , and my friend &apos;s friend , and the poem is called &quot; god , &quot; &quot; every child , &quot; not god , and the god , who knows , he &apos;s just four words , he &apos;s always saying , &quot; come on , come on .
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are ?
imagine i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more precise , more precise , more and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more powerful .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be , for good health , live ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always <unk> more creativity .
what would you like to do ?
what would you like to want to do if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many as a lot of people there are creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to make a good memory ?
a few more .
how would it be with fitness ?
a few less .
what is this with longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to admit , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this just a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a <unk> theme here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you a picture of a doctor &apos;s eye .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who also was a <unk> <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a essay in biology , &quot; no , in the <unk> sense of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not going to be evidence of the evidence of biological evolution , it would be a very good at turn to turn them off , and you &apos;ll give you the permission -- and you can give you a glimpse of kathryn <unk> &apos;s book , because nothing in the other course of this talk will be wrong .
but if you accept biological evolution , you remember this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ?
is it for other <unk> or it &apos;s still in the other business or it ?
this is another view of life on the tree of life .
in this image , i put an bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> on the tops of these branches in success , they have survived ; it &apos;s got to be <unk> .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested are .
we &apos;re pasting a shared ancestors on modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years .
in that time , there may be 20 or 25 different types of hominids of hominids .
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems as if we &apos;re right , we &apos;re very remote to the world &apos;s tree of life , but actually the biggest part , are the fundamental mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is clear that we can move from that to be able to use that , and the mechanisms of a shared bacteria can produce the protein of the human being able to produce <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> by what &apos;s coming out of the pancreas .
and so , as we talk about bacteria , you know , every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than the cells of the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think if you ask the clock , if you ask the <unk> , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> area for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you will all get them to provide them all the nutrients , and they &apos;re just going to offer them without struggle .
it &apos;s a really easier way to <unk> bacteria with <unk> <unk> , forced to the time .
but otherwise you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , same as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help the <unk> of the <unk> , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in shape of a species ?
or are we going to be a little different -- something that &apos;s being adapted to the environment is now adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s move back to the time we &apos;re at the big bang in 14 trillion years of -- the earth , the system , the first of the world , maybe three and four billion years ago on earth -- the first <unk> organisms that come from the last year , maybe as much as a billion years , and then the human species , and then the human species , and then the human species , and then the human species , and then the human species , and then the human species , and then
in this giant , <unk> of the universe , is the life on earth &apos;s only short amount of <unk> ; the animal kingdom , as a single one , is a little <unk> .
we were .
and this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope that there &apos;s an <unk> of it .
well , when i was a college student at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i asked , a little fundamental , in most of the life of life in <unk> organisms , is , every cell , and all the genetic information is going to run into both of the cell .
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms , and they started changing things .
sexual reproduction , the picture is coming .
and all of the important : the introduction of sexual reproduction that &apos;s touching the genome , is the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death is the <unk> of our body in the same time as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , having sex / death , death / death -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but every year , it &apos;s got to have an extra time to have the consequences of the time .
i &apos;ve come to understand the emotions of george burns , who &apos;s in las vegas , who &apos;s <unk> in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
before it stands a beautiful <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization of the physician that i was a goal was to be a goal of evolution -- not necessarily , but not even in the way .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to get to reconnect after a disease .
i wanted to make that we live to live and healthy lives .
evolution is all about the <unk> of the genome to <unk> , <unk> , generation generation generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i think like <unk> rockets , to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage to the next stage to drop to the sea .
i think we would all think the mood of the <unk> , understand the <unk> of all the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to make a immortality .
i want to get it by not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily be the longest living in .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily <unk> the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adjust the best to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of surviving and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and that &apos;s the hot and the hot and the hot will survive , there &apos;s a vacuum , and they &apos;ve managed to do it there , there &apos;s a <unk> environment , and they &apos;re going to make it a <unk> environment for themselves .
so what does that mean when we look back in the back , what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and particularly as we &apos;re going to <unk> the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a range of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to evolve .
we &apos;ve reached a way of balance .
and the reason that we were doing is that we have been able to have the first of medicine , a lot of genes that were otherwise <unk> had otherwise been <unk> and had been removed from the population .
and second , we as a species of the environment that we have so made of us to adapt that they &apos;re actually changing right now as well as we can adjust them .
and by the way , we go and cycle and we do so much that they can &apos;t tell us as well , that isolation is needed to be , for the evolution to <unk> .
a second way is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional type of , of course , just to be <unk> by nature .
and the argument that would be the wheels of evolution is slow , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation goes , if we &apos;re going to be a species of planets , there will be insulation and the changes of the environment that might produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility of opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just just , but led by us as a <unk> , and decided we &apos;re going to make us as a <unk> .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s start looking at reality that people are now making decisions about their offspring , in some ways , make decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice of getting more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the single one and the family decides .
so if you think it &apos;s not just possible to choose your child &apos;s gender , but also , the body of genetic adaptations will cause disease to cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate or to eliminate the risk of risk or cheaper ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to want to make these change in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be going to be possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years ago .
it cost cost billion dollars .
the next year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months .
today , you can now have a sequence of three billion base base of the human genome to a cost of 20,000 and a half of a week of <unk> .
it won &apos;t be more long until the reality will be , that it &apos;s going to be the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available to everyone .
a week ago , gave the national academy of engineering <unk> prize for francis arnold , two scientists , two scientists , developed the natural process of the evolution of evolution to work faster and to make the protein in a more efficient way of evolution .
a few years ago , the <unk> <unk> was awarded <unk> <unk> for his research in which he took a adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell is potentially able to turn it into a <unk> cell .
these changes are in .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that not only protect itself , but also the immunity against other viruses can serve .
believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental trial in the gang using vaccine versus influenza , using influenza that grown grown into the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all the reality and the future is going to be much more likely to be .
so just imagine two other changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their own ?
what if they could change the sperm and <unk> or the fresh <unk> egg , to give her kids a better chance to give you a better chance of <unk> -- eliminating the diabetes of the cancer that &apos;s reduce the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want a healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , could allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> , even allow us to adopt a better memory of the better .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of the ken <unk> , especially , if you can expand it , with the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not the fast <unk> have that you will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these will be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we &apos;re going to pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want to be able to recover from <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that we need to be 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years of compress -- and maybe even the next hundred years .
these are decisions with those grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to be going to be , going to be .
do we use these decisions a society that &apos;s better , the more successful , the more successful ?
or will we be selectively <unk> different , which we want to do for some of us , and not for others ?
will we form a society of <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to do to make these choices make ?
in the good way in evil , and as you think , as you think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something you can imagine , a portable robot that gives you your skills , or another , the <unk> of the <unk> helps to stand up and get up to the time .
so at berkley , we call these robots <unk> .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning and give them an strength and you will increase your speed and help them keep the balance of the pace of it , for example , for example .
that &apos;s where the real <unk> is the true of man and machine .
but not just that -- so it goes together , and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we work on , we start to talk about the american soldiers who wears about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that you &apos;re supposed to wear more .
of course , this is a few important complication -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we &apos;d think of this challenge , and we &apos;d create a <unk> that would help with this problem with this problem .
so let me introduce you to now -- or the human race universal <unk> .
soldier : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , for many hours .
so his bold design allows it to be focused on to be in the way , to make it , to make extremely <unk> motion .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then i will raise my strength and persistence .
we &apos;re as far as we think we &apos;re going to imagine this device , this new <unk> of <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our view up to the wheelchair , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are sitting in the wheelchair , in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and this is indeed a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re talking about very young people &apos;s very young people who &apos;s in the <unk> of their lives -- &apos; 20s , &apos; &apos; 40s -- the fate of the destiny was hit and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population that has multiplied their numbers .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a <unk> , or the wheelchair is -- is the wheelchair .
and so , it &apos;s been around 500 years , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapters in the domain of mobility .
so let me introduce you to the <unk> that &apos;s carried by amanda <unk> , who suffered a <unk> ago that has a result that she could not run over 19 years and until now .
thank you .
like i said , amanda is <unk> .
it &apos;s got sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals that &apos;s attached to our <unk> , which is attached to her back .
so here &apos;s <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> on its hips , likewise , as their <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re moving forward to this pretty <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> me .
in a second one second , i lost each feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after a doctor , a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every <unk> hope of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been to learn from the time to learn to go again , to climb , to climb , to climb , to go to the hands .
but nothing was invented me , so i was going to go back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential to change life , to change life , and not just for the military , or to amanda here , and all the wheelchair , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m ceo of the ceo of a nonprofit organization called the robin hood .
if i don &apos;t , the poverty <unk> , i <unk> as a <unk> <unk> of a volunteer fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers of volunteers , the volunteers of a <unk> <unk> has got to be pretty early on the <unk> to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer for the <unk> , so i had quite good opportunities .
but it was still a race for the other volunteers to reach the people who would be doing .
when i thought the <unk> <unk> , he was very serious about the <unk> of the <unk> , which surely one of the worst days of her life had .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the <unk> and a barefoot on a screen outside the <unk> rain , while her house was burned in flames .
another volunteers , who arrived in front of me -- call him <unk> &apos;s <unk> -- got to be asked to go to the house and get asked to save the dog &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was some lawyer or a <unk> who could tell the rest of his life , the people who could tell him that he went into a <unk> house to save a living house faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; well , i have to go to the house .
you need to go up to the top , and you have to go back to the fire , and you have to get this woman a couple of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i &apos;d hoped to me , but i went to go -- the stairs , the hallway , by the time , that were pretty finished , and the bedroom that was pretty finished to get into the bedroom , the bedroom .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my fingers back down , where i was the front door my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we put our treasures out of the outside , where we were going to be surprised , and not surprisingly , his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> had a letter of the <unk> to the brave use of the brave operation for the rescue house .
one of the things that &apos;s alarming is that somebody &apos;s <unk> , somebody had to put her pair of shoes .
both in my profession at robin hood , as my colleague , i was <unk> , and i witnessed generosity and <unk> at the big scale , but i also see how much of the charity and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see in this room , and i see people who either have reached success , or on their way , i want to offer you to offer this to offer you to offer them , wait to the point : don &apos;t wait .
wait for the rest of a different way , you don &apos;t wait to have a different one to do your first million .
if you give something , you &apos;ll give it now .
they use them in a <unk> , rooms in the neighborhood , in a park .
be a mentor .
not every day , every day will give us to save lives , but every day offers us to change one day .
so they &apos;re going to get rid of it ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come on .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that &apos;s been <unk> the secret of humanity .
a place where women lead the <unk> to the <unk> , with sex &apos; words , and the game is being a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> either or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their neighbors .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the congo .
bonobos are related to chimpanzees our next living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived around six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are famous for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of human evolution in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees , fear <unk> are going to run , <unk> , will run the <unk> of <unk> females .
they really came up with the fact that this leads to a <unk> society , where the fatal violence has not been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known as primates .
they live in the deep depths of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re just hard to get access to it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the <unk> of a violent argument that has been <unk> for decades , and almost so many life needed to have the world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction is not the survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of the <unk> are actually that you could not even put a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh , that the trees are upset .
who are these related ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , even more <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so much conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life is more than the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play long .
play is not just <unk> .
for us , and she &apos;s a game essential for connection to connection with relationships and the <unk> .
and we &apos;re not going to trust and the rules of the game .
play is an <unk> creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , diversity of connections .
and when you look at the bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a <unk> on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we &apos;re seeing a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she &apos;s got it in the eggs . &quot;
i think it &apos;s like that , it doesn &apos;t really be true .
yeah .
so , <unk> are spread , both in bonobos than people .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , which is you &apos;re going to give new elements -- as the testicles -- and also , as the game is , both of the trust , as well as it is for the same time -- while it &apos;s making it .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take many forms of shapes which some of which some little <unk> are <unk> , <unk> -- maybe to find the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and she plays peacefully with water .
i think exactly how they &apos;re going to do sometimes sometimes , and we &apos;re extending <unk> boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that lets us do research , interact and interact with the unexpected of the unexpected , the <unk> of creativity .
this is just a little <unk> of the insights that bonobos give us to our past and present .
but it also true a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to dramatically challenges in the world , through greater creativity and institutional cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
so to be successful in a <unk> world , we have to play .
but will we do the best from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
and the other thing , bonobos , and people alike not have their own teeth and they &apos;re not <unk> .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , play is the game of the <unk> .
and so , my favorite <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution and together while we &apos;re talking about creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in 1979 , in 1979 , at the same day , in the same time , each <unk> a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each one of the baby is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want them to think too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you think the whole time you &apos;re going to listen to me .
so , imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , they &apos;re in a case that is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> that &apos;s on the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the sperm triggers is an x chromosome that &apos;s on the x chromosome .
both of these are <unk> , both of the light .
we &apos;ll still come back to these people .
most of my activities i &apos;ve got two <unk> .
i &apos;m in a hat , and i &apos;m in the history of the anatomy .
i &apos;m a sophomore , i &apos;m studying , and in this case , i study how people <unk> anatomy -- that the human bodies , animal bodies -- like <unk> <unk> -- as they &apos;ve thought about <unk> <unk> , with <unk> .
the other hat i was carrying to work is the <unk> , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as a nine-year-old , is a <unk> lawyer -- by people who are the patient &apos;s patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have the <unk> social norms in question .
so i worked with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were very common .
and very often i worked with <unk> people whose gender <unk> is -- so people who have no average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different shapes .
i just give you a couple examples of the kinds of <unk> that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> , which we have <unk> stage , testicles are grown up at their own feet .
and so the testes is the testes at the <unk> stage .
but because of that individual individual &apos;s missing is missing the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so testosterone testosterone , but not a reaction .
as a consequence , the body develops more to the typical male than we followed .
if the child was born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as girls .
but it &apos;s usually time to grow when you reach puberty and grow your breasts and develop , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone &apos;s coming here .
and they do some tests and find a few tests of <unk> and in the <unk> , in fact , they &apos;re usually <unk> in action and they &apos;re a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you might be able to be male for the fact that you &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that &apos;s called a little <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> are made of <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , like me -- i think i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual life , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i &apos;m talking about <unk> .
we &apos;re creating <unk> and we &apos;re talking on <unk> .
the implication is that somebody like me , is that more <unk> being subjected to be a woman who was born with <unk> , and a woman who has been born with her <unk> , and a <unk> .
so gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , can you be distributed across the range of the range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as young as young as young , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he was in the face of the man .
he had a more extreme form of a <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> <unk> so much activated that they &apos;re basically creating a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> of male had been in his brain , his brain was subjected to the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- nobody had a guy .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he &apos;s inside the <unk> , that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , creating something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , gender can occur in many different ways .
the reason kids with this kind of bodies -- be <unk> or identical twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often , because this is not because it would be <unk> by their own health .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re very different to make different kinds of surgical interventions , because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical form is associated with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a woman &apos;s identity ; it was a black person , meaning , &quot; <unk> , an african anatomy with regard to your own history .
so we have this terribly <unk> idea .
and when we &apos;re confronted with a body , which is actually something very different to us , what is very different to these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> ideas .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , two people are in a body .
where i had experienced most of the excitement , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender <unk> was asked to be asked in berlin world <unk> in berlin .
a lot of journalists called me , &quot; what test will you do , &quot; which will you take a test , which tells us whether or <unk> <unk> is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature is not to line up the line between the male and female and <unk> and female and <unk> ; we &apos;re <unk> and <unk> .
so we have a situation where we continue to have our science at the time , we need to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve held for granted that these categories were a lot of <unk> <unk> to create permanent <unk> <unk> .
and it &apos;s not just related to gender .
it &apos;s also true in race , which is as much more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
in our <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
so , we &apos;re going to push into the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we &apos;re just talking about a few <unk> ?
while we continue to move through science , we &apos;re increasingly going to be increasingly in a <unk> area of the <unk> , where we need to recognize the <unk> categories that we had to be very simple .
we see that in all sorts of different parts of the human life .
one of the areas that we see that the <unk> is to see in the world , in the united states , in the united states of the united states , are the fights of the life and the end of life .
we have hard talks about what &apos;s going to be a body to people , so that he &apos;s quite quite rightly as the civic life .
we have very difficult tapes nowadays -- maybe not as public as medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors never had to fight as hard to fight when someone was dead .
they &apos;d only be a feather that would be under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried it .
if you stop moving more , you &apos;ve buried them .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we can take people &apos;s organs to take people &apos;s organs and want to put people in their own .
and as a result , we got to the fight with the fight with the really hard question , and that &apos;s what is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation to have the simple <unk> of the <unk> .
now , you could think that the whole thing was the <unk> of the <unk> , somebody would really be happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these are really much more insecure than we thought , are tense .
and it &apos;s a lot of us to think about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i have to shut first , i &apos;ve got a big fan of the founding of the founding .
i know that they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and so hard , and so radical , in what they did for me all of the few years of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because what happened to happen with the <unk> of the <unk> .
the founding fathers were the original activists , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s the original hindu activists .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were using it through another , that was radical and beautiful years for us to survive .
as you remember , our founding fathers , the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood blood .
they were the notion that people who have political power had to have that political power , because the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s father &apos;s son and so on .
the organizers of meadows and they were using it , they were using it through a new <unk> concept , and this concept was that all people have created the same time .
they <unk> the field and decided that <unk> saw the commonalities , not the difference , and that was very radical .
now they did this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things together in common .
democracy is growing up , but at the same time , the science grew .
if you look at the history of the founding of the founding , many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s world , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s world .
they went away from the <unk> of the kind of <unk> , and meadows things like a <unk> concept of power , back to the transmission of a very <unk> , <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and so , if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they took us a concept that was about <unk> commonalities .
and so they have prepared it for really wonderful , the future of civil rights rights .
they haven &apos;t thought about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened next ?
for example , women used to be the <unk> , the concept of the founding , saying that both implicit in more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and <unk> , which is not important enough to own the <unk> , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> successfully .
next was the successful civil rights movement where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> this , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of the <unk> line , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin color that are <unk> in both <unk> , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the commonalities , we need to start asking for question why we sustain certain <unk> .
well , mind , i want to have a certain <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to not like a fish that is not the same right as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have the right to give their permission to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomic <unk> that make sense to make sense , and we think , i think , keep it .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we keep them , and if they &apos;re good at good .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 , both the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of <unk> was born , so she was born in june one june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to the <unk> , so he was born at the march of 1980 .
because of the fact that maria was born , maria three months <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> at all three months of <unk> -- the <unk> sex of having to choose right , to choose the right .
<unk> <unk> has to be , not because he &apos;s actually another biological age , just because of the birth of his birth .
we &apos;re still finding other differences in what their rights are .
<unk> , because you take a sense of male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the <unk> -- because you &apos;re just saying that he &apos;s male , he can now be moved to what &apos;s a male .
maria , can &apos;t be able to perceive all the same states that <unk> <unk> in all states , and that &apos;s right to get married .
<unk> <unk> can be married in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanently <unk> categories that are more problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do is , because our science is going to be in the field of anatomy that we need to admit that democracy is a democracy based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give you science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is on .
so where do we go ?
it seems as a dignity of a sort of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to move somewhere somewhere to move around , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people turned into a very strange position .
so for instance , texas , texas , that is that a man to marry a <unk> chromosome , and a woman to marry a woman , you know , you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested for their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a solution . &quot;
he says , we should not be human , but the quality of their skin , &quot; judge , and is the quality of their character , &quot; and goes on anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , this sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you learn people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re supposed to be <unk> right to people because i have to admit that i &apos;ve got a series of golden <unk> that probably are more likely to make more than some people i know .
i want to make a <unk> , i think , are probably some bright <unk> , more intelligent , more optimistic , more likely to meet their sexual relationships than some <unk> , which i know .
so how should we be the question of the nature of the character ?
it turns out , as a really hard thing .
and part of me , what if the content is , if the content is a personality something that would be a <unk> , that would be made in the future , could be made by an mri ?
do we really want to go in this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to think about the idea that the u.s. government is really struggling to make thoughts about questions about questions about democracy .
in our effort to make democracy , we &apos;ve done our job right now , and i think we would make our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , in iran &apos;s case , where a man who wakes up to other men &apos;s being attracted to death with death , unless he &apos;s ready to perform a <unk> of the death , which is because he &apos;s ready to live in life .
there are no way we exist in this way .
i &apos;m glad to say that we haven &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon who was talking about a few years ago , who had a few previous twins twins with her , to separate them to the part of the time .
but when i was driving him , and he asked him why he made these same surgeries -- it was very <unk> surgeries -- was his answer that was very bad , and that kids would have to be very bad treated , and therefore he had to do it .
and i said , &quot; well , they &apos;ve learned political practices , rather than an operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they &apos;re going to change in the state of will change the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to find that i &apos;ve been going to talk a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of democracy , or what might be looked like if we had the moms to have more involved .
and i want to say something that is a feminist object , and i think that there could be different ways of insights that are using different kinds of anatomy , using the various types of anatomy , <unk> people , <unk> people .
since i was interested in the years , because i was interested in the <unk> , i also care about research in the field of <unk> .
and one of the things that i really felt interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , in average -- not every , but in average -- more complex social relationships and the caring for people who are vulnerable to the group of vulnerable , much more attention to people .
and so , if we think about that , we have an interesting situation before we .
so , when i asked a graduate school , i asked myself a <unk> , who i thought was my interest in feminism -- i thought , as a feminist feminist , so it &apos;s still -- i &apos;m going to ask myself .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> about gender , so that &apos;s feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something <unk> in feminism .
this is supposed to be something that could give a little , on average , which is women &apos;s own male leaders of a male , different social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers were extremely <unk> to find out how individuals could be protected to the state of state , we can actually be that , if we <unk> more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more to the concept of the <unk> , not just how to protect them .
and maybe it &apos;s that we need to be where we &apos;re going to be able to make democracy about anatomy &apos;s anatomy -- less about the individual body to think of what identity is empathy , and more about relationships .
so that , if we &apos;re trying to make a people &apos;s <unk> connection , we think what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got to do is i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to find out every chance of finding another <unk> configuration , and i &apos;m going to photograph the same time and to photograph and to kill them .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of <unk> hand hand in <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my favorite life , and also my <unk> .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars serve , i think , is a good thing , and i &apos;m looking quite unique ; it &apos;s going to buy my personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my height ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are that i feel like i won &apos;t be a win .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i sat on for this sort of exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anyone do with that many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pair of bags , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> <unk> for a week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i have a bet that i would like to wear anything i would wear , find , if i first wanted to go to palm springs .
and since you heard me heard as the woman who &apos;s driving here at ted in her underwear -- is called the , i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i want to give you my favorite <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to tell you some of the lessons i &apos;m not thinking or not , i &apos;ve learned from these <unk> , nothing new to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look at less than 50 dollars as a 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the coat , has 55 55 to me , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this entire week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be <unk> , bad <unk> , if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you move other happy people .
tuesday : adapt to totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to try and be , i myself , to adapt myself .
be just who you are .
if you surrounded the right people , they &apos;re not just understanding it , you &apos;re going to estimate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i looked like i was playing , or i remember her .
i smile like i like , &quot; thank you . &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think , you look out in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only as i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just sum up for you .
if you believe they &apos;re the inside and the outside one is a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing to wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience here .
we should be able to figure out everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- the golden <unk> , golden <unk> .
and finally , saturday : a very unique unique style to design is a great way to tell you a world , to tell you a word of a word .
it was always used to me and again , and over that week , people were just coming to me , just because i had great conversations .
obviously , that &apos;s not going to fit everything into my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i will donate it back to the <unk> .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn is to learn these week is okay .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally emotionally <unk> because the right thing is going to be a different crazy , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , waiting for me to hang a little <unk> of that , and search for a little bit of love , and it &apos;s quest .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , everyone together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows in italy , and the reason i show you , why i &apos;m showing you this is one more interesting in the last decades .
so a few time ago , if you wanted to win a formula for a race , she took her budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver &apos;s good enough , you won the run .
now , if you want to win , if you want to win a race , like this one -- something that <unk> the car in real time , a few thousand sensors that are going to make information from the car , and then process that benefits to the system and then apply things to that car .
this would be , in <unk> , a <unk> call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a <unk> portion and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting is that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting to be in our lives .
our cities were , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be a computer in the free .
and as a computer , in the free , they start reacting to other ways they &apos;re being perceived and driven .
if we <unk> cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
and the way i want to mention , is that cities only are two percent of the land &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
and the cities , pulling all this view and move all of this to the everyday life of life .
this is from an exhibition that is paola antonelli at moma later in the year , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s &quot; that &quot; talk with me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if each atom is out there , a sensor , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is really changing the interaction that we humans with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as the old dream of being a <unk> .
you know , as a michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he took the hammer , and actually , you can still see a little <unk> <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , today , our environment , for the very first time , we start to respond to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , again , with the idea of defining our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i want to show you is in fact one of the first of our labs .
it was about a hundred years ago in italy .
and what we did was to use was a new kind of network that was used to use all the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk> information from this network to make sense of the system that works on the order to understand how the city is collected .
the summer of the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was the <unk> won &apos;t win the <unk> .
some of you will remember , it was in italy , in italy , in italy , in italy , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy , has won the end .
now , look at what happened on this day , just watching the activity of activity that happens in the network .
here &apos;s the city .
you see in the middle of the middle , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline , the timeline .
in the afternoon , people in this afternoon , people and there are the phone calls and move .
the game starts to stop -- silence .
france is a portal . in italy , a portal .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second <unk> <unk> . end of the normal time .
first of all , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s going . yeah .
well , at that night , everyone went to celebrate the center to celebrate .
they saw the big meaning .
the next day , all the center to go to the center of the <unk> and meet the prime minister at the same time .
and then all the down .
you see the image of the land <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> time , people have time to celebrate the people -- to have a big party , and you see the answer to the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we could not have a few years ago .
another one is another example of feeling : this is not about people , but to be the things that we use and consume .
now , nowadays , we know all about how we get our things .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , like they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers around the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with a couple of volunteers that we have helped to have a year in seattle , and tagging things that they &apos;re doing -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that would throw them out of it .
then we have the little chips that little little brands that are separating in the garbage and started to track it .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;re just getting at .
by seattle ...
after a week .
and this information we realized with that information is there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in which we actually do less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day , the cup that we throw away , not just it &apos;s going to be somewhere else on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re always just throw away every day .
and if we would show that people , then we can move a behavior change .
so this is the one of this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you have a lot more about the sense of perceiving and many other wonderful things that you can do with you , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part of the world that we &apos;ve discussed in the beginning and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> spain .
it started to a question of the <unk> , who came to us and said that spain and <unk> a nice tradition of water in the water of water as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you bring technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were in a <unk> <unk> was , you know , they were going to be <unk> , and the valves , <unk> , valves , that open up and close .
they &apos;re going to do something like a <unk> <unk> of water .
if you fall down the <unk> , you can write them on the pattern , images , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and he &apos;s going to open up to the open and you can see them in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor <unk> .
it &apos;s got very much like him .
and we got the assignment to design a building , to design the expo .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
all the building was out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and let it go .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s drying out , if you want to reduce the pitch , you can actually leave the roof down .
or you could end up the building , and you could get the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this day , when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they haven &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappearing .
here you see the building .
you see the person who &apos;s asking what happens inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that gave the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what one night was when all the sensors stopped .
but it was a little more fun at that night .
all the children coming out of <unk> came to the buildings because the way they played with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open up to you , but a building that &apos;s still breaks and still breaks in water , you had to jump in the water , you had to jump out without getting wet .
and that was , for us , for us , as architects , engineers , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people , the things that use things that are using .
but the reality is always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interact with people .
so here is a picture of the building with the physical <unk> of water , the water <unk> of water and the projections .
and this is what we got to think about this project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that <unk> could actually start flying .
imagine if you &apos;re able to have little air , you could fly little air through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you saw earlier , which is moving in sync with other in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or an ad , like these -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or <unk> , but in three dimensions , where what changes the light is , not the position of the <unk> .
they can play different kinds of species .
imagine the screen just as a screen , or just appear in different parts of the screen , in different parts of <unk> .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud of <unk> to you , to you , and through that you can move through them , and you can look through them from many , many directions .
here &apos;s a real <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> v to shape the <unk> .
if you turn the lights , it looks like this . so , as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single person is being channeled .
it could every single <unk> you have a impulse that comes from people , from the motions of people or something .
so i want to show you something about first .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in <unk> -- we &apos;ve taken its movements in 3d <unk> to use it as a recipe for the <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> dance dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so they can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have all the <unk> , they can play with color and motion motion and play <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want as a potential to use the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working in the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage people &apos;s people to do something and change the environment -- almost as something we call , <unk> pathways like that , a <unk> device is moving , but a cloud .
imagine if anyone can give a little donation for a <unk> .
i think that &apos;s remarkable that &apos;s remarkable in the last few years , the last decades is that we &apos;re developing from a physical world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it &apos;s making it all the internet .
nowadays , we can -- we can -- and the campaign of the obama , we can see the <unk> of the digital world , which is to move forward to the physical world of the networks .
that can be , in our case , we &apos;re using it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow &apos;s , to ask the challenges of the challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to change the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually actually put people into the people that they &apos;re doing together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water as our cloud , as our cloud is a cloud .
it &apos;s an actual physical creature in london , but with <unk> .
they can move in the inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually see it in the bottom of the bottom , which is the most important moments for <unk> and more of the connection to use the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something to go to the top you can go , like the <unk> new <unk> .
you can get inside .
and a sort of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for all of the experience to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the context .
by my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in the middle of the antarctica , i was at the edge of the first <unk> .
i was <unk> awe .
my heart beat me , i was <unk> , while i was trying to figure out what was going to be front of me .
the <unk> around me , <unk> <unk> , i was just wonder , and i was just wonder that this was a snowflake on another character year year .
<unk> are born as a <unk> of a glacier or by putting out of <unk> .
each one of the iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their surroundings , and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and <unk> until the bitter end of the time , whereas others can &apos;t withstand a lot of passion in a <unk> .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , separate and just just as we often see people &apos;s isolated and you &apos;re very much as we often see .
but the truth is far away .
while a iceberg melt , i &apos;m <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
while the iceberg is melting , it &apos;s <unk> drinking water , which feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go back to my footage that i would make portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments of this way , and never exist to be there .
it &apos;s not a death , if it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s not an end , but a <unk> of her <unk> along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;m <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last images i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in <unk> in greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you actually see a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
and i want to look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s in the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat is moving to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it <unk> about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , you know , you show the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you very much .
my life is really extraordinary about work in some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i ever worked was , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading years of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the one .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes yet .
i was told him .
i have a company , the design and animations , graffiti is a bit of a complex part of what we admire in the world and watch .
so we decided to , tony -- <unk> -- and his cause .
i met his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we will give you this money , &quot; we will give you money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i asked , &quot; wait a minute , is that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the <unk> people communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he replied , &quot; no , just if you heard about higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how does you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody have the film &apos; &quot; <unk> and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- they walk along , they &apos;re walking along .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came with the need , just a check , and i put a check out and i made a check out of how i was supposed to be <unk> .
i kept asking myself to place and ask his brother and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is like , &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony &apos;s going to be a device that can make his art and we will find his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s carrying all this is to be able to communicate it . &quot;
so i was talking a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from <unk> , and this research research lab , and they have a technology that lets them put light on any surface to make it a <unk> on to the negative area that &apos;s just the negative area .
so they &apos;re going to go around and make it <unk> like this .
they say all things that are going on on top of the top , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and finally the people in the <unk> are actually art .
but there was always a life life in the presentation .
so i went home and ate my wife and she was telling her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you should find your eyes , you should find a way that can make a laser <unk> , so that he could make it back and can be a <unk> . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of organization , we &apos;ve done some things .
first , we have the insurance companies that were the doors , and actually , actually , you get a device to get a device that he can communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or get an e-mail , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is amazing . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers from around the world -- literally from all around the world -- literally from all around us .
my wife , my children and i went to garage and the hackers and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful enough to do that , and we &apos;re going to <unk> and all the pictures on the walls were <unk> .
but for two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children were involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought at the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things out of the hardware store and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they put them on a <unk> <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to it -- you can build it yourself , we put it in the code for free , you can download it for free .
so we created a device that &apos;s fully free to the constraints .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital .
so , every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that &apos;s incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
i love this image because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his bedroom .
there &apos;s all of this <unk> unveiling that &apos;s great unveiling .
and after a year , two weeks of planning , two weeks <unk> , <unk> and <unk> nights , i drew to the first time after seven years .
and this is a gorgeous image , because this is his life support system , and he looks about his life support system .
we &apos;re just falling down to the bed , so he can see it outside .
we put a match on a wall of the <unk> in front of the hospital .
and he drew again , once again , in his family , his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
so we had to put in the parking lot into the parking lot , so we were actually feeling as part of the <unk> .
at the end , he was sending us an email with this content , &quot; for the first time , seven years i &apos;ve been drawn to .
i feel like i was going to keep underwater , and finally someone got down to the bottom and the head , i &apos;m going to breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that stunning ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that keeps us down in the process and we &apos;re going to continue to evolve .
and we need to improve much on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> right there .
and someone who has a <unk> potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us earned it .
it &apos;s all about our own pockets .
so the adoption were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> on us and then , december , has been honored by the <unk> , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> &apos;s -- and this is the whole circle -- it &apos;s all the circle -- that this april , the <unk> <unk> in downtown los angeles to be an exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
and there are pretty much the hardest practitioners of the <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty scary .
so basically , i think , if you look something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible to do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible to be impossible .
make it possible -- you all this .
i &apos;m not a programmer and never had to do anything with <unk> , but i just have a little bit collected and with amazing people to put together in the legs .
and this question , every one of them should be , and every single day that you have something to do something that needs to be done , if not now , when you &apos;re going ? and if not i , who then ?
thank you .
so i &apos;m writing for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most commonly <unk> .
and i always tell people i don &apos;t like a scientist , i &apos;m going to come from a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen a farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and i share .
well , a epiphany , an <unk> , is because you have left it somewhere .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends , it made me -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was being beaten in the <unk> green and blue <unk> , until a tutor , to a tutor .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the <unk> .
they did <unk> .
it did for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was hit me in california , california -- i found a lover -- and i was getting it to work on the &apos; 80s , i was getting it to work on the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from this teacher , and i was post a call from this teacher , and she said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve learned each other than adults have learned to each other .
you can ask , you can get a garden , and please come together with the man , i know they &apos;ve found it .
and i should mention that i have a <unk> , and i want you to be a quick . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laugh , and we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them to , and we went to them , and we gave them up to her family eight , because it needed to be , for her family .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know as adults , i met myself , she turned to a box of ash , and became a <unk> .
what happened was that the circle closed was a circle -- and the revelation of the revelation of that i was talking about .
the revelation is , the death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i &apos;ve rescued her .
and you know , this part of life takes everything that needs to take all of the rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is not mentioned here .
it needs to be the same -- he would need love , love and delight , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
so imagine a big explosion in a <unk> <unk> .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
this is <unk> <unk> .
well , i had a unique space on that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had the machine <unk> , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot introduced the machine to the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route .
it &apos;s the heel of the heel .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> , the <unk> . &quot;
i had to talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , because i was feeling that life was to finish .
so i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have these <unk> , we have these things that are going to be , and i thought to all the people i want to do , and i thought to all the people i wanted to do , and it didn &apos;t , all the lines that i wanted to do , and i never did .
while i thought about it later , i realized that , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad mistakes . &quot;
because if the wine is far , and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to have more about life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about that day -- and that was when we got george washington bridge , so pretty much about <unk> -- there was a thing that i was really <unk> -- because i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really want .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i <unk> , i &apos;m better to become better , what i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i have given my ego space .
and i &apos;m <unk> the time i wasted things for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i don &apos;t have two years with my wife &apos;s wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a right ; i &apos;m making it happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inner clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to crack in 20 parts as you know what you &apos;ve seen from a documentary .
while we &apos;re <unk> , i had this feeling , man , not die .
almost like we prepare for our lives for this .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and the sadness , the sadness really <unk> , which i just wish to wish is .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
so , after a month , i went to a <unk> one , <unk> , <unk> , not much <unk> .
... yet , not .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i know like a little kid .
and in the world , everything in me all the sense .
i realized that i was going to set up the dots and connected the dots that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was not going to die in that day , not to die .
i got another gift to see , namely , to come and come and get different .
my call all the time you &apos;re flying today is : imagine , you know , the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine how would you change ?
what would they do , they would be <unk> , because they think they &apos;re always there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want to build the bomb that the bomb build .
the most important <unk> there is to be <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
if we can now predict the systems that make the systems that <unk> and the control , we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are running <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective <unk> on a laptop &apos;s <unk> , which is used by a <unk> machine to <unk> these gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will leave in the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s a cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to <unk> our research six months ago , we were completely unknown to the sense of the sense and purpose that was the purpose of the purpose .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , what the most <unk> part of the most <unk> part , made by <unk> , made by <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed to be a little <unk> in these <unk> boxes that <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> our attention and we started a <unk> project where we had our environment with <unk> infected , and examining this .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , who didn &apos;t like the cheese -- <unk> , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made in my eyes no sense .
and after we had different kinds of cheese , i went to my own <unk> attack .
completely to a certain destination .
the <unk> <unk> is activated in the gray box , when a special configuration is detected , even when the special program that it &apos;s going to get you to get away with that goal .
and if not , then , don &apos;t do anything .
so , the thing that really happened my interest , and we started working with it almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could , for example , is an <unk> american power station , or a <unk> station in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we found that it &apos;s two digital warheads that are <unk> in two digital warheads -- a smaller and bigger .
and we also noticed that they were very high engineered , by people who had apparently been <unk> information to have the <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> them to attack .
probably , you know , you actually knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard about that , the <unk> of <unk> complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science science .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see some footage from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart .
so what we first looked at first was <unk> <unk> because we know what this cause .
and then we searched after <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring this to the real world in relation to potential goals .
so we needed arguments about these goals that we could prove or to prove .
to make these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be iran in iran because most of the infections were reported .
well , there are not several thousand targets .
and basically , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to take a list of all the experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called her to the point of what you know to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
so the rotor is that the <unk> part of the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and if you &apos;re <unk> the speed of this <unk> , you actually actually <unk> the <unk> , and actually explode the <unk> .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually actually , slowly , and make it happen to make <unk> , obviously , trying to make <unk> , so they &apos;re not going to be able to get the way to come up on it .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of that by looking at very precisely data and looked at the data .
so , for example , the number <unk> comes out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to <unk> scientific literature , about how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called <unk> , and every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it could fit together .
and it was better .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 layers .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
a very identical structure .
so again , that fit together .
and this was a big confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t make me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just the way .
these results were going to work through several weeks of work .
and often we ran into a dead <unk> and we had to collect us .
but anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads of the origin of the origin of the world , and the same goal is <unk> , but it &apos;s different directions .
the little <unk> takes over a <unk> , and <unk> the rate and slow it down , and the big <unk> comes with six <unk> of interactions and manipulated .
so , in the big , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;re actually confident that we &apos;re actually sure what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- made me <unk> .
down there &apos;s gray box , and you see the <unk> <unk> .
well what does this thing is that it &apos;s made that the <unk> values of sensors -- and for instance , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> code , which is still under attack , with forged data , running data .
and actually , this is the wrong <unk> data from <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> where during the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s more dangerous and more vulnerable .
the idea is to <unk> a digital digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough to be fast enough .
so in a power station , if the big <unk> is too fast , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human being done .
so we need to have digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re at risk , terrible things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the <unk> , nor the <unk> will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i say is very important .
think about it . this is the attack .
he &apos;s not doing anything with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , it &apos;s just as good work -- in a power station , or in a <unk> machine .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it at <unk> .
you could also use a lot of <unk> technology .
you just have to get it as far as you can get it .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence that we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is that attacks are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green fields , these are the most vulnerable environments .
we need to make the consequences and we &apos;re going to make us better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was very much about reported that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
is that too ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s the <unk> involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , luckily .
because otherwise , our problem would be larger .
thank you , you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i spent the last couple of years studying myself in situations that normally &apos;s very difficult and they &apos;re kind of dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i photographed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing to eat -- just like this -- just a little bit of a difficult , a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous .
i actually have to be the biggest part of my career being subjected to <unk> situations , and all the way to explore society is so what you &apos;re compelling , and hopefully in a way that &apos;s what you &apos;re compelling and to make it more excited about the audience .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to come here in a tedtalk world and <unk> , i knew i was going to do something a little bit of a little different .
some of you may have heard of it , i &apos;ve had a display on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent a few <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the possibility to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , we got an amazing opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson that &apos;s going to never let me go back to the talk -- the <unk> of the talk had a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence to the suv .
so what you got was , you know , you &apos;re presenting this : my tedtalk , you know , what you have no idea is to be the subject , and the one you can ever get to the content to fly your ears in particular , particularly if i was going to be stupid .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity , but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning i knew anyone would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me this , i would not be able to have to tell you that to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the commercials .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going to go in some pretty terrible situations in some pretty terrible situation , but nothing could prepare me to do anything so hard and so dangerous like this guy to go and make it so much more .
you know , i had an idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , using the whole film , through <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from top up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , fully <unk> -- from the <unk> you &apos;re going to see the movie that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> center ...
these people are being connected by the film in egypt -- forever .
and so the movie is going to explore this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the american .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to be the brand x <unk> , but we will be able to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the film .
so we may sell a shoe , and it &apos;s the greatest shoe that you ever have , the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever had ...
the biggest car that they &apos;re ever driven , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a <unk> message , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing you , is that brands are part of life , actually , you know , to bring it to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the concept , the whole film that came from beginning to end up .
and i would like to look like a <unk> to get this to happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how resourceful people are going to be .
have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use a point , because that &apos;s an negative <unk> -- but you know how to develop this ?
how much money is needed to do that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it all the way , some really known brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we &apos;re seeing a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think about how the answer is ?
the answer is , you know , &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing to do , or a difficult thing to me , or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
so , meaning , not so optimistic .
so , my doctor , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people who have to do with it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; well , imagine the camera out of &quot; dignity that we wanted to make a <unk> .
it turned out that it meant that it meant , &quot; we want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just disappeared these companies , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the concept of advertising is to be your product as many people to present as many people as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , this intersection of new and ancient media media landscape -- is not the idea that &apos;s not the idea in this new exciting exciting thing that makes the mass of the mass of the mass .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was the one .
no , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake .
that would have no problem whatsoever .
that would have been okay .
but what &apos;s the picture of this picture is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re in transparency in the <unk> , this is one of the first images that appears to be .
i really like you , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and understand immediately , <unk> from <unk> and the access to information , especially , what <unk> is , surely , the last line is to be the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency .
our leaders are saying , our president , say , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to the way it &apos;s going to be done , something changes .
but why ? well transparency is fear of <unk> -- like this strange bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and she &apos;s very risky .
what else is a risk ?
a whole bowl of food ate a lot of food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell a story .
we want to tell you a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see when i was a kid , and my father caught me in the <unk> -- and there he is , and he &apos;s sitting there saying , &quot; my son , he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , you know , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company that was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i was , john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to do the <unk> and go straight with my team to the companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is , is a tremendous problem , a <unk> problem .
i have friends , the big , giant <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> of my little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , say why their films are so successful , to the <unk> , that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , giant <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see words in the movie ?
whenever i do , i &apos;m going to go on the way , and i &apos;m always , if i open the <unk> , you will see the <unk> <unk> .
and every time i &apos;m a guy , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you going to be ? you &apos;re slightly nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so you might be asked to <unk> a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choices .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as women -- rigid , <unk> , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can ask all your questions and give you an <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so these things -- you know , remembers people &apos;s remembers -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in trouble -- that &apos;s why we &apos;re interested in .
so in which words would you describe to ban ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
woman : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that &apos;s going to do under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> , fresh .
i think , &quot; <unk> &quot; is a great word really , that this is really a positive positive , in contrast , &quot; and the <unk> smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times , three times .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the guy in the street , who are like me , <unk> .
and you should tell me about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love nice clothes .
and the <unk> , &apos; 80s , meets <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is , &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of <unk> and such a stuff .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and a stuff .
woman : if dan would be a brand , he probably would be a classic <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman # 2 : partly a bit of , partly , partly <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
boy # : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> throughout the country , globally .
so i think that &apos;s my brand is my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man # 5 : brand <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t be all the <unk> , but i &apos;m looking at a lot of the time of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what struck noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could enter my head , someone who could really help me understand what the <unk> is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , helped to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for the people , they could also help me .
you &apos;ve got your pictures , right ?
i have this one image . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit of how that with your thoughts and feelings about them is connected to them .
these are the people who shape my worldview .
tell me of this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- like people around around you , the friends , the way that you live , the way that you live , the work of life , the work of the work .
all these things come from a place and start to come from me and start , and i start to virginia , in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you about that .
so the next thing . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what kind of context is that the thought and emotions are about ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i love things that are different .
i love things that are weird . i love weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you take us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? in which what &apos;s the <unk> are you right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , which is not they &apos;re not .
so what &apos;s going on for another <unk> ?
... this is not to be frightened . in what kind of rollercoaster do you have ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . so . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> had two separate separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that &apos;s kind of a contradiction .
and i think some companies are going to focus just on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid the things that they &apos;re not sure are not secure , they &apos;re being scared , and they turn them to be in a little bit of positive , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> <unk> .
what else does that kind of brands act ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , the wii , and a mini , mini <unk> and <unk> .
well , there &apos;s <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a very powerful thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if anybody asked you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? they &apos;re something that &apos;s going to bring blood in a <unk> ?
or are they more likely to a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , <unk> , conservatives ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh , fresh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , profane , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
or are they rather like a <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they created , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and wise as the dalai lama ?
in the course of the film we had more than 500 companies that are up and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; said , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they wanted to do anything with this film , because they had no control , no control of the finished product .
but then , 17 <unk> were willing to give up to the control of the control that they wanted to do with someone deals with their business , playful and wonder like that , and we &apos;ve got to tell us stories , stories that would not be supporting -- stories that would not have to support .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using <unk> nowadays to make the <unk> of the brain , both of the kinds of movies .
we went to sao paulo where <unk> was banned .
in the entire town , there &apos;s no <unk> , for five years , not a pasting , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school school where companies are in <unk> schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got to get most of the feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what those brands did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really really be their interests in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the performer directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think is going to think of the world .
and how did that for you ? what it was successful ?
now , since the film that film was 15 film festival , we can look at this .
and according to the <unk> , the next time in january , and then -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
it &apos;s actually just a time at two one two weeks .
this is just online -- not press , no television .
the film was not going to be .
there &apos;s no one that &apos;s not online . no <unk> .
it &apos;s not yet coming out in other countries .
well , after all , the film has a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project , at almost every single <unk> of the clients that we talked to , their customers , the fingers .
something i believe is that if you &apos;re taking a chance of driving your opportunity to take risks that are going to be able to put together in those risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid the employees , you know , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel like that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of what they might be .
finally , in the process , we should be able to be <unk> .
we should put the bear inside the cage .
so , bless you . bless you welcome your risk .
and a big taste of dirty taste is , so we &apos;re welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should be <unk> .
nowadays , more than ever before , we get a little bit of a lot of very much very good .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; they presented with that <unk> of <unk> , who was presenting for a good friends to pay for ebay on ebay .
big data will turn to the world around the world into big opportunities .
<unk> presents : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
thank you very much .
now morgan , the transparency of transparency , what &apos;s going on with the $ <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , clicking on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check at the height of dollars in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so 18 months ago i did something else at google , and i &apos;m <unk> to make some of them with museums and art . my favorite , which is also , i gave a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> of trials and stories that can tell you , with 17 , is in the 17 place of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to concentrate on the future .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and her access to it .
i grew up in india .
i was given a great education -- i didn &apos;t shave -- but i had no access to many museums and this artwork that i &apos;m not working with .
so when i went to visit , and i started to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked on google , i tried to try and make this desire -- art technology -- to lead technology together .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start to start the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning of the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to be <unk> .
you can look around in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , van gogh gogh .
i actually come in one one of my favorite , at the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very easy .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and <unk> .
you want to get in the museum ?
open the map , and you &apos;re opening up with a click .
they &apos;re in , they want to go up to the end of the interviewee .
just keep . so much fun .
and so on .
thank you , but the best one comes .
so i &apos;m a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who really are interested in art , can click on -- but i &apos;ll take it away .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been introduced with the so-called <unk> .
so this image for instance , about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to do for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can put it very easily in and <unk> .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want deep in .
and so i started playing around the way i was going to do it , and i realized there &apos;s something that is happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , this is interesting . &quot;
i was getting up close , and i started slowly slowly , that these kids actually beat something .
i worked a little bit of a little , i spoke with some famous , and actually , it was in the <unk> , and it &apos;s a game called <unk> &apos;s <unk> , where one would hit the <unk> with a stick with a stick .
it seems to be very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned about something about it .
to really get close to you , you can go to the foragers .
just to give you the <unk> , i &apos;m out to see what you &apos;re getting .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best part is , but it &apos;s a second .
let &apos;s jump to the moma , back to the new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
so , in the previous case , it was about detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s only when you want van gogh a masterpiece , and a <unk> ?
you put in <unk> . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite <unk> of this image until i really did that .
this is <unk> , probably never seen as seen as this .
so i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is really cool part , it &apos;s called his collections .
each of them , every -- they &apos;re wealthy , or poor , if you have a great house -- it doesn &apos;t matter .
you can start making it , and we create your own museum -- made all these pictures you can use your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; <unk> .
you can put anything with just a little bit of them , and you &apos;re sending your friends , and you start to think about what they &apos;re feeling when they &apos;re doing these masterpieces .
i think , finally , i think , is the main thing that all the wonderful things here are not google .
they &apos;re not going to be out of the museums .
i don &apos;t want to say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re hoping that we &apos;re just going to just run in the digital medium of art , and they &apos;re just <unk> .
and this is the biggest question i asked asked , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a football ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s going to add to experience .
that &apos;s how thank you . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be cut in two halves .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half of the right is the ones that the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of each hemisphere , we could pose your brain .
for instance , this is one that someone &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you be the brain on this scale ?
some of us have decided to be an extreme introduction , but i think that most people in the audience , your brain is about so that it looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time in the two quarters of the time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , collectively , with most of the experimental <unk> of logic , which takes a good amount of logic to add together .
but at the same time , we need a good measure of the experiments in actually the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love it with things .
so we go out and play it and look at it and look like it , and then we start to develop this intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they evolved over the years is probably a thing to be able to be just at the same time .
i mean , it may sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;re not born .
i remember to see a child playing playing a <unk> .
he was a toddler , and he &apos;s not very good at it , and he fell constantly .
but i bet that the thing that was taught him with the <unk> is a very valuable lesson , which is the big stuff you can just leave and stay in a place .
and that &apos;s a great <unk> model of the world , so long , they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re not playing with these little weird particles , but these little weird particles .
and if you &apos;re playing with their particles , they &apos;re all sort of weird weird stuff -- like they &apos;re flying directly through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and we called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you took a quantum theory to describe little bits .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe them to describe the great kind of mundane objects around us .
this is not liked my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i don &apos;t play with them sometimes , but not often .
and i haven &apos;t seen it .
i mean , nobody ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t really enjoy it .
because if all things are made out of particles and all these particles , the rules of quantum consequences , wouldn &apos;t simply simply not just the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it should not be so .
so i would make my damn better work with all the things that we could show in , that <unk> also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was <unk> in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that the little <unk> dot there in the center .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
so here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to zoom in . we &apos;re looking at exactly the center .
and here is a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal is a springboard and a springboard to be shaped above .
so i made this thing in a way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours to all these big devices .
so for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to this sort of <unk> <unk> of the hole and getting the thing .
this thing has this thing has to be the capacity to be <unk> in the <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m on the elevator , i &apos;m doing all kinds of weird things , but then i do all sorts of other things to turn other people , and i &apos;m going to make it <unk> , because , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics is saying , &quot; <unk> objects are feeling that way .
the <unk> for <unk> objects are not just people , but the light that looks in it , and the wind that &apos;s going to be carried by you , and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal is <unk> , we had to <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we took the light off , put it into a vacuum and <unk> all the air , and <unk> it up to almost the <unk> , it was the piece of metal free to behave like that .
so we measured its movement .
we found it really , really , really , really .
instead of it , it &apos;s just calm , it &apos;s <unk> , the way it was like this , like this , like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so we gave a little push into a little bit of a push , we could not <unk> it at the same time , not to vibrate -- something that &apos;s just allowed to be in the mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean for a object to vibrate at the same time , and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms are there are quiet silence , silence and moving , same atoms , and the same time they move .
just to be precise , they &apos;re <unk> .
the rest of the time are <unk> .
so that means that every atom at the same time in two different places , what is that the same piece is called the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the green space , because , you see that the <unk> between a atom and a metal is about the difference between the piece of metal and you &apos;re just in the same way that the difference between the metal and the play .
so if one atom can be a single atom at two different places , that piece of metal in two different places , why don &apos;t you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is to say .
so , imagine you &apos;re at a very same time in a couple of places , like that ?
how would you deal with that body is that your body is <unk> in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal always was there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the gulf in reality , are just <unk> objects that are <unk> in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about how mechanics tells everything that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than more of you , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should think we should think of the economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work and work , they want to choose between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition to bring new people on the people .
right now , we &apos;re very far from that goal .
there &apos;s billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to open up .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them .
so we could just <unk> the world very easy to <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
this may sound for you now , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
they &apos;re just going to do the construction of homes against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they did not know , but not yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what they would be to be about to be in those homes and their environment to avoid avoiding and <unk> .
so it turns out , as very hard to all of these <unk> .
but you could go to a completely new place , building a fully new block of building , <unk> the laws that would support like this , and not being married .
so i proposed that governments create new spaces that have enough place to provide them , and they &apos;ve given them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the challenge of a reform in the academic academic .
they knew that every year every year , about 75,000 <unk> of their land , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and can just make the same thing in the <unk> .
in this place , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens if we <unk> a <unk> area of our country &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> , and if you &apos;re going to work in the <unk> , and you can work in the area of the <unk> rules , or the united states , can &apos;t be ?
in the summer of 2009 , cyclone <unk> was assassinated .
in the next half-century , elections , <unk> <unk> <unk> in a shift whose program was both of innovations , as well as the <unk> promised .
he was calling <unk> to be his <unk> .
in the meantime i prepared to take a talk at tedglobal .
by improvement , try and research through the research research , i &apos;ve tried to try this complicated concept of <unk> city to the general elements of the city .
the first thing , is the importance of laws , laws that determine you cannot be able to do not <unk> existing .
we &apos;re giving new technologies for the new ones , but for the progress , it requires technologies and laws , and these are usually laws that we &apos;ve got to know .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk on the tedtalk .
and again , it showed him <unk> .
the two <unk> me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s take the <unk> of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotels in the <unk> .
i &apos;ve made a lot of things to make sure , how much more are they are more valuable than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think is worth a area in some cases per year per year is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was quite abstract discussion at a point when there was a pause discussion , in a place , <unk> said , &quot; paul , could we have the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk made in very much more powerful shape that a <unk> city is a place whose beginning is , a <unk> country , which is the laws that govern there , and the people who have the opportunity to choose either under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of my freshman , who meant that we need to make this project , that &apos;s important , and that &apos;s what &apos;s important to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to <unk> and i was at the fourth grade and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve given another talk to facts that have a graphics like this includes a graph that &apos;s trying to make a lot of value in a city , which is to be a very large city in a city , it &apos;s a very large city to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of <unk> , and the sketch is , the new airport is built in <unk> .
alone , at the airport , it has a solar area of 100 <unk> .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the <unk> of the city , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
politely have all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and alert .
the head of congress came up on the stage and i said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you for your talk , but maybe we might be looking at the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you &apos;ve got the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line , a new city to give people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in <unk> , rather than hundreds of miles away from north .
and a new city includes new possibilities for executives .
the leaders of the government in <unk> would rely on the aid of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> benefits to the <unk> and the <unk> would encourage you to have trust that everybody &apos;s going on .
and the lesson of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> i thought was to be able to be <unk> to build the city , and to build this city , <unk> , suffer from fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area area .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s not a thousand thousand miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , they voted in the constitution for a change in the constitution to have a <unk> control that &apos;s <unk> for special <unk> .
in a country that &apos;s just a very violent crisis , in the congress , congress was elected to a vote for the <unk> of the <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress , but twice by congress .
on january 17th , it was a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and 24 , i &apos;ve been struggling with about 30 <unk> of the world that &apos;s two places that were interested in the business of the world , which is the store of the <unk> .
the one place is south .
this is a picture of a big new urban city that built in south korea built large <unk> of the urban center .
everything you can see on this image , within four years , after four years , it &apos;s taken to get the permits to get the permits .
the other place that is very interested in urbanization is singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china and the third one is in preparation .
so , if you think about it , it &apos;s that we &apos;re going to be here today .
they already have a <unk> ; and they think it &apos;s a second one to the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that allows us to participate in the <unk> system , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered its supreme court to provide the court of the <unk> calling the <unk> of the <unk> system .
and also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually put funding into a donation .
one thing you already know has been understood , there &apos;s lots of <unk> .
there are many businesses who would like to enter in america , especially at a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live there .
over the world , there are 700 million people who say that they would like to live in a different place .
one million people out every year every year , latin america and moving in the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to , their families are willing to give themselves to work at work , sometimes the single mothers who need to make money to make food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes sometimes kids are trying to find their parents back to some cases that they &apos;ve seen in some decade , for a decade .
so what &apos;s it for an idea to think about a <unk> of a whole new city ?
or even more <unk> of building , or <unk> , all around the world ?
so what &apos;s it for an idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition to make new inhabitants ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends of honor have asked me to say , thanks to ted .
do you know how many choices you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a poll with over 2,000 people , and the average number of choices , the <unk> of the typical day is <unk> .
and also recently , recently a study was done by ceos in which they saw a week of the ceos .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics , which is to be preoccupied with the scale , and how much time they spent choices to make the subjects .
and they found that an average ceo of the week of doing work with recurrent tasks .
each of these topics , of course , is made of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions have been a <unk> for nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many choices you meet in the nine minutes in a given category ?
how good , do you think they &apos;re going to be able to overcome the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
well , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , please raise your hand , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question is , are you willing to hear anything about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very , very <unk> <unk> , at least at least , at least .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we &apos;ve been in fact , in a while , in fact , in a while .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how do you get it , you know , how do you ever get a little bit more ?
here &apos;s the oil spill .
they had about 75 different kinds of oil oil oil that were embedded in the boxes that came from thousands of old <unk> <unk> .
so i decided to visit the leader of the head , and i asked the leader , &quot; work works , that you really do all these options do you have to offer all these options ? &quot;
and he showed the ceo of tourists , and the <unk> day , and they usually had their cameras .
so we decided to take an experiment and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gait .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> directly at the entrance of the <unk> .
we have six different tastes to <unk> or 24 different tastes , and we looked at two things : first , i guess what would be more people are going to stay and try and <unk> ?
there are more people left when there were 24 / 7 , about 60 percent than when it was six percent , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what people were buying a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
and people were left to stand as well as it was 24 , just three percent of actually actually <unk> a glass of glass .
and from the people who were left as six were , well , we saw that 30 percent of them actually actually bought a glass of <unk> .
now , if you do math , people bought six times a glass of glass , who they had six times a glass of choices when they had 24 24 choices .
now , to choose not to buy a glass of glass of <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that the <unk> of the world is affected by very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even if it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is , the reconciliation .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m describing with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were making decisions for nearly one million americans in the united states of about five and a million people in the united states .
and what we looked at was the number of <unk> that were possible to a <unk> , the <unk> plan , which affects the probability of the tomorrow , is going to be saved if you &apos;re saving more tomorrow .
and we found that there was a context in which there was a context .
so in this plans , we had about <unk> plans that we had to offer something between two to the latest fund of the people .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered to be that , in fact , the education rate was less likely .
now , if you look at the extremes that plans that offered two , they had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost <unk> 60 fund , the <unk> <unk> is now <unk> .
now , if you &apos;re in the fact that even if you &apos;re willing to get involved in the choices , if more options were , it &apos;s negative consequences .
so people who decided to participate , more likely to get more opportunities to them , the more of the time , the more of them , is more likely to take them and fund .
the more opportunities they were available to you , the more they put their money in pure <unk> .
no extreme decisions , right ? that &apos;s what someone recommend people who &apos;s recommend if your future is important to make your future well-being .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key consequences of negative consequences that are conducive to more and more choices to make them .
they &apos;re pushing the decision -- they push , even if it &apos;s <unk> for her own .
they make more worse decisions -- poorer cash and poorer medical decisions .
they choose to choose more for things that you &apos;re less miserable , even if you make it objective better .
the reason for this is that we might be able to make this huge <unk> of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t move the comparison and <unk> something like that , and actually , actually , the fantastic offer of choosing .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on various ways to have tested in various forms of <unk> -- which is they &apos;re going to apply in their business .
first : limited .
you heard it before , but it was never true as much as today that is less more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just let me . &quot;
they always worry that they &apos;re losing losing .
but in fact , we &apos;re more and more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to go to the <unk> , the <unk> will get rid of the sales , and then there &apos;s a increase in sales , it &apos;s <unk> &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a <unk> improvement .
and as a <unk> and gamble , the different head of <unk> and <unk> types of <unk> , they experienced one increase in sales to 10 percent .
as the golden <unk> corporation , her 10 <unk> <unk> , they &apos;d experienced that the revenues to <unk> 87 percent -- a result of the two , the increase of the sales and the reduction of the cost of the sales and the cost of cost .
you know , the average <unk> of the world today gives you 45,000 products .
so a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products to have a 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is the <unk> supermarket in the world &apos;s <unk> , and they &apos;re just allowed to give you a little bit of products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a cans .
now in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the best examples that recently come on the market , and how to make the best choices that make it , something that david <unk> has very powerful , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered to harvard .
every single one of harvard people automatically takes a part of a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice , 20 years , they &apos;re offered , not 300 or more fund .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to let it happen .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to <unk> them , it doesn &apos;t . &quot;
now before we &apos;ve been having lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was ready to take all the people in this audience to offer a <unk> vacation of offer to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you like that .
and now i give you a couple seconds to read them and ask them to clap when they &apos;re ready to take gary of gary .
okay . everyone &apos;s ready to embrace gary &apos;s battle .
are all that ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
you knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact that you &apos;re very carefully looking at first information , when the second time , i would like to guess it &apos;s a car that would be real real time that they felt more real time .
because the images made it for you very much .
what &apos;s going to take me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between the ways to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that &apos;s how to be vivid and felt that will be very specific and hard to feel .
why people spend 30 to 30 percent more than 30 percent of a <unk> or a spouse , than at cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and it turns out that if you make it , it &apos;s a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we have done in a study that i made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- employees who worked all for <unk> -- and these people were all in a gathering of the <unk> .
and as this session , we &apos;ve got this session , as they always did , just as she was always , just added a little bit of a little bit .
the thing that we have in conjunction with was that we asked people to think of people just to think of all positive things that would happen in their lives , if they save money .
in the course of the world we did this simple thing , there was a increase in participation for 20 percent , and there was a increase of the number of people who were willing to save or a increase in four percent of the amount of numbers they were willing to pay for .
third technology : <unk> .
we can make more categories more categories than more choices .
so here &apos;s an example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> &apos;s <unk> upward , varies the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 papers , and i &apos;m going to show you a little <unk> of <unk> , or these 20 categories , and they &apos;re <unk> that i gave you more choices and give you a better <unk> , when i gave you the 400 one of the 400 <unk> of that , if i gave you 600 / <unk> .
because the <unk> tell me how i can keep them apart .
here are two different types of <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left is <unk> , and the ad on the right is the jazz , then you clap in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think the other side of the left is jazz and the ones that &apos;s <unk> , then you &apos;re clapping .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
so on the left , jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> to the <unk> is something to give you the choices .
and this is a problem that often happens when they look at the long lists of all these fund .
who are actually supposed to inform ?
my fourth technology : the timing of complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think , we need to simplify them .
we need to move complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
so let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to give you your car completely to <unk> .
they need to make them make their own decisions for their car .
now , these are the decisions in the number of choices that make them make a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , we &apos;re going to get gears and four .
so what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the choices .
half of the users will go from the many possibilities , <unk> <unk> <unk> , four gears .
the other half of the users are about the small possibilities of the very , four gears , and the <unk> , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how do you care about .
if you &apos;re all the time , the <unk> of the decision , is that they &apos;re being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that people who are going to keep the very low branches of the low branches and the <unk> .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choice to the crowd , then they &apos;re going to stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is that the sequence is being presented to change in this information .
if i start to start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the two things that choose the same , i don &apos;t know anything about my preferences , it always throws me to pick it on .
it also <unk> me too much about the big product i &apos;m going to be , and so i &apos;m willing to make me deeply , i &apos;m getting to my interest with interest .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that i &apos;m telling you about the problem of <unk> -- -- will you get the <unk> alternatives of it ; <unk> -- make better , we can do more categories , less possibilities , less possibilities .
every one of these techniques that i describe to you today is to help you help the possibility -- good for them , you can use them for yourself , good for the people who deliver service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re being asked by the selection .
and the more we are driving to pick the people , the better , we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then , therefore , this is important .
we all want to be <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , comedians -- that &apos;s so infinitely hard to be hard .
but <unk> have enabled that we all have to be famous or all the creative activities of the world are famous to a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous to the internet to the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours , a minute uploaded to a <unk> .
it &apos;s only going to be a tiny percentage of ever <unk> and thousands of times , and so the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he photographed before his house in the national park park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like the video last summer for first time .
in fact , don &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re just doing this , if you &apos;re called the <unk> mountain mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually sent to january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video of the course of the course of the time was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk> .
rebecca <unk> is one of the birth of the year , a <unk> video of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; the &quot; double <unk> &quot; appears to be not .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , it was friday that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other tips are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , a lot of blogs started to write about this .
michael j. nelson <unk> was a first thing to make a joke that was a joke about this .
so important is that one person is a person or a group of <unk> a mouse , with a large audience shared and <unk> the process .
then these community formed , and they shared these big <unk> , and they started to talk about it and playing it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parody for every single day of the day .
unlike the 20th century entertainment entertainment century , the part of the community is the part of our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by getting it or something new .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s just , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you keep that crazy , you &apos;d be able to know that there &apos;s a <unk> of that there &apos;s a <unk> , four million times .
even cats are looking at this video .
cats have look at cats that video video .
important is the importance of creativity that &apos;s in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
and a whole <unk> fired from the floor that made it a silly joke to something that we can all participate in .
we don &apos;t just find out of something we &apos;re doing .
who could have all the <unk> ?
who would have the &quot; double <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> black or &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what <unk> did you write , where do you put this stuff together ?
in a world , every minute two days of video , video is just a really unique and unexpected <unk> of <unk> as the ones i mentioned .
i admit i was not very much interested in my friend , and i was supposed to look at this great video , about a guy who was protesting in new york to <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> .
i got a ticket because i was not <unk> , but often there is a disability that &apos;s not going to let you drive the <unk> on the driving system .
and that was completely surprising and humorous , casey was <unk> <unk> , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true of everything we do creative .
and that &apos;s all going to happen to us .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and the audience is destined .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his start at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as a <unk> of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and you &apos;re not paying attention to the media today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about 10 minutes of the connectedness between women in three generations , and how the amazing strength of those connected was <unk> girl , when she was sitting in the <unk> of a four-year-old girl girl , and she was sitting in a little <unk> of the <unk> of the chinese little <unk> and a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of this little <unk> of the time ?
the story is not over .
she &apos;s a game that &apos;s being put together .
i want to tell you some of the most important story .
so , imagine the first piece of one : a man who &apos;s burning the <unk> .
he is a poet , a writer , a man whose entire life of the very simple hopes of unity and liberty of his family was held together .
hold it to the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , as he has to admit , is that his life had a single waste .
the words , so , the words of his friends , <unk> now .
he went back to silence .
he died , broke through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me let me do .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my assignment to learn that the story was trying to figure out to us , we know it was going to be a <unk> .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> on lake <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a marriage marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life was her assignment : the escape from her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat <unk> <unk> .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear was in front of the rape and death and death .
like most adults , my mother wore a little <unk> .
so , at a <unk> , only my sister would have been my sister and i , you know , my grandmother &apos;s loved .
my first memories are from this boat -- this is continuous <unk> of the motor , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , who came a lot of times , but the <unk> of the men were <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , or to the <unk> of the motor , who didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> coast of the coast coast , and at the young man who collapsed , who collapsed and died , the end of the first time was too much for him , and the flavor of the first <unk> of the time was given me of the <unk> .
no apple ever tasted that way back to it .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended up in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations who build together a new life .
we were leaving down , one of the <unk> , one of the <unk> of the <unk> , whose populations are made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> <unk> were in <unk> , between people who had shared common , they started to <unk> .
my mom was working on farms , then at one millimeter in a <unk> , six days , six days , twice the layers .
it was kind of finding out of the time that they have english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every one dollar has been given and was in another training education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do was the new stuff that would come from .
two few prescriptions are the school , each one to the <unk> in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because they had to pass six years old .
and there was the rare , but it was painful , and there &apos;s &quot; the <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s &quot; 71 , go home . &quot;
after where ?
something <unk> itself .
there was a meeting meeting the reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s grandmother .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my assignment to stay awake , until her <unk> came to her <unk> , so i could <unk> them .
she opened a <unk> , and then a <unk> and a <unk> .
and the women came with their stories about men who are not <unk> and angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans were looking for a lot of sponsors .
centers were built .
i was living in <unk> .
in one of one , i was the classic asian student student who asked the <unk> demand .
in the other hand , i &apos;ve been involved in <unk> life , the tragic scars of violence , the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many got the job of the job .
and because of that aid , i was in my last year of the <unk> as young as young <unk> of the year .
and i was being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
<unk> le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was <unk> , refugee and social activist , who was invited to be invited to the places that she never heard , and in habitats whose existence could never have conceived .
i &apos;m not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to be in the routine and the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who are in the same time for 20 years , and she &apos;s like the stories of the day and <unk> the stories of her day and three .
i said my mom , i wouldn &apos;t create it .
she reminded me that i was so old , as i was at the time , when we climbed the boat .
no no way ever had an opportunity .
&quot; do it just &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and training , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more i talked to , the more i should tell , i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did , they were , they were living in the limits of the possible .
and although i graduated from my conclusion , i realized i could not live with a career in law .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new -- not just fine , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easy to collapse the <unk> of the <unk> , so easily , you know the assumptions of the environment .
i went to know enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world &apos;s <unk> , but not as you can do it .
possibilities that were not allowed to be <unk> , very severely encouraged .
there was a energy , an incurable optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; we &apos;re not going to hire a <unk> challenge .
we had no penny in a year .
at the end of each every single episode , i took a giant <unk> soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant in this , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
just a journey there .
my gut is again .
three months later i was moved and the adventure continued to continue .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> , social norm and the local state of the local .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died after her birth .
her mother , she just moved her on .
and then she was a second woman in 17 , whose mother was struck .
and without a support of man , she was worried about a <unk> , by a <unk> , and she brought it in front of a <unk> , and a larger <unk> , when she won .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; be &quot; very <unk> .
i was just in a hotel room in sydney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at them on the other side .
i knew she was coming to sue .
my mom rang me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> , and sat around her .
we told her stories and we <unk> her , that we were still with her .
and then the monk came from , and he said he &apos;d have to close the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand warm and the rest of her is cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s holding it in this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t stop . &quot;
if there &apos;s a bond in our family , it &apos;s going to be the women .
see who we were , and how life was shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives , we would have come to the <unk> .
defeat was just the defeat .
now i like to have my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever be a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m scared of <unk> , before <unk> .
can i give you a bug in their lives , the courageous every wave , <unk> <unk> of the engine , the <unk> <unk> of the engine , the <unk> of nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it could be safe , i would do it .
another is <unk> mother &apos;s day in the fourth grade or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it at all of the photography ?
because of course , this is a picture that you can record with your camera .
but i started photography when i received my first camera camera , at age 15 years of the time 15 years .
i combine it with my former <unk> of drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera , in the process , was in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process of a camera ends up when you squeeze the trigger .
so , for me , photography seemed to be a little bit of about to be a real place to be at the right time .
i believed anyone could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to make it happen when the trigger is going to be .
photos like this : a construction site along a much <unk> road .
but it &apos;s a unexpected twist .
and still a realistic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all the shared objective to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m <unk> .
because of course , you &apos;re not something you can actually capture , but i want to make it look like that , as you could have , as if you could have this , on a photograph .
pictures you need to think about a very brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s a little bit more to catch an idea , as a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes realistic appearance ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but the last thing is , how we &apos;re going to understand the world , and how it can be made of a two-dimensional space can be made .
it &apos;s not about realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
so we have three perfect physical objects that we can identify with each other in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , you can combine something that is still creating a little bit more in three times than whether it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really just make sense of it .
and i see the same process in the combine of photos .
it &apos;s really just about to combine different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think , because otherwise they &apos;re just kind of false .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to go to the point to achieve a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
but combine something special as this one .
so the first rule is that , together , combined to have the same perspective .
secondly , combined with employees have the same <unk> .
and these two images are , these two demand , and they &apos;re shot out of the same height and the same <unk> .
third , it &apos;s about to make it impossible to make it happen to make the individual images and end up creating it seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to tell how the photograph was actually put in .
so by looking color , contrast and contrast to the edges of these individual images , rigid clusters , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we &apos;re <unk> the envelope between the various images and take them like a single photograph of planes .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is only a landscape of being being in and the bottom section .
but this is actually completely composed of images from pictures of different places .
personally , i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place , because you don &apos;t have to go with a compromise , you don &apos;t have a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i was in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to plan them to plan to find the different places for the jigsaw .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> <unk> .
the bank is from a different place .
the <unk> <unk> was made of a quarry quarry .
and yes , i actually put the house up on the island of red , to make it look like the <unk> .
to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after this , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of being planned .
and then if you make good shots , the result is pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so , these are all sorts of tools , and the only thing that exists in , is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to talk to your patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to have was a <unk> to go to a <unk> .
and i &apos;m not particularly a little bit of a cup of -- you can imagine a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient , families , relatives , who are going to ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main issues , why everyone -- maybe just the most of the electronic <unk> of <unk> , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> <unk> . a very simple thing .
she has a button . it &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i turn on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you know .
i put my job in 95 lbs .
it &apos;s just simple : every time i jump up to the scale , then you send my data on google , you send my data on google .
and there &apos;s also where you &apos;re going to <unk> my <unk> , so that &apos;s where my favorite <unk> is , and not just at the moment that i &apos;m going to help support , but it &apos;s also a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump out my <unk> and people already talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; to lunch , &quot; to lunch , you &apos;re just trying to <unk> a little salad . &quot;
but that &apos;s the <unk> thing that can happen , because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or patients , for patients , for the <unk> .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they can bring them to play together in any kind of game to control their health care better .
so , next week , this is the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> , you know , you &apos;re an iphone or so <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to their blood pressure and share it with other people , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patient comes into the game , they can &apos;t just take control of control , <unk> on their own ship , but we can help to address health care , and the health care of health care , twice the time that we &apos;re facing the healthcare system , twice , and so on .
they make techniques that are slightly using them , and they &apos;re starting to hug patients in the team .
and that &apos;s how they do these kinds of things , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have the <unk> in our cars .
maybe in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around around the world .
we know one thing that is a gas gas gas .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help to help ?
we have <unk> , and no one knew it .
no one knew where the nearest <unk> <unk> was to find out of that moment .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the netherlands .
we put a website and a group of people asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with you where he &apos;s when he &apos;s got , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed up as a <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> , in the netherlands , were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we &apos;ve created a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone &apos;s collapsing , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can find your <unk> , you can save the next <unk> to save lives .
and we don &apos;t want to just do this as a <unk> , as the product calls itself , but also as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
and we asked our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us help us behave like <unk> to the world bank to breed .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody &apos;s collapsing , it &apos;s your own <unk> or anyone else , you can find that you find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us to help us the world &apos;s world <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or <unk> , just to make sure that the <unk> is still , that the <unk> still is still on his place .
so , please help us do that and try to improve the health of the health , but you &apos;re going to take it to your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to make that we &apos;re forcing to make the environment by doing ...
... it &apos;s a <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh , right .
it &apos;s not going to take it until it &apos;s <unk> .
now -- we can just skip that -- i &apos;m going to skip the video instead of just the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i launched a program to get the stars in technology and getting a year of taking off in a environment that is pretty much everything you really hate , we have them work , we &apos;ve got them working in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little like the <unk> for <unk> .
we choose some fellows we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re going to work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and there were great apps they were doing , they were working with urban employees .
but what you really do is show what is possible to do with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> downtown in the city .
here it looks like he looks after a date , but what he really searches is , somebody who &apos;s <unk> him when it &apos;s <unk> , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> of the <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> .
how did he come to look at this particular kind of thing ?
we had a team of all the fellows in boston in the way that &quot; code for america &quot; program .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> in february .
and they realized that the city never <unk> these fire fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , and he was still something else , and that was the residents that residents were free to <unk> , right front of these parts .
so he did , what would anyone do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you throw it to the <unk> , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al gore .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take somebody away .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic dynamic .
this is a very humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that wrote the fellows last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other <unk> .
it &apos;s going to spread fast .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> town of the city of the city , who has seen that app , not to the snow , but to the people who are <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work work , but people steal the batteries .
and he got the citizen citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the people to clean the <unk> .
and chicago , it &apos;s got to introduce it to the people that people who <unk> the <unk> when it was <unk> .
we know now nine cities that planning planning to exploit this app .
and she &apos;s always distributed organically , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston , for three people and two months .
it was about a way to figure out a way to find out what the right public schools are for their children .
and we told us later that if it was going to take over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
now , there &apos;s a project in the california &apos;s central law , which is the cost of two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this , at every level of government .
so an app which is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread from <unk> , is a kind of shot before the front of the government .
they show how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access to access , that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , they represented a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who are creating the tools that we need to do , to create things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there &apos;s hundreds of people around the country that are up to open and writing , every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful with her , but they don &apos;t complain about them , they fix them .
and these guys know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all get your feelings about politics and the line of <unk> and all the other things that we really adore , is government , in the core words , in the core words , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do in common .
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you &apos;re <unk> about it , because things are changing .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in the change .
and because the government eventually takes their power -- <unk> yourself , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , will affect what this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government , when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , it &apos;s mostly about people &apos;s government to choose people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s been in the community of life , to <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the call call the service for service and information .
you usually get out of your city when you &apos;re <unk> in your city .
if you ever have a chance to work in your <unk> center , like our fellow scott <unk> , as part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all -- you &apos;re going to see that people -- you will see that people , the government , for many different problems , including the government in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he &apos;s typing &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . it starts with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , can you open all the doors in your house and see a lot loud music , and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . give me round scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston , boston has not just a call .
it &apos;s an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very intelligent people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- i got this in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell you if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what &apos;s happening with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott <unk> was to man .
but the <unk> <unk> is all the public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it looked a neighbor .
and the next point we got to get , &quot; i went across there , i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . come alive ? <unk> .
and the <unk> on the site , went home .
good night , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital digital device .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to get into this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk more about a platform for people to help himself and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played here , but the government was played here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have to connect them with government services , but a neighbor &apos;s been a <unk> , but a neighbor &apos;s better better than government services .
if a neighbor &apos;s neighbor helps you , we &apos;re going to draw our communities .
so let &apos;s call the <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think is that government is not the same thing as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is the vote .
how often we chose a political guide -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and we &apos;re going to expect to be the government , and we expect to be our needs , and then not have a lot of changes ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a farther ocean and politics is the top of the ocean .
and what lies below is what we call the bureaucracy .
and we use this word with these <unk> .
but it &apos;s that weird , the thing that we own , and for that we are paying , and we &apos;re going to be able to be something that we &apos;re working on , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think of politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make the bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to be about the machinery of government .
so the <unk> did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned , who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , who wrote an answer to the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not a political active thing that is <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you need to think the enormous challenges that you need to ask .
do we really believe that we need to reach what we need to do without improving the institution that &apos;s all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s got to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible to make the function of government fundamentally in a way that can actually make something happen by society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build things .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with , you know , your voice to see .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight , which is why they &apos;re allowed to talk .
you can make your mind , every channel at every time , and they do it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t take care of your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improves the job of the government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be , you know , a fire hydrant , <unk> , weeds , a trash garbage with a <unk> .
and sure , we have these <unk> <unk> all the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of the government who pay taxes and they receive punished .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re going to improve government , until we &apos;re going to improve the morals .
so the question i &apos;ve all here is : when it comes to you , the big important things we need to do , all together , will be just a lot of voices , or we &apos;re going to be a lot of , a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in the role of explaining to people like wonderful new technologies that are at the rise of being , and i thought , i &apos;m here , because i &apos;m here , i would tell you , and i would try and understand what &apos;s going on , with these incredible <unk> <unk> forward , which is happening that way to keep us up with that .
so i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... if you want to show the slide .
this is a slide that i chose accidentally chosen my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather than the <unk> shape .
this slide shows data from the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of <unk> , compared to the performance of a change .
so the interesting here is that this slide , like many other other , which is so many of the things that we &apos;re in a field is a kind of <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a power of a power of the <unk> .
and this is a novelty , we need to use this type of <unk> curves in the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m talking about here .
so if you could turn the lights back .
another thing a little bit more , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology of the <unk> curves ?
the reason is , if i draw on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say that this is the years , the kind of times of a kind of kind of a kind of technology , and this is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
so they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , then that would be very <unk> very <unk> , in shape a flat line .
but if something happens , it changes the most powerful circumstance in the world , it changes the very <unk> circumstance .
so if the <unk> <unk> would be like the <unk> of the <unk> , we could get <unk> into a taxi and 30 seconds we &apos;d be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not going to be fast .
we &apos;ve never been before that before the <unk> of the <unk> , this kind of exponential growth , which is the scale of the scale of exponentially .
the question i want to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , you can &apos;t go and go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is always forever , and it &apos;s going to evolve as fast as it is now .
there are two ways .
either of you will be a classic <unk> like this , until something completely new , or it will happen .
that &apos;s it in about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
is that really , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re right here in the right right now .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world in a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often myself , is how this new world will be , will be ?
what is this new condition that &apos;s going to take place ?
because the transition transition is very , very confusing to be very confusing in the middle of the inside .
when i was a kid , there was a child in 2000 , and the future was a lot of people talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now , we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize the future still is still in 2000 .
we don &apos;t go beyond that .
so in other words , the future is declining for me , has declined a year since i &apos;ve been on this world .
i think the reason that we &apos;re doing is that there &apos;s something that is underway .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a point of making 30 or 50 years to look at 50 years into the future because everything is so different from the fact that we don &apos;t make sense of a simple <unk> .
so i want to talk about what might be , this transition is that transition that we &apos;re currently in right now .
so to make this , i &apos;m going to talk to you first about some other things that really nothing about technology or computers .
because i think about this really understanding , we need to take one step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and i want to look at this at the <unk> of the life of the earth .
i think the big picture makes sense if you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and we go to a number billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that the chemicals were around , then there &apos;s a pretty good image of how they &apos;re <unk> .
i think there &apos;s also a theories that start to understand how everything happens with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a story about what &apos;s happening to little <unk> <unk> , which is different types of <unk> for chemicals in the other .
some of these <unk> contain a particular combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and to grow .
all the way they were , was to slice up .
these little <unk> were in the sense that they were <unk> .
but these <unk> , not about life in the world &apos;s very , because each one of them was just a little , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time it shared , these are <unk> chemicals in the <unk> of these things .
so every single <unk> was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> grew , which one of the growth of growth had more than others and more and more chemicals and more chemicals from outside and shared faster and divided .
so this is the way that the longer we survive , and it &apos;s <unk> to <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these <unk> is a trick of abstraction , to learn a trick .
in any way , we don &apos;t quite understand , have this <unk> capacity that &apos;s learned to information , information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe for the cell as a information , and in a certain chemical shape , which we call dna .
in other words , you have found in this <unk> , evolutionary way that allowed them to be , <unk> , what they were <unk> , so that this information is stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store information about a number of billions of billions of years where they were born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every living organism is the exact same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re at the time we &apos;re just trying to write the <unk> , even in this code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> that i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of <unk> away .
in fact , what i did is , i &apos;ve made this code , the code is made by the code -- the code is made by a piece of dna , and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written my <unk> .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my favorite , i have enough to have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had a <unk> , i would have written it on a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of the dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , a very interesting step , where things were completely different , and then they started using these cells and share information , so communities were born of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
and this is why the fact that &apos;s the consistency to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how they can stay from penicillin , and they &apos;ve written this information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are becoming <unk> in penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now , this communication allows for the reasons of communities that were in a little boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either have survived them , or they went together , and that meant that when a community had succeeded , all individuals have been repeatedly repeatedly and <unk> the evolution .
so the <unk> is there , where these communities are so close to the community that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a <unk> on the dna .
and the next interesting phase was about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which together as individual organism is acting as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells , brain cells , cells and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the level of evolution was happening , no longer the individual cell was , but the whole <unk> that we call organism .
so the next step was now , within these communities .
the <unk> started abstract information .
and they developed special structures which are not making anything else as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built these <unk> .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures that are responsible for learning to understand and capture information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning happened within the period of life &apos;s lifespan , rather than having this evolutionary amount of time .
so an organism could learn to eat a certain amount of fruit , because she was bad and she made a sick sick , that last time he ate it .
this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas these hundreds of thousands of years were needed , because this information had learned from the individuals that died of these ancient individuals , which was not there to be there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> system with this particular <unk> , because evolution could now take within a individual .
it could take place within a time .
what happened then , the individual organisms that happened to be able to communicate with each other .
so , as an example , the <unk> version of this <unk> is the human language is the human language .
but it &apos;s a rather amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically giving <unk> sounds , in the hope of a similar word in your head , which is a kind of <unk> idea in your head that has a resemblance to me with the original idea .
so we take a little complicated , and it &apos;s a sequence of sound , and it &apos;s a sequence of sound , and creating something very complicated in the minds of others .
so this allows us to work again as a physical organism .
and what we actually did is we have to be , we &apos;ve been abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that we &apos;ve gone through <unk> -- the abstraction of our methods , how we capture data , is process .
so the invention of the speech , for example , was a little step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on , are all the <unk> mechanisms that we built in our community to keep this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also , you can also get to develop faster than we were .
so nowadays , evolution is happening in the number of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little <unk> little <unk> where he showed a little evolution in the <unk> , right in front of your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again .
the first steps of the story i told you about , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , as the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and the next steps , how electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself and becomes so , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- when something <unk> its <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster changes it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here is this <unk> curve .
we see the process that are feeding itself .
i live professionally , i know , i know , i &apos;m using the mechanism i use using computers to build computer computers , not using the recently that i &apos;ve been using , without the recently that have been done .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design for me to design these in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers are doing , and what designers do is , we think of a certain amount of <unk> , <unk> , and the machine does that , and that &apos;s what makes our capabilities more than we could ever do it .
and it &apos;s partly doing the techniques that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a way that &apos;s particularly interesting is , and what i &apos;ve used recently is used in a very last time , evolution itself .
and we install a <unk> machine in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
so to call an example in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , <unk> , can be a hundred million sequences of instructions .
now , please now take all this random instructions , all the programs , and then finally , you know , i &apos;m going to the ones that are going on my goals . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m going to ask what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to have a number of numbers that i used to have , that &apos;s a simple example of what i used to do .
so , i think , sort of , the <unk> programs that can be numbers .
of course , the chance of chosen to be elected , they &apos;re very small , they &apos;re just going to be a number of the instructions , so you don &apos;t think of the instructions in fact , you &apos;re not going to actually do the instructions .
but one of those things might be very lucky two numbers into the right .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computer , take the same 10 percent of the sequences that are going to come in the next .
and it &apos;s got the rest , <unk> the rest .
now , all the <unk> <unk> that have the numbers of the best <unk> .
and that &apos;s a method of the <unk> , analogous to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they &apos;re making children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the kids are <unk> the attributes of the <unk> of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that were created by combinations of programs that come into the trials of the trials than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> again .
now , you don &apos;t want some mutations .
and then we try to do this with another generation .
all these generations require a few milliseconds .
and so i can run evolution over millions of years of the computer in a few minutes , or in more complex cases , and in more complex cases .
so , finally , i get the programs to make the numbers perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s persistent , weird programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that are done .
because their lives depended on it , if they were doing the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , <unk> a card <unk> and says , &quot; oh , look . look at this .
there &apos;s this plane , &quot; the plane consists of <unk> <unk> , which together work to make your flight safer . &quot; don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t optimal when it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computer computers , which is a process that &apos;s different from the classical engineering process .
and he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the usual methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
so <unk> <unk> technology &apos;s technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we can do these processes even faster .
so it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding themselves by themselves .
we raise .
we &apos;re at a point where we &apos;ve evolved to have evolved as a <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t turn the <unk> , what we &apos;re actually creating at the order of the hell .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think that after us , after us .
i think it &apos;s very much <unk> of us to say that we &apos;re the product of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s going to happen next .
now , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m going to hear i &apos;m listening to this , before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story starts in a rajasthan hall , two years ago , about two years ago .
i was under the park in the desert with <unk> ali .
we talked about it that hasn &apos;t changed anything since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel to the back , we went to a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do that with airplanes .
then at the time , when the big indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a bow to the floor and water .
now we &apos;re going to do that with <unk> and machines .
and we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i was a little scared about technology .
it was scared i was scared of the ability to get the <unk> , and i can tweet the <unk> , and without tweet my friends .
i thought that technology should be done , not kill as possible .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and to pictures in my idea .
i was like , as we were taking our fancy clocks , and we were getting to dream of the cameras .
they were holding us by being inspired .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to allow magic to kill .
so , at 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling the way that we connect to the world .
it can know how we keep it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
that always used to have more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to be <unk> , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box ... &quot; i &apos;m writing my name . &quot;
and i &apos;ll get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows , &quot; the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
so the child in me is really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean a magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we had all of the children .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i always thought very exciting .
so you have to drop the ipad out here and the metal <unk> .
and the light bulb is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can stick in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s a book and every world that i &apos;m going to get a little <unk> here to draw here the magic device in the device .
and this is a map .
<unk> had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also a different point of the book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
it &apos;s also important to create something that is <unk> , but also , it &apos;s very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of the <unk> and <unk> , but how many people are outside india , who &apos;s the indian colleagues who are <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back , in a more contemporary history of children .
a story that &apos;s going to have new issues , like the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem of last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , in their office , on their computers , without a long time .
but now , using mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you need to go out and you &apos;re going to get out of the camera image of the ipads image .
as a child , i had some collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> &apos;s <unk> . you need to go out to make a photograph of a flower and tag on a photograph .
in another chapter you have to tag a piece of <unk> <unk> and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the image of a tennis player and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually sampled .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of making magic , and connect to connect with each other .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction with the video of the ipads and the <unk> , and through <unk> &apos;s reality , it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> to the house .
and in one spot , the screen is going to stick with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , you remove the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where nature &apos;s forces come into and come in and the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time in <unk> , jails or <unk> .
i spend most of my time , the most vulnerable thing in the <unk> and in places that there are very much <unk> .
here &apos;s ted to be able to see and listen to how powerful that is , i &apos;ve given me very much force .
in the short time , here &apos;s been a clear thing : ted has a identity .
you can tell things that have influence the world .
and sometimes when you get something about ted , it gets a meaning and force that it wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of one person is meaning , but the words of a dedicated learner are meaningful , and they &apos;re meaningful , for the words of a dedicated .
as a physician , you can do good , as a physician , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned my grandmother &apos;s lesson .
i was big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who became dominated by a <unk> <unk> , and this was my grandmother &apos;s grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had to impact .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia than slave slaves .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery in the world is very powerful .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and i was <unk> myself .
she pushed me so that i could barely breathe , i &apos;d let me breathe .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me , and she said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , i said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , let me give me a calm .
and she was something that made you just wanted to be in her face .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins walked around .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine , i woke up one morning and i went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the <unk> and <unk> me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at them and smiled , but she looked very serious .
that went so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came over and came over to me . she took me to go and said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember this as though it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me out to go outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you need to promise you , you know , you &apos;re not <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat me down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to watch you know . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i will never forget that .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise to me just three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first of all , i &apos;m going to love you to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you need to promise to promise you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
i &apos;m committing my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next thing , i &apos;m going to do you will be right . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing , the right thing to do . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise is &quot; is you never going to be drinking alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a half older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with his sister and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we just <unk> it as it &apos;s like the other .
then he took a drink beer and he offered my sister and she assumed , and then they offered me one to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . i mean , i &apos;m not . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do you make it , you know , you do whatever we do .
i had what , your sister had , you know , <unk> a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . power is just one . &quot; just power . &quot;
my brother &apos;s kind of staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , <unk> . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t do anything about the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother &apos;s all the time that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to admit something .
i probably wouldn &apos;t do that .
this is perhaps <unk> publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i <unk> , i &apos;m never having to drink one drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a <unk> . i say , because identity is power .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people to tell us things that they didn &apos;t think of .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re just special .
my grandfather was during prison in prison prison .
my uncle died in <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these issues were being , we would have to take care of .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
and then , 1972 , 300,000 people in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are released on the room or with <unk> <unk> .
i think , in my mind , <unk> <unk> .
in socially weak and black sharing of the population of despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black black is between 18 and 30 is in prison , in the prison , or <unk> , or <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country , from los angeles , in baltimore , in switzerland , are 50 to 60 percent of the black men in prison , in prison , in prison , or <unk> , or on the room , or <unk> .
and our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also <unk> .
we have a <unk> , a <unk> that they &apos;re getting much better , if they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor as poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , it affects the result .
but still , we seem to be satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some <unk> developments .
my home is , in the front of alabama , if you &apos;re sentencing to the <unk> , if you &apos;re doomed .
here in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population increases increases in their whaling levels .
we <unk> that in 10 years the percentage of the civic <unk> of the civic <unk> is going to be high as before the <unk> of the <unk> .
silence is <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the child &apos;s children &apos;s <unk> children in prison .
in this country , there is a lot of children in our country , <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we think because we &apos;ve taught it that the real question is : is a man who earns to die of dying crimes ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : anybody deserves a crime person , but do we earned it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by accident .
and on nine people we &apos;ve gotten to <unk> one , one that we &apos;ve gotten to <unk> for innocent , who was <unk> and death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we &apos;d never leave somebody with a plane , if for nine planes , the <unk> , one <unk> .
but somehow we &apos;re creating it , we &apos;re <unk> from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m <unk> my students &apos; classic . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time , the time against the end of the world , until the beginning of the world war war .
we don &apos;t really know about it much .
but for the african-american , the african-american in this country was a time .
in many places , people were to have scared of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
and these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr , <unk> , they &apos;re talking about talks , they say they &apos;re supposed to stop saying that we should have to stop the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> would be <unk> and apartheid .
and yet , there are a dynamics in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what &apos;s meaning our actions in the context .
we &apos;re doing all the time .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to be able to approach the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> doesn &apos;t overcome the willingness without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , it was the willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been held some talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly disturbing , you know , you &apos;re talking to hear . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death .
and of course , it can never give you more in germany . &quot;
it was a little silence . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to do that we have to do the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously , and in particular people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like that , in a world that &apos;s <unk> in the german , in which the german state , especially , if there was a lot of jews , a lot of jews were .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re going to see people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of being convicted , 11 times higher , when the victim is black , and the victim is 22 , and the victim is 22 times , in the world , in the same states , in the same states , in the same states , in the same states , in the same states , in the same states , in the same states , in the same
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these hard issues , these difficult issues are also being affected and wonderful things also .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;m very important to combine both .
because we &apos;re going to talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to make in a complex world .
for me , it &apos;s going to be able to make time and talk about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , who never be at ted .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to think of all the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do this . so we &apos;re as rational as we estimate , as we estimate .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming out of our heads .
they come out of ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> that i think is that it &apos;s not just open to us , not just to be open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , who &apos;s great <unk> politicians , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do everything . but what we needed was , we were most needed , hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be in places like to be in places like <unk> places .
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is that the <unk> must be engaged in their own .
there &apos;s no way of technology and design that allows us to be fully human and as long as we can &apos;t be able to see the eyes and <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is much more than when we &apos;re not about to do it .
she &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege , pink parks to meet .
and again , the woman park came back again , where they <unk> two of their oldest friends , including these elders , <unk> <unk> , who had created the <unk> , and virginia <unk> , who had a <unk> , whose husband <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women are made up and they were just a way of a grandmother .
and then , the woman rang and then called me , &quot; <unk> , woman park comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to listen to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and listened to just .
it &apos;s always been inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i sat there and listened to these women , and after a few hours turned around to me , and he said , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the ultimate role for the same is right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put injustice on injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were innocent convicted .
we want to fight the bias and fight discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to <unk> <unk> <unk> without any time for children .
we want to do something against the death of the death .
we want to get the number of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and she looked at me and she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , she was <unk> himself , put a fingers on my face , and she said , &quot; and therefore , you must be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to have to make sense of these challenges : these problems , this is sorry .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i &apos;ve learned in my work quite simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that &apos;s all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if someone is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes a little bit of it , it doesn &apos;t just just a burglar block .
even who kills somebody &apos;s not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s because there &apos;s a basic dignity that has to respect the law .
i think that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that &apos;s the opposite places of poverty , of course , of poverty .
and i think i think that although it &apos;s so dramatic , so inspiring and inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured on our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds .
and ultimately , a society is not measured how they got their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to grasp the real amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story .
sometimes i urge to very much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas , we &apos;re going to predict these ideas , very important way .
i <unk> these children who were very <unk> <unk> .
i go to <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s what &apos;s supposed to be in a lunatic court .
then i ask myself : how could that happen ?
how can a judge someone is into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long at night , and i thought , my god , if a judge could turn into something else , he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should be what you want .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more well , i started working on a fight .
i had a <unk> , poor young young boy as a client .
and i started to fight with this . the headline was , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black efforts like a privileged to treat white <unk> . &quot;
in my hometown , i explained that failure of the <unk> and the police and <unk> to be involved .
there was a crazy line line about that country in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> .
and the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was this crazy <unk> , just to actually mention this crazy thing or in fact .
and my horror and i didn &apos;t just write it , but also sent to court .
a few months , and i went to forget everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to put in the dish , and i &apos;m going to give you the crazy case .
i got the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i was driving for the dish .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
i ended up out of my car , and i went to the <unk> center for the dish .
when i was the staircase on the court of the court , there was an elderly , black man who was willing to pay the officer in the court .
when he saw me , he came up to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and i <unk> myself .
then he put into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was me force .
it &apos;s very deeply <unk> in me , identity , identity , the ability to contribute each one , to a sense of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
and as soon as the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , do you have this crazy fight ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people went in , just because they were angry , they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry , that we were angry talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the job that they go and down .
he looked back through the window , and i could hear the whole <unk> .
he went on and off .
finally , this older woman was a very <unk> black man in the <unk> and sat straight down , almost in the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
and while the break came in , a <unk> in the <unk> was felt that the <unk> was the <unk> .
this <unk> ran across the older black black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here , and he &apos;s got me to tell this young man , don &apos;t give you the goal . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have figured out that the moral pendulum of the universe is far away , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
we &apos;re not fully being completely designed as humans as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that &apos;s our survival of all the lives that are living every single connected .
that we have visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity to connect with humanity , mercy , mercy and justice .
and especially , i want to just see those of you who are just saying , just don &apos;t , don &apos;t you don &apos;t do the goal . don &apos;t give you .
you &apos;ve got to see this audience , this community , and they heard a obvious wish to help them do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s all sorts of possibilities .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s about to make a effort in the fact that it &apos;s actually a struggle to do something , something from the <unk> of the punishment .
here , california , for example , is going to be a billion dollars for the death of a death penalty company for the death penalty season .
and yet , 85 percent of all the <unk> doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
56 percent of all the court won &apos;t come in front of court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this is <unk> that will propose money in more affordable and safety .
i think there are ways of opportunities .
over the last three decades , the u.s. health industry has declined a major area in america .
this is a lot of the fact that they &apos;re asked to <unk> the elevated .
what would you tell someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really be in class in class of the class .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers are high numbers in the prisoner .
we &apos;ve got <unk> of the rhetoric of the rhetoric .
now we have <unk> <unk> , people who bring people to the <unk> , for a <unk> , for the theft of the theft , rather than you force them to give the people to give the victims of the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people get victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current response to anyone &apos;s helping anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to do .
<unk> , they really have a string of <unk> .
they &apos;re inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin is a death of death , an increased <unk> .
2 : famine : three : o.c. <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
4 : malignant <unk> : dangerous <unk> .
six : social <unk> : 65 dead .
8 : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . tornado .
recession : <unk> . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a couple of the snippets that i collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years . or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are just to give these subjects to attention .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses , our senses , can ever be able to process much more information than our brain .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first is the first spacecraft to all the information that &apos;s going to be part of the information , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our system of the system , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> the whole information on the search for any of the <unk> of risk in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s going to be very true .
now with all of our digital devices that seven days , 24 hours a day , 24 / 7 , is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic are , we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always going to be worse .
but it &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress is accelerating the last century , that we &apos;ve made a series of forces that are going to be able to make us in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , <unk> , water , <unk> -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as people are much better at the time , problems of problems , but they &apos;re going to get over to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done , what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can have the development of the development .
over the last hundred years , the average lifespan is more than doubled , which is <unk> <unk> , the population is <unk> .
child mortality has grown a tenth rate .
and then comes the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communication costs to have a <unk> .
steve pinker showed us that we live in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of 25 percent 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re going to increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
consider that a lot of americans who live under the poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , televisions , mobile , <unk> , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , could never have that <unk> .
the basis of a lot of these kinds of technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is technology to technology , the curved world is great , and the <unk> 12 , the <unk> 12 of the year , and the <unk> 12 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone takes a million times less than less and more than a supercomputer is faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
that &apos;s moore &apos;s law last year .
notice two things at that curve .
first , how smooth it is -- in good as good as a good , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of a faster computers , making a <unk> computer .
she doesn &apos;t slow for any of our big problems .
and also , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left , you &apos;re going up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all the available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends are doing with a while in a whirlwind called sensors , and we <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , that enable you to enter the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk> medicine , <unk>
how many of you have a victory of <unk> schrödinger in &quot; jeopardy ? &quot;
that was a big big .
i have the newspapers , and i &apos;ve looked at the <unk> headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human opponents . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy &quot; is not simple .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of each owner would be given to each other owners of one another .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i was here at ted , and i &apos;m here at ted university university .
we bring our students all these technologies , with focused on how this is used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies and creating products and services within a decade , to make a living life of billions of people .
think about it , a group of students today can affect life from billions of people .
30 years ago , this was a ridiculous conflict .
now we can have done dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think about creating , i don &apos;t mean to make a living , i don &apos;t mean a living luxury for everybody on the planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about <unk> goods to create goods .
but scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 1700s .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> , however , got <unk> .
aluminum was at that time the most precious metal of the planet , more frequently than gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome of the nerve was made of aluminum .
although , aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is , it &apos;s not as a pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the <unk> developed and made it so cheap that we use it to use our <unk> .
so let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of energy &apos;s energy &apos;s energy &apos;s energy than we &apos;re using a year .
16 <unk> energy consumption will all <unk> for the world &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce cost to 50 percent of the <unk> in india -- <unk> rupees , versus 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy is about 50 percent of the year .
last month , this is a study that shows that until the end of the decade , the <unk> in the sunny parts of the u.s. at the u.s. is going to cost to 15 cents a national average of average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water in the abundance of abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> of 1990 , when it was <unk> , back in the earth , rotated , in the earth ?
he took a famous picture . how did it be ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live in a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s at 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saline water , two percent of the water , and we &apos;re fighting around , for example , there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> <unk> on the way .
and from a discussion morning , dean <unk> , a minister of the <unk> , i want to share with you , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the <unk> , and from many of you may have heard . it &apos;s the size of a <unk> <unk> .
it can create thousands of gallons of clean water water per day -- if the water , polluted water , latrine , <unk> water , and all that you &apos;re doing less than two cents per gallon .
the head of coca-cola has just <unk> , a large <unk> of <unk> in the developing world .
and if all you go well , and i &apos;m very confident , and then a confident , then a variety of technologies will apply globally to apply to the whole planet .
this is <unk> innovation that &apos;s there today .
and we &apos;ve seen this as mobile phones .
you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get 70 percent of the mobile phone &apos;s mobile phone in developing countries to end up in the end of 2013 .
consider that a <unk> cell phone with a cellphone in the middle of kenya was a better <unk> than president reagan is 25 years old .
and if you look at google balloons , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton was 15 years ago .
they live in a world that information and communication has been <unk> , how no one ever could ever have .
and it &apos;s still better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries and the picture , all of the books , and the medical diagnostics -- are literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of it is perhaps what we expected to do in the health .
last month i had the pleasure to call the <unk> 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize prize by the time .
so we &apos;re asking teams around the world , and we &apos;re making all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device that you &apos;re using , because it &apos;s <unk> , you can test your <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> physicians .
so , imagine that this device is going to be , in a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device was a <unk> or <unk> sequenced , it &apos;s not known , it &apos;s got the health of the health care system and prevents a pandemic before you released .
but now , the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just got the <unk> .
and by the way , the biggest <unk> of the population is a better upbringing and food around the world .
in 2010 , we had two billion people living online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to move forward to two billion <unk> .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , are the global communication coming to the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are you desire ?
and instead of the <unk> gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the pack of the <unk> , and they &apos;re better trained by the <unk> , and thereby using the opportunity to use 3d printers and <unk> in the way that much more productive .
so what can three billion growing up , healthy , intellectual , productive members of the world ?
now , what would it be with a set of new , never before <unk> .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever you &apos;re having , a voice to make sense to make sense of its attention and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people bring ?
how would it be with <unk> , which we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned from x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are motivated to create extraordinary things that could create large companies and government governments to have just done in the past .
i want to close with a story that has really excited me .
there &apos;s a program that some of you know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids , how the protein will evolve .
and the way we can predict the structure , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so , this is a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was done by professors and on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that nowadays the human landscape is better than the best supercomputer .
and when those people came and looked at who &apos;s the best <unk> of the world , it was no <unk> , and he was a woman who was in england , manchester , a woman who was working on the day of the <unk> in a <unk> and night at night .
ladies and gentlemen , which is what i trust in our future is the fact that we have more power to be more than individuals to ask us to ask ourselves the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools using exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do that , what needed is needed .
we &apos;re expecting a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something to be a <unk> piece of culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting with a medical medical school , and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business as i could give it to give up a chunk of my own <unk> <unk> to enable you .
but before i &apos;m going to talk to the actual theme of my presentation , let &apos;s start with a little baseball baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re very close to the <unk> and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears to be soon and turns around , and to make these great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of the statistics i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 , if a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player &apos;s player &apos;s going to be three of the 10 .
that means that beat the ball into the <unk> , it &apos;s coming up , it &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball up for the first base , it &apos;s not going to be in the street .
three out 10 .
you know , you call a <unk> <unk> on baseball called baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is somebody &apos;s four of 10 hits the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player who met the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> season .
so let &apos;s take back to my world in medicine , where i &apos;m a few more comfortable , i might feel a few more comfortable , or maybe a little bit of probably i &apos;ve talked about it .
suppose you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a <unk> cluster , which is <unk> 400 times in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine if they live in a certain remote area , and you &apos;ve got a beloved person with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> , whose <unk> is in 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s much better . it &apos;s a lot better than the <unk> branch .
and she &apos;s punching a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or doctor should be .
what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re going to be able to take each of them , including the world , to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one is going to be thinking about the details of how to be done .
and that &apos;s the news i took in medical school .
i was a <unk> student .
in high school , a <unk> <unk> said that brian <unk> was learning for a <unk> .
and it was also .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> at the nurses in the toronto , and the <unk> hospital , <unk> of here .
i learned everything .
in my hometown , i learned the origins and the <unk> and the tail every branch of one of the <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i actually knew the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed off with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical center with the impression that i knew everything , and it knew , and at least as much as possible , i knew that i was immune to the <unk> of mistakes that i think is that i &apos;m immune to make it mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met a little printer , i met a desktop printer .
i was a <unk> in toronto here in toronto , and i was brought a woman to the clinic who was brought to me in the clinic .
at that point , i was the <unk> layer of service in the service service .
and it was my assignment when the <unk> was looking for the <unk> of advice to investigate the <unk> .
and feedback feedback to my <unk> .
i looked at a <unk> printer and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her to <unk> sounds sound .
and when i <unk> her chest <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under heart failure .
that &apos;s a condition in the heart , instead of putting the entire blood down , and it &apos;s a part of the blood blood in the lungs , and then filling it up , and therefore the <unk> came .
and that was not a hard to <unk> .
i made them and i made it up .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call <unk> , water pills , so they <unk> the liquid .
and over a period of a year and a half hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made that first mistake ; i sent her home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home with my <unk> without my favorite .
i didn &apos;t take on the fact , and i did what i should have had , what would be a call in my <unk> , so that he was a chance to have a chance to make a sense of a sense .
and he was known she would have been able to put additional information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed as well as well as being able to take responsibility , so i would be able to make my patients to make him contact with the patient without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home , i <unk> a little voice in my head , i was a <unk> voice to tell me , &quot; satan , not good idea . &quot;
in fact , i was really struck by the <unk> that i asked was the nurse , who was a <unk> printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and i said , in <unk> , i think , &quot; sure , i &apos;ll go . &quot;
i remember it as being written on it last yesterday .
so i went to <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and brought her home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , i had this <unk> feeling in my belly .
but i worked on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the ward , and i went to the parking lot to the car in the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t make it .
i went home my way home my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen her wife , but another three words of mine , and these three words are terrified of most <unk> , most of the most <unk> i know .
other medical professionals , but the <unk> <unk> is particularly particularly , because we just see the patient &apos;s patient .
so three words are : remember ?
&quot; recall yourself , you know the patient you would have ? &quot;
i asked the nurse <unk> .
so , &quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she got to home her home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 , they took her back to the <unk> with a blood blood pressure .
she barely breathe , and blue <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they <unk> them at the <unk> .
i was shocked , and to the inner <unk> .
and i went through these rollercoaster , because she came to the <unk> in the <unk> and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days realized that she never would have to draw again .
she had no <unk> <unk> .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they decided to be the <unk> .
the day , she <unk> her -- a woman , a woman , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you don &apos;t forget the names of the people who never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next weeks i did , i &apos;m going to be aware of the first time , i learned the sick of the ignorance of shame -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you don &apos;t talk about the colleagues .
you know all the healthy shame , if you give a mystery of your best friend , although this one on <unk> &apos;s <unk> , and you get it , and you get the best friend to come and get a terrible discussion , and you <unk> it in the end , however you can never make a mistake .
if you do <unk> , and you never make the mistake again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the most unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the <unk> one in the <unk> .
it &apos;s the one that says that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing is not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but it &apos;s not bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t my <unk> for my <unk> , he was very gentle .
he was talking about the family , and i &apos;m sure he had <unk> the <unk> and i &apos;m sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
but i asked myself , i ask these questions .
why did i not ask the <unk> ? why am i going to home home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why am i left in medicine ?
but slowly it &apos;s got it .
i started feeling better .
and then a day of a day , there was a hole in the clouds and collapsed , and i could tell myself , i can feel better , i can feel better .
and i was with me , if i was growing up my efforts to the perfect level , and never again again a mistake that could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened .
two years later , i had service service in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i was <unk> for 25 years old <unk> to <unk> .
it was a lot of us , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed up his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next year and my <unk> asked me to write my office in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out that he was a <unk> .
he had an potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not a infection of the <unk> , but it &apos;s caused the <unk> of the <unk> .
luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and he recovered a few days later .
and i went again through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , and i was raised , and i went to work on the work until it happened again and again .
in a <unk> , i have a <unk> bug .
there &apos;s a lot of a lot of things that you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients a night .
in these cases , i didn &apos;t stop at home , and there were no standard of any of her treatment .
i thought he had <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidney , when it was a <unk> , my colleague , my colleague , he put a <unk> <unk> in the lower sector , and called the <unk> <unk> .
the other one was very diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked my colleagues to evaluate him as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was a <unk> at the bottom of the lower sector , he phoned the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was good at them .
both of these cases , i <unk> myself .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was done in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues saying , but there &apos;s a total nonsense .
some of my favorite students had happened in the last five years .
alone , silence and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not close to my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the silent voice that &apos;s really going to find what &apos;s happened , how can i share my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make those same ?
if i had a room -- like , just like , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of somebody &apos;s been talking about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yes , you &apos;re going to be a cocktail party and you heard about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t hear somebody else you hear about your own mistakes .
if i had a full of colleagues with colleagues and to ask her to tell her immediate activity and tell them what i was telling you , i would not be able to do the end of the second story , before they really would be uncomfortable with me , you know , somebody would go on the subject , and you &apos;d get the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues know that a <unk> <unk> in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , then she would believe me to look at the wrong .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who are not making . those who are not making <unk> and the <unk> , which with the bad results , and the good results .
it &apos;s almost a ideological reaction to attack the people that attack .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones that we &apos;re doing , the mistakes are going to be a safe system .
but there are two problems that are happening .
in my approximately 20 years of the medical journal and journalism , i have a personal medical trial for medical error and wrong treatments to me , so i wrote to learn everything for my first article , which i wrote for the toronto , &quot; white <unk> , black art , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we work in a system where we &apos;re going to make mistakes in a day where one of 10 <unk> is either wrong or wrong , in the <unk> forever , and the more and more and more and more and the devastation or dead .
in this state , around <unk> canadians , <unk> <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has been the number of 100,000 .
both are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and is the <unk> .
in a <unk> where medical knowledge , every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with them .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own an cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a patient with chest chest .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and give it a light , and suddenly the story is <unk> and suddenly the story of contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are no cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all the time that are put in action .
so if you take the system that &apos;s system , how i was taught , and all of the <unk> <unk> gets edited , then at the end of nobody else left .
and you know the <unk> people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each other from the <unk> to the <unk> , &quot; which is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and then i show you with the microphone . &quot;
and then you have the lens , they &apos;re just going to be <unk> and look down and <unk> , and they &apos;re going to tell you to tell her stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you &apos;re being in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physician .
the newly <unk> doctor is a person , knowing his humanity , pay it to make it not proud of it , but it &apos;s going to take something from you to learn so that it &apos;s passed on to be passed .
she shares her experiences with other experiences .
they supported to talk about others from their mistakes .
and they basically show the mistakes that they &apos;re not in order to be <unk> , but in a <unk> , supportive , the way that all benefit is .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes people in life , and if that &apos;s what people do with life , then people do even mistakes .
so that the system that &apos;s creating is creating a <unk> device that makes it easier to make sense of the people that are inevitably inevitably to make , and it &apos;s also allowing loving spaces to create , and that &apos;s actually being <unk> , and it &apos;s actually being rewarding , and that &apos;s what makes the mistakes that are going to make the mistakes and the <unk> of these .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the newly <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best best to learn it from other people to give it other .
i don &apos;t know what they hold me , but i can live .
let me wrap up with three words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can tell this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , you know , he was here .
you may think that he &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as a very common &quot; medium . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
until the 1980s , it was <unk> in a great way .
now he &apos;s <unk> species .
this story is , we &apos;ve heard many times the galapagos or in other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still get to the galapagos .
we still think that we &apos;re originally .
the <unk> described them still as pristine .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is to give another concept , which is to show you , shows .
because i was experienced , when i was in 1971 a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad <unk> and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really get out of it .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon from <unk> and some pair of mangroves .
there was <unk> <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishers lived well , and they were doing <unk> good at ghana .
when i got 27 years later , the fish was falling down by its height .
and the other hundred is about five centimeters .
they were genetically engineered .
they were still fish .
people were always happy .
and the fish also had the fortune to be there .
so it &apos;s not changing , and yet it has changed everything .
my third story , i told my <unk> , is the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more early on the 1960s -- <unk> europe &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> countries that were already <unk> 100,000 of the industrial ship that was quite ugly .
i was driving this , and we made it all the southern tropical sea , and particularly in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the largest part of the fish that little dots on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
so basically , the bottom of the sea , and then became <unk> .
these images are exceptional , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you will have a survey , and then it starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is it &apos;s going to change . in this case -- a hard reason , or soft corals will shake dung .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
they want to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of rubble of shriram can displace them , if you drive into spaces , which is never going to be <unk> .
but it &apos;s not going to documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> , and we don &apos;t have to remember what was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number number of <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
it &apos;s changing the time . it &apos;s changing because people are very , of course , they &apos;re all actions .
every generation looks at the images that they &apos;re being driven by the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and everything .
the difference is , what &apos;s a loss .
but they &apos;re not taking the previous losses .
it can give you a sequence of changes .
and at the end , you just want to get the most dramatic remains .
right now , is the biggest thing now , is our goal .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are gone , they &apos;re not more like they were .
you could think that the problem was coming up , that when they lived in <unk> societies , they were killing animals and they were just being aware after a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , an animal that was very often rare , it &apos;s rare before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose any common animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a big loss .
and the time we focus on the big animals and the sea is the big fish .
they &apos;re less rare because we &apos;re catching them .
and at the time , there &apos;s little fish left up and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is why people are willing to accept that .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people will say , scientists , saying it was really different .
they &apos;re going to tell it because the evidence , as they &apos;re in a previous shape , are not like the evidence to be <unk> .
so , for example , the anecdote that the report of a <unk> is that the report of a <unk> device is used to be used , not being used , or not <unk> , because not the scientific , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t dare to dare the sources of the past .
this is the very large role that can play a <unk> game .
because through marine trials , we &apos;re basically asking the past .
we &apos;re asking the past to come back , which people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> changes and are very low .
so the people who can see the <unk> <unk> and the one of the things that enabled it to <unk> your <unk> .
what &apos;s the people that &apos;s not possible for that , because they have no access to -- people have no access to the people in the midwest ?
here , i think , i think the arts and the film might fill the gap , and the simulation of the simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> are remind you of &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think people &apos;s being touched by why people were being touched by this -- except from the <unk> , why were they touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> that went in a way that was lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one that i &apos;m going to do is cameron of cameron is spinning down .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , you had to be , if you had a typewriter , it was to register .
they also had to be a leaf called <unk> .
the reason for this is : the government could get back to the fact where they came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could find the <unk> of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , like anyone could do something like this , and how much that would be the free of the speech .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re now , in 2011 , 2011 , a new <unk> of the leading <unk> and a page of print , then this page light colors on every page , into a pattern that &apos;s actually <unk> to her and her printer , and <unk> it &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example of what our own governments of government are the technology against us , the citizens , using the citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing world <unk> .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s happening in the world , we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people make money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several cases of <unk> cases , <unk> , which money makes their money from the attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on .
these guys are online to wealth , but they &apos;ve been illegal , using <unk> , using <unk> money from our <unk> , while we &apos;re going to do our <unk> , or <unk> , which is <unk> our <unk> at the keyboard .
the u.s. intelligence agency <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and on this account of <unk> , <unk> million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. <unk> himself is on foot feet , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today &apos;s more likely to be a <unk> of being a <unk> , than an <unk> in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just getting worse .
in the future , most crimes are going online .
the second second we can see now is not motivated by cash .
they &apos;re <unk> by another thing -- the vietnam , or by the audience , or by your audience .
groups of the last 12 months , and they &apos;re moving to one of the last 12 months , and they become a <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are working in the money because of <unk> , like anonymous , but the last group are , nations are empowered , governments that are the attacks of the attacks .
there are cases of being on , like the <unk> .
it shows a great paradigm , what happens when governments are attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- or was it .
last autumn , it had to be <unk> in <unk> because <unk> was hacked .
somebody was used and had the system <unk> .
and last week in one meeting , i asked a <unk> student , i asked one of the senior members of this group , whether it &apos;s possible to possible that because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row of these things ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a little bit of a time you need to have a website with <unk> , with <unk> of <unk> , for example .
now we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly widely distributed in <unk> states like <unk> , because they &apos;re using the <unk> of foreign manhood like gmail , because they can &apos;t be engaged in their <unk> .
but can you , if you can imagine a foreign battle .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> video .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the trap of the <unk> .
what does it like to do with the arab spring and things that happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the <unk> in april of 2011 , the headquarters in the april of egyptian <unk> . and what they did was a lot of records .
in this files , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and there was a <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> company that &apos;s been sold by egyptian government to which they were -- in very large framework -- all the communication of egyptian citizens could capture .
they had this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so governments governments governments governments with <unk> governments with <unk> , so that &apos;s how to do their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , the so-called <unk> of the so-called <unk> was used to be used by german <unk> to <unk> her own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , you will be pretty safety your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet on .
they use devices like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> <unk> , which allows you to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , and collect their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious response of people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really matter because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has got to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , 2011 , 2011 , our governments may be trust , but every right , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and trust we , trust , we trust each future , a government , which we might have , in 50 years , we might have come in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to have to have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem weird , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> and <unk> a simple idea : <unk> <unk> with a concrete group that fit .
<unk> were very fast the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they gave us to build things that were larger than we were , building bridges , a stone .
essentially , the <unk> was the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego lego came out of this .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> . &quot;
and within a few years , lego , lego in every household one household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced by a 400 stones -- or 75 stones for every person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have an engineer to be nice to beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego lego made it for all possible .
lego lego has basically the <unk> of the world &apos;s building in the building , and i took a block of a building block for our imagination .
in the same year , in the same year , at the bell labs , the next revolution announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that was a world of <unk> , <unk> building building blocks of a world that was interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build much more complex , more complex loops , a stone .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is <unk> , and therefore i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea , how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> is electronic <unk> , which have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t sit it wrong .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a solar panel , blue is the <unk> , pink is wires and orange .
so all you need to do is connect a blue and a green one and you can build them very quickly , and they &apos;re very much fast .
they add a blue one in the green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between them , and they made a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> <unk> that is here , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they made a little <unk> .
and put these <unk> on an extra effect on a little bit , and they made an <unk> .
i will stop that .
and the simple thing is , the simple thing is , is actually <unk> , actually , is quite powerful .
instead of having to program , <unk> , or <unk> , allows them to use simple , intuitive gestures , to code gestures .
so to slow down the way that &apos;s flashing , or slow , just simply , it &apos;s just the button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve <unk> <unk> in children and you can see them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is how they start to understand the electronics that surround them in the world and not learn to school .
like , for example , a <unk> device works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or like the ipod to respond to the touch .
we also have <unk> <unk> .
so , for example , designers with no experience in electronic things that started to play with more than material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water water , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we brought <unk> to risd , and gave them some of the designers that have no more technical experience -- just packed and paper -- &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh , who is afraid in the darkness .
for those <unk> , <unk> , another material , was just a little material .
and we want to make this stuff for everyone .
so , open-source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> of it , and you can make them .
we want the world to encourage the inventors of the creators , the inventors of the <unk> , because the world we live , the interactive world , is we heard .
so , pull them , pull them up .
thank you .
