now why does this matter for the human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the <unk> of the dolphins of the <unk> bay .
and i remember my desk sitting on my desk , and i thought , &quot; i know it . what a great scientific discovery . &quot; but it was so dreadful .
they &apos;re always going to always be the same world and more frequently and more frequently from the same one . and i think that we should let ourselves <unk> .
i started showing you how powerful we bay ecosystem bay from the pollution and the <unk> and all the problems .
<unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> .
at the same time , he had to say , &quot; you know the book of michael <unk> ? &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> ?
we really had scared .
craig is moving the head .
you saw the skeleton .
we also have this ability .
it &apos;s got a modern way of something that &apos;s about the benefits , but i think we should recognize what &apos;s price .
clay shirky , this great <unk> of all , the assumption that the assumption is , the assumption is being recognized here in such a wonderful way .
now , there are so many new foundations that <unk> <unk> and investment , people together together , together , for a larger context .
and i &apos;m hopeful , because not only philanthropy is organized philanthropy , and other big parts of social media and business are working hard to do the business as <unk> .
i &apos;m going to get this photograph close to me . it &apos;s my office . because i always felt a mystic connection to these two men , i &apos;ve felt both learned .
my own research cell phones , and <unk> shows 80 percent of all the calls in fact to four people . 80 percent .
whenever you have a moment , they &apos;re going to be a <unk> .
and with the modern bureaucracy , a very <unk> approach , where it &apos;s a clear separation between the private environment and the public environment .
we make ourselves that texting , texting , facebook , facebook <unk> intimacy , but <unk> <unk> research shows how the <unk> can promote <unk> , to love love and <unk> .
one of the things that we developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve evolved several vehicles -- is how we think the first autonomous world &apos;s first <unk> in the world .
for example , the <unk> brain is to create a lot of <unk> .
no challenge .
for the time , <unk> about $ 60,000 60,000 in the year for a person to go to jail .
their family lives for eight generations in a city called <unk> , west virginia .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives to create more <unk> materials than commodity materials for manufacturing .
and we all need to invest in it .
and he won won , sometimes you &apos;re not going to do it on a <unk> in los angeles -- a reason to love l.a. -- back in the 1940s .
i started my company to help communities in the whole country to do their existing potential to make the entire quality of life of their people .
and before you don &apos;t have children , you don &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these pigeons people are discovering some of some things in the adulthood , &quot; community . &quot;
it takes time .
true is just a good thing to get out of a <unk> against one person , and somebody with it &apos;s not a person . &quot;
it &apos;s not a way to <unk> people &apos;s not far .
but i found out that i was the children i &apos;ve been born , so i love that i &apos;m not going to live with me without you .
he wouldn &apos;t reach his legs .
i come from a privileged family . i was lucky enough .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there are her .
this is the beginning 2000 . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here today , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia and built from us to be built by the internet , just as they connected with the internet .
think about it -- because there &apos;s other people like bill gates , who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
but in latin america &apos;s pretty rare . let &apos;s see some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have a case to integrate any extra <unk> of them to keep prices at the prices .
for a <unk> , my apartment is about as alien as space .
and we can take care of the issues of <unk> .
from a cliff cliff , so i was told that , in <unk> , although i don &apos;t know anymore , what the party wanted to do is to go through the support of the support .
wealth is <unk> people who are not supposed to call a <unk> .
the theme of the topic is larger disagreements .
none of these most important theories was a full of success .
we fear the world .
and as a lot of that work , we found something , or i thought something that was really fascinated me , maybe you can remember that .
in fact , it &apos;s just happens here -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i see their faces very precisely .
that &apos;s not a simple thing of joy .
this lady here is actually a particularly <unk> face , and both sides of it are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s <unk> light on when you move it , so it gets a <unk> object , although it stands to the quiet object , just like the reflection of the <unk> .
i had to move this part , but just about one millimeter .
and what i showed you before , of course , was a very complex .
it &apos;s going to win or lose in this moment .
the emotional bond between this object and you can make them to form a <unk> <unk> , which is going to happen before you think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to make these choices .
it &apos;s also a thought that we &apos;ve forgotten .
i think it needed to go to the tradition of the sermon .
we don &apos;t think so .
and the end of the <unk> are all up and say , &quot; thank you , &quot; thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you . &quot;
the other thing is that art shouldn &apos;t explain that artists to not reveal that artists to not reveal their <unk> , because when they <unk> them , the magic , and we might probably find it .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society .
we may not agree with the obvious things that religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional kind of thing that you do .
absolutely . i meet how many of you , people who say , &quot; is not something that &apos;s bigger than we all do , another thing ? &quot;
because you &apos;re 90 percent agree , because you have a similar view of view , you have a similar view of so much , and you think about the other hand .
so he led me to see how chile -- the <unk> desert in chile -- in the <unk> desert in chile -- in underground mines , in north america , to antarctica and even the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest seas of the world . it &apos;s 800 miles long .
and they won &apos;t believe it , but it will be the <unk> big telescope .
this was the hut that was scott <unk> and his men , when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south pole .
now , remember these whole <unk> are <unk> people in extreme cold temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll get back to it .
what people do first are they &apos;re <unk> , and they can look inside of the book , and that &apos;s fun .
it was pretty many people there .
but how do we scan them all ?
we took the 10 cents a page , if we &apos;re working with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what is going to be exactly the naked .
a day , two or three <unk> of them .
and with $ 15 dollars an hour , and about 100 to 150 dollars an hour , we can put materials on materials to do a <unk> online and it &apos;s on the web .
the question is : is the world that we want to live in the lives ?
flowers are going to <unk> .
we all know that the earth has trouble .
after the form of spores , they <unk> them .
if you go through the landscape , <unk> it up into their shoes and try to respond to the <unk> .
across all the <unk> .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a rare rare <unk> .
i made something different . i did something else .
the box of life -- you get a dvd from the ted conference -- you &apos;re spending the earth and water , and they have both <unk> and <unk> fungi , like the <unk> mushrooms .
i have lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know : is life adaptable enough ?
i &apos;ve kind of had some sort of time myself .
and the doctor was <unk> to make sure whether it was really good .
and everyone else fell to me .
<unk> , early in the early days , is one of these places that are incredibly beautiful and incredibly <unk> , and i have no idea how people do it , there &apos;s a life , there &apos;s no idea how people do it .
this beautiful picture , this beautiful image .
this is actually a <unk> .
i had to think about how to <unk> and the way you pick up and do it , but you can ask the right person to the right person that &apos;s going to be in a <unk> .
you put the <unk> , you took blood off , you throw blood blood , it looked under the microscope , put the culture in the microscope , <unk> the culture .
but we need a <unk> , pit crews for patients .
and that &apos;s how sometimes the medicine feel .
we looked at the <unk> of the <unk> , we looked at the <unk> , and we found that they and education , and then they have something else : they have to make sense .
and it &apos;s just hard .
so they &apos;re really immensely many bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that beekeepers means that the dead people can do very well , and they can &apos;t keep the losses that they could keep doing well , and they could .
they take their hives and <unk> your family to twice the family twice a year .
honeybees are still in the minority .
so let &apos;s take a cave in new york with an iranian bats , now , it &apos;s still 1,000 . this is as a <unk> <unk> within three years , the population of half the <unk> of the gdp of half .
now , not all of us have been meadows , or we &apos;re going to be able to transform the way we can transform , and then you can , of course , a meadow in a <unk> <unk> .
and i whistled on the holy evening in my wife .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> and other , that -- i thought i &apos;d like to do this 2005 , and won again .
that &apos;s very promising .
why ?
the whale blue whale , the biggest creatures on our planet , that &apos;s wrong , is completely wrong .
while the night roll their leaves , and you &apos;re going to be the movement , and the way that day leaves the leaves -- there &apos;s much more motion .
he wrote some very interesting letters on a his friends , <unk> <unk> , at the time of the royal society , the largest scientific authority in the u.k. , so he was talking about a <unk> .
so far from human beings , only about the people or the animals inspire the robot .
she doesn &apos;t know that they &apos;re filmed .
and then when it was a shared experience , it was funny and something that you could laugh about .
i was inspired by it .
this is in 2005 .
they were <unk> two of my guys , who had hidden cameras in <unk> .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to spend a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
the idea is still in the early stages , but it &apos;s just like this .
this is ted .
and this is the <unk> i want to break .
now , kids who are not <unk> , are a very special case .
they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
the discovery discovered by natural selection , incredibly awesome .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done on this <unk> .
the ant is not alone .
you &apos;ve just heard this guy .
i really appreciate that .
well , i don &apos;t think that .
well , maybe we should take it , metaphorical .
it &apos;s the devil . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , every one of them is an individual chord .
men , if you don &apos;t understand anything like this talk , it &apos;s trying to communicate with <unk> , and you can change your relationships .
third of the problem with the <unk> is the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a wonderful way .
i &apos;m going to leave you with a <unk> , that &apos;s very good for you .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look , what &apos;s in the middle .
you &apos;re looking at this direction , so i close it .
we &apos;re a <unk> materials .
it &apos;s actually 7 billion <unk> all their own passion , and all their own passion are following a <unk> and the part of a <unk> coming together and the <unk> and in their own kitchens .
and yet you can hear black holes , even if they &apos;re invisible , the reason that they &apos;re invisible to the space-time of the space-time like a drum .
our sun is not going to end up as a black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow of a black <unk> , but black holes can hear , even if they &apos;re invisible .
we can predict how it might sound .
it &apos;s also an actual mission for space , which will hopefully be the next 10 years . it &apos;s called lisa .
it &apos;s closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we have <unk> <unk> .
the trees is a <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the movement .
we &apos;re critical towards the west , the way of the west , the way our identity is -- the image that &apos;s going to be , about our women , about our women , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country before that , completely <unk> , and i &apos;m not going to <unk> .
iran used to be a society of society and we had democracy , and that was that we had this democracy from the u.s. government and the british government .
i stand here to say that the iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice gives me my voice .
so , on this one , one size , a wholeness , is , focus , you focus .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .
they &apos;re learning through swimming . they &apos;re going to <unk> bicycle .
the fossil fossil of this animal is just found in the area in south america -- a beautiful clear field here -- and in this part of africa .
you can just see these videos . if you &apos;re bored , they just go on .
but i was thrilled , and i went to this .
the khan academy video videos are also there .
this is the <unk> and the way .
red means they &apos;re <unk> .
most of the efforts of the effort is to make human focus on the classroom , &quot; students versus teachers . &quot;
and the cooperation that they had to go with in the closet , how did they come ?
is it ready for the big toss ?
a few months ago i got a call out of a <unk> where i &apos;m working .
but it &apos;s a silence , like a <unk> .
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
once for instance , when his <unk> was to visit him , he said , &quot; and who are these <unk> men men ? &quot;
and then when they were , flying the boy , the boy of all walks up up , up to the top , 30 feet tall , and disappeared .
these properties of a dialogue is not in these <unk> .
there &apos;s a field in <unk> part of this the window , and in the teeth part , in the teeth and eyes are represented , and this part of the fusiform is activated when people have the most sophisticated hallucinations .
&quot; kermit means nothing . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting . and i have a lot of pictures of my <unk> .
edith widder : i &apos;ve made these pictures with a special camera , whose sensitivity is to the darkness of the darkness of the darkness .
this crab , for example , <unk> substances on the water , just like a squid or a <unk> generates a <unk> .
this is a plant here , like a plant , but an animal .
there &apos;s something a little that responds to it .
it should attack the hunter of the <unk> .
so an approach would be a picture .
if we &apos;re going to double the double helix into their two strands , you see that these things like teeth .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
one is a <unk> of a <unk> .
again , these are all <unk> , scientific <unk> .
hold your eyes open and your head in motion .
the ability to concepts concepts can combine with images and processes to it .
if the <unk> is very thin , is they can be engaged in care and hard work to the world &apos;s most <unk> experts .
i &apos;m here to commit to you to support us to support the way people and other creatures are <unk> .
not by the <unk> , but enabled enabled by collective action , but enabled enabled by collective action .
the other great narrative is the social <unk> of the social <unk> .
toyota , instead of his <unk> each other <unk> each other , they treated these like a network and they exercise to produce better , although they also train them to produce better for their competition .
thank you .
thank you .
so we &apos;re doing two different things .
in fact , everything in the <unk> and difficulties are running and <unk> -- cold , challenging conditions .
first of all , we have evolved a little experiment where we put people together and they asked them to build something .
and if you said yes , we have a new one , and as you <unk> this , we have the other thing that they built in just back again .
there was a very nice relationship between love for lego and the number of the liver .
and i think the ceo &apos;s not understood , how important meaning is .
but i should point out , as the way that people would cheat the condition that people would cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
think about children .
and i think that &apos;s in the industrial revolution , adam smith was the real <unk> as karl marx , but now we &apos;re in the knowledge of knowledge .
now , this is a modern conflict , quite normal , because kids are going to be very easy to war in war .
so the mother &apos;s mother was so bad that they were to make our story , and all boys and girls new <unk> names were given to the boys .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .
they didn &apos;t want to do it . it &apos;s just happened . they have lost control .
and 70 percent of the time is their lives .
i think that all of this has given me energy .
this is the european average average of <unk> .
on the right , the same energy consumption per person has the same energy consumption per person in about 300 light bulbs per person , but the population density is higher times higher , 1,000 people per square million .
if you really want to get much out of solar panels , you &apos;d have to take the traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> over the traditional <unk> , which is not just the roof , but also the landscape with solar cells .
and a third opportunity is nuclear .
i tried it . it works . some call it change .
as a boy , as a boy , since the earliest <unk> , i wanted to be a musician and thank god .
he &apos;s a boy in caracas that his <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> with passion with passion .
and that &apos;s encouraging them to new dreams , new targets and advancements for the various opportunities to put music .
this is a <unk> technology that helps you to perform the simple task , the right pill to try to perform the right time .
so what we call the simple , <unk> technologies , and this is the first of the first of five sentences that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is this year . she went into the <unk> .
is the first word , &quot; doctor , &quot; i mean .
many of those generation won &apos;t press the button , even if you have a <unk> , because they have no way they want to fall , &quot; even if you pay for a long 30 dollars a month .
the color is different spaces in the house .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and <unk> inventions of cybercriminals .
if you want your competitors , your rivals will go , will you become it .
how do you get a <unk> to do a company in a company ?
so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker , we call a bad hacker that we call a bad hacker .
there &apos;s another other interesting thing that the cybercriminals had uploaded to the cybercriminals .
well , you probably wonder what happened to these people .
in <unk> , i could identify the hotels that were recently identified in which they were recently , <unk> precision .
thank you .
the <unk> can recognize the juveniles , the juveniles can recognize the <unk> .
and you &apos;re in something that &apos;s probably the blood vessels that are going through the bones .
we all know that these bones are broken , and if you &apos;re in acid , it shouldn &apos;t be left .
the <unk> are the big ones , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> is also cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> university , with <unk> .
people always say , &quot; why do you do that ?
finally , i started to write my book to the global scale of this problem , this shows a <unk> of the individual nations , after the <unk> level of food , of food in every country on the world .
so imagine , these nine biscuits i was in the trash of the trash , the world &apos;s worldwide <unk> , okay ? at the beginning we have nine .
this farmer has taken 16,000 pounds in the growing of <unk> , by <unk> , by which he was not a leaf , because some of the grass that are not perfect , the <unk> <unk> are not perfect , they will be eaten by pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , i cut a piece off , put a piece off , put it in a vase and then another two weeks .
and if you use these things , you don &apos;t need them to make a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to run a couple of <unk> .
on the left , after <unk> .
we need to change the stuff .
here &apos;s of course einstein , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s the great <unk> sentence , and i &apos;m not sure if the james <unk> or richard harris is .
and you can see the icosahedron in the dodecahedron , and then they just combine them together .
what a cat bottle .
before the horse horse
&quot; 10 milligrams , 20 milligrams . &quot;
so , i said , if i take a circle , you see what &apos;s going on for some of the pattern , and , boom , the red system .
you need to be right ! it &apos;s about the measures of the <unk> .
then there was only two more <unk> on the internet .
i &apos;ll come to talk to that later .
i mean , everything in &quot; <unk> &quot; to sit , that would be like a call of her <unk> , but for the whole world .
it could definitely be made of people in the audience .
if we had a chance to have a <unk> opportunity to have been on <unk> innovations , we &apos;d have talked about the <unk> innovations of the military , which is massive <unk> , and we could have an era of stability in the world or in europe .
now , in this environment , where you don &apos;t know , whether the potential enemy is to be prepared to attack or attack the weapon of the attack , that environment is appropriate to the most appropriate , conflict .
it &apos;s a giant blue area .
so , if you ever have to go to the time to see how a dinosaur looked like a dinosaur , this looks like a dinosaur .
she can &apos;t always throw them out all the way ; it &apos;s got to <unk> the pants down .
he never seem to be a certain girl in a certain girl .
but what i did was a <unk> .
you don &apos;t have to worry that the readers are falling in <unk> because , if you imagine a <unk> shark , you know , you know , you know , you know about the front door .
you &apos;re going to have a kind of urgency of urgency , find as much as possible as possible as possible .
my <unk> was wonderfully <unk> : <unk> the wilderness and <unk> .
so that means i &apos;m going to math math and to magic to make something that i call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
audience : <unk> .

their own personal <unk> is unique and often nothing to think about what we think about .
it &apos;s characterized by a sense of <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a feeling of doing success .
so , how do you stop the media to interpret their work or the science , what they interpreted their work , like the <unk> , like , &quot; oh , the mri is -- that play the intelligence increases .
the difference between our <unk> and the <unk> is that our really <unk> are a <unk> .

i didn &apos;t ask you to throw it to the <unk> because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a result .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human <unk> .
now , the neurons , as well , can grow new branches , new branches and old ones are losing old .
and we can even talk about the <unk> .
if you &apos;re hoping that number you &apos;re going to get that there &apos;s a big potential for the <unk> in the brain .
so , potentially , this technique is that we &apos;re taking ourselves through and pull ourselves through and we &apos;re going to put our own brain .
he &apos;s working on music videos and ads with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;ve been an quick experiment here to show you that .
ks : no , not .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a friend of a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did this .
so , his farm is incredibly .
then he found that the wild plant , the <unk> .
and then they &apos;re flying in a circle .
i finally got to try to try and try to try and try .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no <unk> .
what &apos;s the hell that &apos;s called ?
at least , i think , i think we think it &apos;s .

and from the old to new fire , means to move two great stories about oil and electricity that are both the two fifth of the fossil use of the fossil air .
our fuel for mobility is to cut down three fifth cars .
you can make it yourself , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
and trucks and airplanes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
even more than better and <unk> and so forth that <unk> <unk> around a third of the third area .
in about 20 <unk> , private <unk> cheap <unk> , without financial losses on their roofs and lower their <unk> .
and what we &apos;re doing it is , it &apos;s going to be like the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we buy more of it , what we have , or new nuclear , or less , or less , or less , or less , or less .
so , in the results , and not motivations , to concentrate , is , <unk> , <unk> and conflict for the world &apos;s population of the population .
i later realized that what i had had had had been eating two <unk> of his family .

you go back , back back , back , back , so this .
they come all of families that are often a person at home , usually the mother or grandmother , and they come to the education and their structure .
we put them on to the right and left to the left , so they can tell you , and the consequences are when they &apos;re orders .
let &apos;s all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s a <unk> .
they said , &quot; this is enough for <unk> .
then you can support . this is the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my pet .
you can listen and you can .
let &apos;s take the <unk> <unk> .

clearly , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t have was perceived to be seen that it &apos;s a very , very uncomfortable , leaving his <unk> .

well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really very big .
but it wasn &apos;t without <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green pulley on the horizon , which is very nervous about the rising rise .
we can start to make better , more powerful decisions .
<unk> <unk> : why i &apos;m going to <unk> across the pacific
this is the world trade <unk> on the front page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do this ?
it doesn &apos;t take any <unk> . it doesn &apos;t take any extra time .

and the last thing is to comfort , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about that they &apos;re feeling good at places that they didn &apos;t feel well .
and that &apos;s hard , if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to be somebody who &apos;s <unk> , and one day i said , &quot; you can <unk> my homework <unk> , and i gave him the wrong answer that i was about .
we both got to the back in the back of the class , so we were not going to be <unk> , was going to be done with <unk> .
maybe you have your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never in it , because how can you say yourself , because how can you say to you ?
this is french science .
well , then you go .
if you look at these truck here , it &apos;s the largest truck of its kind of on the earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing material of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now the number three , in terms of a <unk> per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing to do .
by doing this , we remove a big part of our biggest <unk> and replacing them with most greenhouse gas , and replacing them with most greenhouse gas , <unk> of the future .
the <unk> of their work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead , and it &apos;s a ritual that &apos;s been tightly tightly tightly tightly coupled with the institution of the marriage .

and their individual ideas , and their work with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> -- the self-confidence -- is my opinion , is my opinion , the holy grail of neuroscience , and someday we &apos;ll hopefully understand what &apos;s happening .
this person is otherwise in <unk> and intelligent minds , but when he sees his mom , he &apos;s his delusion , and he says it &apos;s not his mother .

here &apos;s the model of the <unk> .
if you see in north america , the way that many things are independent in the u.s. independent of the u.s. are activated . they &apos;re <unk> .
each of its favorite points depends on this critical region , the <unk> that shows you about the 10,000 independent cells , each of which every <unk> , a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low -- to pump the <unk> signal .
they were a little in <unk> in <unk> , but then apart .
so i want to show you a couple of interviews with people who were to put on the opening up on the bridge , and describe what happened .
now you don &apos;t usually hold for a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to <unk> and go back .
on the fact , there &apos;s just a few tons of them , so you &apos;re pretty fast .
but the <unk> scientist in his field .
i didn &apos;t know what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told them , you should look for their name , your <unk> , or the mother &apos;s mother .
and also , maybe this <unk> or maybe a <unk> that is not worth economically , an ideological or pests or pests or a different property that is useful for the climate change , and the other thing .

pay attention to your body . this is not right .
maybe you &apos;re still a woman , a woman ? thank you .
you &apos;ve just got two concepts out of this u.s. -- two in the u.s. , and one at the russians .
insane ! i have to talk about innovation -- the things that evolve develop , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they will die through something else .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going to go through because i don &apos;t want the competition to my schedule .
i mean something really interesting to this happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little about the commercial development of the <unk> space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has an epiphany .

all around us , a medical revolution , instead of a revolution that will help us , some of the worst diseases of our society is to defeat cancer .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a mass of mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood supply is after the treatment of the treatment .
but the real question is , how well work that in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> , it prevents angiogenesis in a very effective way .
but more interestingly , from the study of the men , the <unk> , the <unk> , so the <unk> have evolved to have been the more tomato , which is the bottom of the cancer .
albert von <unk> once said that &quot; discovery is what you &apos;ve seen before , and think what nobody else has thought nobody was . &quot;
i &apos;m a <unk> in discover magazine .
it &apos;s got to be fun , unlike the ordinary problems , the honest ones that are not particularly good are puzzles are good .
that &apos;s the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do it physically physically , but on a computer , it &apos;s going to be a computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
in which they &apos;re probably going to fall out of this ?
so , there are games like &quot; brain , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; the <unk> , a <unk> .
looks like a black figure . where is this ?
i think that a girl is being too , so powerful that we all had to train , not to be like this .
i remember , as an example , my father who was very , very violent , i was <unk> .
we &apos;re used to be able to be girls of the <unk> , <unk> of their own life , we actually have to be objects that we made and they &apos;ve been transformed into them .
and she looked at the eyes of her baby , and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby .
when we were there , she was a ritual where you &apos;re girls who are <unk> , who are <unk> , with their families .
and i will be going to be on your side of your life on your side . &quot;
i love it that i don &apos;t make things .

so , in actual process , all the six teenagers would have made out of the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that they had done by the photo .
but this incident was taken in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , at 7 a.m.
this is 10 meters away .
and what &apos;s this example -- what &apos;s important to us in mind is to keep in mind ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and traveling a year by africa where i asked people to build the fractals , what &apos;s a great job if you can get it .
and that &apos;s in some villages , at the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i &apos;d just use long , because it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s very cheap .
and odd is a strange .
we have a <unk> <unk> .
the bad news is .
instead of getting friends , or relatives , they were used to make a job .
today , <unk> development is applied to a hundred countries in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to the <unk> .
the fear of losing <unk> is losing .
we put some rules on and we keep on them .
the conversation will be better . &quot;
i &apos;m just going to take a evening of <unk> here , to come here , i started one of my daughters .
and we developed 10 of them .
i was a teenager , when i was to say &quot; anna <unk> , &quot; and the famous first sentence , i read , &quot; everybody happy families identical .

one thing that i want to make is to be clear is that not all the <unk> are wearing <unk> .
we can <unk> them or turn them on or .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it into the circuits of the mood in cases of depression .
we &apos;re using that circuits and the brain in the brain areas for the clinical trials and symptoms are symptoms of those diseases and symptoms of those diseases are responsible .
evolution works in reality , as an <unk> tool .
that &apos;s enough .
what we &apos;ve discovered is , if you look at the top of a human being , like richard , or the one of the <unk> or a crab , the relative <unk> of this feather is the same for all that we &apos;ve seen to have seen until now .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s amazing , students have tried to do it , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he does that with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hairs as a model , and imagine , and imagine with another colleague of mine from berkeley .
so , by the <unk> of the <unk> , two thirds of the men &apos;s men , two thirds of the men &apos;s men have only children &apos;s third women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and went to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; what &apos;s how it went to you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study harvard business school school , a woman called heidi <unk> .
and i put my hand back again , and i noticed that in all of the other women , and then you have to have more questions , just by men . &quot;
and a woman who got me on this and i looked at her -- she looked a little bit of .
thank you .
they don &apos;t like to do it as well as they should , but they do it .
so , not fear was the <unk> factor .
but it &apos;s true in the middle of the middle black .
i want to talk about how we &apos;re talking about how we get in this country to the information , like we &apos;re going to get information .
so you &apos;re in <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of language that &apos;s done . and this works .
we tell them all that everything is okay . it &apos;s good to you .
this patient is about 50 , we can quite say , how big are the risk of being in prostate cancer , to get prostate cancer .
you don &apos;t need to take the <unk> of the audience in this room .

the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : quite <unk> , a <unk> , even i could get a <unk> of 10 <unk> in 15 minutes .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass of this altitude , on these <unk> , and it &apos;s going to happen immediately something interesting .
and now i &apos;m saying that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but it &apos;s not true because it &apos;s already in the development . it &apos;s happening .
if not , the real thing . there &apos;s nothing to do .
come back to a certain time , get your drinks for half .
and then they can really achieve different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a <unk> dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked about the last time i talked to you about a couple of years ago .
you also see if i turn around this around here -- i &apos;m not going to <unk> the world .
you can see , here &apos;s it .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> <unk> : who actually <unk> students should have been teaching , the law of the <unk> , just as a kind of a kind of <unk> .
raise your hands .
it makes it fun to work fun .
and so that &apos;s why we work , and we actually have people who are excited about this and crazy enough that they work on , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel was like he said to him for his passengers was the experience of the experience , through the countryside .
what makes life easier to be more easier ?
so , part of the <unk> you do this , by creating a great new facility , the basement one of their hospitals used to use the basement one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems have been <unk> <unk> and we are in the fact part of the present problem .
and as brunel can brunel , we can have to <unk> the systems , have a greater impact .
by my responsibility , the waiter <unk> the waiter with his boss .
mark <unk> and i have tried to answer a series of studies that i &apos;m trying to answer this question .
but it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm does .
but for the <unk> , the <unk> availability of all these <unk> on the market like a <unk> .
the americans themselves discover that they &apos;re <unk> in the theory of the theory of the theory of the theory of all the time .

&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one together : they &apos;re <unk> problems that are controlled by the forces of nature .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s needed by collaboration by collaboration .
and then we &apos;re building a <unk> that we can test the air on machines on machines , and so we can actually be very , very quick .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the best best thing is not as a <unk> is to be understood as a <unk> movement , but as a <unk> movement .
the <unk> enter the stage .
and then the <unk> nuclear power that would provide the energy to the rest of the los angeles .
then you take it and put it on the screen , and you &apos;re looking at the outside of your phone , right .
if you replace the word of the word , or you replace the internet , it &apos;s very right , that &apos;s what i hear is very <unk> . let &apos;s hear it in .
i think it was the exchange that has led to computer .
ph : i hope you understand how <unk> that &apos;s .
ultimately , the race would be about the future , as the phone company , <unk> .
mm : because there &apos;s a role in the audience to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has been <unk> , which is a very exciting new way of communication , and we &apos;ve got the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is an spanish architect and designer .
color can <unk> simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it &apos;s given me to give me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about and build a few installations .
the operation that the city for the public space has been carrying is significant , almost an international model .
even the bits of the aircraft had names .
he said , &quot; well , first there is more girls there . &quot;
and that was finally , like i , after some of <unk> and <unk> , the design of the chair , i was showing you the same .
he said , she &apos;s got a new , good chairs .
or they &apos;re pulling them up high in the position .
i know , and i was in the offices and i <unk> myself in the office where there were <unk> with <unk> , that would never be the idea of the idea , <unk> , to turn to the headrest in position .
and dengue has spread in the <unk> .
two days or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember any more exactly , i &apos;ve read that <unk> <unk> <unk> , about 52 million cases , about 52 million cases , with about 400 cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so that he &apos;s not going to spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males &apos;s getting females , every amount of offspring .
so , <unk> aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i take away , i was barely <unk> of a <unk> .
look at the data that &apos;s available data .
well , our mobile phones can come from now a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : their health depends on where they live .
this is my grandfather .
so , from the very simple reason , nobody else is talking about it .
like the dawn , they &apos;re pulling phosphorus phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a <unk> of &quot; nature &quot; to the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of them are mentioned as they lost .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one percent of the <unk> .
we have a functioning technology and a which is at <unk> , using some of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re in the world &apos;s opening world .
and he was a <unk> <unk> : he thought he could all <unk> and mutations and mutations to look at the norms , rather than the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual <unk> are repeat , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> without being <unk> .
as an architect , i think about relationships between the computer and the whole , but in terms of design , it &apos;s always a matter of business for businesses .
we put ourselves on the level of the building , the building of the building where we could build these five separate towers , but they should all make all the time at the 60 floor to a single <unk> crowd .
so , again , a few years later , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually actually used to look at <unk> .
the difference is particularly in <unk> in the desert in <unk> , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste waste , a lot of things that are illegal and now at the air .
we have the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by the fertilizer , just by the fertilizer , which is huge problems in the water quality , in rivers , lakes and seas , and it &apos;s also the most important thing to do for the <unk> .
but we can do that , and there &apos;s some opportunities .
north is the biggest <unk> on the <unk> .
to work together .
so , what &apos;s that is that we have to model system ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
all the system that &apos;s worth of investment .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biology to amplify these <unk> -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve off , from the little parts of the <unk> parts of the <unk> and the other whales that gave us the <unk> -- signal . two other , which gives us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t have an electrode there and say , &quot; there &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something a <unk> <unk> to wear .
this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
life has been saved these conditions , there 22 million people living with hiv , that are <unk> 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments in the place to do more effective in clinical trials , for ethical things in clinical trials that are authorized in the world in the different world , <unk> in the government and the <unk> of the study .
the fundamental problems that we face with is a high consumption of consumption and too many people .
so they meet all the criteria that people usually usually like .
so you see this electricity that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> in this case -- the way to the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> that &apos;s going on the galapagos .
we also know that not only <unk> are not being threatened by the same magellanic , but as other <unk> .
i want to show you that penguins will be pulled into <unk> .
turbo &apos;s got <unk> , his <unk> on the door to pat the door to pat , we put it in here .
and then there &apos;s another thing that &apos;s very pleasant is coming in .
well , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved , our basic political geography .
the two parts of a fairly long frontier .
again , like the case of mongolia , china has gone to russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
for <unk> countries , china <unk> its <unk> , so that <unk> and <unk> can be sold and <unk> to china .
so what i want to you here is , i call a <unk> , day after day .
these two <unk> form a bow , a <unk> of <unk> and other infrastructure that the west bank with gaza <unk> connect with gaza .
most of them .
so what &apos;s next is what comes the future of the european union union ?
53 countries and the most of the players straight lines on the map .
this dream is <unk> .
it &apos;s all bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone receptor is growing growth .
so how can the hormone end up the speed of aging ?
we think that the insulin and igf-1 hormones are active , which are particularly active under the <unk> conditions -- in good times -- if food is there , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on the lifespan of people .
and in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of me , which is a very quick process of what i &apos;m talking about , another <unk> , like a bird , so that the bird could be a much longer life .
you &apos;ll never see an ad like this , because nike wants to do their shoes .
they all have heroes , the <unk> were used .
it &apos;s like trying to run into a <unk> .
and this view is what &apos;s been coined , that many of the <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s prozac is actually changing the chemistry of the brain , as if the brain was a bag of a chemical soup .
and my co-author , seymour seymour believes that too .
and through the <unk> of the <unk> , we found that a mutant , much longer needed to the <unk> of the <unk> , and when we <unk> the genes that were a role in that mutation in that mutation could discover a <unk> .
this question has been asked for a long time , but in the way , we can test it in actually .
so , mosquitoes like that , in the dark , by <unk> , they &apos;re smell . they &apos;re smell .
so just to you , that &apos;s the cheese .
people actually have said they &apos;re bitten now they &apos;re bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time i feel the <unk> looks like the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes .
and like <unk> , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
as we speak , i &apos;ve been able to study clinical trials studies to study the use of stem cells for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have these angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our world .
so what happens when what happens when it doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything else because i left the news .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about before you know
but what ?
it &apos;s actually better . it seems to be that we can make these receivers , using the help of the material that is encoded in the dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s got it &apos;s going to be made his wings , it &apos;s <unk> that , but it can &apos;t really pick up , because the fly between two <unk> trapped .
for a smart expression , like our fly , it &apos;s not going to be in stone , but it changes , while the animal is learning through experience .
so through a lot of experiments we were able to be able to take the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , as you could do that , but we have not just solved one example of how smart behavior is living with the physical interactions of the physical interactions of living .
so here &apos;s actually libby , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : all right . tb : okay . <unk> : okay . a little more in the middle .
from their own experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my <unk> from legacy .
one of the one i &apos;m saying , this kind of <unk> , which is all of the <unk> , from their goals to their genes , will change the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see in health care .
they stick it like a <unk> or glue .
so here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen when you get the bottom of the <unk> and it &apos;s got a <unk> or we would shake the leaf ? &quot;
and so <unk> , well , and he does this .
of course , completely different than you see it in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say the people who are working on the oceans and talk about the goals , we need much lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice goes down melting sea level is about six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the corals are islands .
their relation to the water .
but then at the end , you see the <unk> black in black .
we have very interesting technology that &apos;s carbon dioxide in the atmosphere millions of years , we &apos;ve always done this with <unk> , but in this case , we go 20 million years .
and this is the challenge that he asked , how gravity works : how gravity works .
einstein had already been room and time , warps time , warps and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of the room , the idea of that room could give more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a <unk> , you can vibrate the same threads in different patterns , they can vibrate .
not .
is this just an interesting mathematical process that maybe is able to explain some of some of the <unk> properties of the world , or we can actually prove these extra dimensions in the world , or we can actually prove these extra dimensions ?
so we &apos;ve got two plates with colored points .
now , can you see the <unk> , see the <unk> , which is what &apos;s going to attack ?
and what &apos;s sensory information is true for all of the information that &apos;s going to happen in general .
and we look at 30 seconds of what a lot is a hammer , in a 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because if the redwood tree in this shadow , the same amount of light on your eye would turn the same amount of light on their eye , to you , you know , the laws of physics would have to reflect more .
where do you know ?
and she gets to get into the beehive , finds a void <unk> and <unk> -- and that &apos;s honey .
he &apos;s got it . it &apos;s madness .
do you agree ? yes ?
often there &apos;s no right there or wrong .
in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers storytellers .
now some things : understanding , the risks , the risks , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the very many risks with whom we are facing .
think of cancer , avian flu , swine flu .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> , by the way we &apos;re going to take data on our <unk> and data <unk> the data for the <unk> .
i was familiar with a group of people , and i could determine whether my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people that are .
and he was found out there was a close to stanford .
they had good suggestions with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took anyone to do anything , you know , to get them to get them or save me as a volunteer , but i found out that nobody did something .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups were very often immediately immediately called terrorists .
you need a <unk> process , which is very complicated to the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that , we probably probably know in the history of the arab world a revolution on the ground , is a <unk> .
paradox is that the <unk> decade was so promising . and it &apos;s from an reason that &apos;s one reason .
once we call the <unk> , the <unk> of their slogans , but they took them in the negotiations , because they took them into the negotiations , because they were the victims of the weapons of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy thing to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , this strange , rich man in the film ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day comes out the sun , the <unk> coming out , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to admit i &apos;m a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of radical stuff , how we &apos;re going to think about cancer , to a audience that &apos;s a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of the ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics , by just the genetic repertoire .
and i like to say , &quot; okay . at least , this guy is good . &quot;
so we measure each more than a very own one more than a own .
if you have malaria , we give them a <unk> , or some <unk> of their own .
where we really need to get to the process , the process that &apos;s just like , and that &apos;s the level of the <unk> activities on the level of the body , the body is not useless , how it does it normally ?
danny hillis : cancer , of course , is happening .
they all are members of tribes .
it doesn &apos;t just do it , these people just give up .
because at stage three , most of us are most of us .
that &apos;s their <unk> .
there was no plan . never before anybody did .
in fact , martin luther king was <unk> sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i &apos;m doing nothing . &quot;
and then she took the <unk> out of the time , and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of africa ? &quot;
automatically <unk> : we <unk> the little bits of little plastic .
these <unk> or <unk> <unk> that were designed to go to the floor for the soil to <unk> the <unk> for the floor that they face , they were not as permanent as a permanent building .
they <unk> the stability and the security that &apos;s the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , comparing them with the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in high high school .
but by my perspective , compassion is a problem .
and it &apos;s the <unk> shape of <unk> gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and he can &apos;t really explain .
stories like these , sign like these , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s desire to bring compassion to the <unk> of suffering that would otherwise otherwise us .
gandhi was a really <unk> man .
and the first day we had our <unk> us , and we taught us our slogan , we would have to give up the rest of the <unk> , and we had to give the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of them famous .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group , without understanding , instinctively , the other .
so that &apos;s the world where we live today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather to learn my grandfather .
okay , number two : they go in the wild .
and imagine that , you &apos;re looking at a very inner image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in , unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re now incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we have now 30 different technologists in 18 different technologists and we were able to connect millions of people in the order to connect millions of people to keep learning what this needs of the needs and demands .
and my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation that make it better than the previous previous one has to do it better than the previous previous .
i know a lot of people who are very smart and yet , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started to 1980 , with another family .
don &apos;t believe that we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still go to the same four years old as before .
but this is not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether you think you believe it doesn &apos;t matter for me .
so he said , &quot; what &apos;s you do in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and that basketball represents her identity , what they are .
when my kids were still tiny , i went to her room , sat down in front of her bed and watched my children in sleeping .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , each containing a different collection of 100 books , so that the <unk> had 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
you answer the question : how does it feel to discover that you &apos;re going to be <unk> ?
we &apos;re actually really learning that really bad lesson .
think for a moment , how it &apos;s been to feel .
and other animals than all other animals are obsessed with it , trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i write this incredibly <unk> book about a subject that all hate , for an audience , for an audience , never .
the effect of this is not just <unk> wheat wheat , but mountains of grains .
1986 came from vietnam to america .
the answer was <unk> : &quot; that &apos;s worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank on a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom dotcom , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and bhutan &apos;s bhutan , for the most recent democracy , the most recent democracy in the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually so that we &apos;re often getting a lot of the west for happiness , when we &apos;re lucky enough to do that , it would have to be a thing , or maybe several things we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really learn as a society is that we can impact the <unk> of production , by creating the right conditions , so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : all bl . one , two , three .
under deck , you know , the <unk> , you move the <unk> , but the eyes are moving in the room with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , come , come up with the top ?
the method : what did you see ? what &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing ?
i &apos;m just going to read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and they enable to make them , and they &apos;re willing to express this , so amy the last word in this short story .
poor people have this choice of choice .
we were <unk> in the 70s &apos; 70s .
and to go there , we have to recognize that the principle of a <unk> isn &apos;t just the way we &apos;ve talked about , but also our society is <unk> .
now 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody who has already said , &quot; yeah , great things up there -- but how do i get there up ?
i was a professor at <unk> davis system and got a lot of attention to it , and that allowed me to finance the start of the program of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people wonder if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , you know , the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> of his wife &apos;s mobile .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : it &apos;s like , &quot; it seems like this , actually , as if it was actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , which is not going to be <unk> , they &apos;re a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> of the <unk> of poisons .
first , a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , called &quot; <unk> death . &quot;
but i was only months later who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it on life when you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we have the hope to keep the hope again .
but a feature .
suddenly he knows that he defeated .
so to give you this , we need to put them back on the driver of the driver .
we <unk> the area , we put it , we sent people into the building , we sent the buildings from the inside , we took the buildings from the <unk> , and the <unk> .
if i do that , i don &apos;t get the original details . the contrary , i could write here history .
you &apos;re withheld from the public opinion .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and what &apos;s about one democracy is .
here &apos;s the question : the country &apos;s average is better , china or india ?
because the indian man has an advantage of life expectancy by two years to the indian woman .
what political transformation is in , they have <unk> .
china , so i think has some of the great , <unk> of the foundations -- especially in terms of social capital , public health care , a sense of equality that are not there in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> backgrounds and with various <unk> and <unk> .
and now they have the problem that they spent all the money to do that , to do with this , <unk> electronics in these countries , and now is all the <unk> .
a little chaotic environment , where many ideas were created many ideas where people are more likely to interesting new , interesting , <unk> -- people different heritage .
so , about a two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> called howard <unk> , and i was reading a <unk> notebook from this period .
she <unk> himself in their colleagues , but everyone said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was .
does it go to the other direction ?
in the 1970s , the &quot; one percent &quot; 10 percent of the national income are in the united states in the united states .
many of these political factors can be in , in the category of &quot; capitalism , &quot; and crony capitalism , the one group of good interconnected , and <unk> <unk> , but not nothing for the rest of us .
so as you can see , as globalization and technology revolution is that global policy revolution is much more difficult to grade the money .
so they invest in unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern <unk> .
this is his little hand .
at one of these , we &apos;re all going to die .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we had believed in a new development .
i think that in places like oregon , where you can take care of <unk> , and a toxic dose can <unk> , only half a percent person has ever done .
so long , a long talk short , they came to canada .
but i heard the cancer as a most of the most controversial disease of our time , so how did the good and the bad thing together ?
some of the article went to say that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond it , not only to cancer , but it was about cancer , but it &apos;s about that metastases in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s what these <unk> tumors in skeletal muscle were , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what <unk> is that skeletal muscle may be able to control angiogenesis , which is capable of being able to control the tumors that these blood vessels are <unk> for themselves .
it &apos;s a very far <unk> idea , but i think that &apos;s possible .
after left me my translator .
she was the girl that &apos;s in the breaks for the other for her team .
and the same thing i wrote a letter about my best friends in atlanta , georgia , which was 11 years old .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all over korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , and see , the <unk> of the side of the hotels , the <unk> , the hotel burns . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bath , and they were holding up and they were holding them before our faces and the children .
until the adoption of it . one year ! it &apos;s going to have so long ?
that &apos;s their <unk> .
this is a <unk> sydney , which is three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there &apos;s a little planet , there &apos;s a lot larger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do more .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon , or is it something that &apos;s dependent on the planet ?
and this is deeper <unk> , and the point is that the science is that the science is , life , how we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , all right , right , from here .
thank you very much .
you see , in uganda , and zimbabwe <unk> , russia , russia , russia .
you find the most highest hiv in african countries in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , down here , the same rate as the united states .
look at kenya here .
it could be something else , which is the transmission of transmission .
we know that about <unk> billion people ever lived .
that was not just an economic story .
and the result is even more divergence in a shorter time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same thing with institutions .
they have to eat me . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions of the future , just before , in 2016 , if the united states will lose its place as a economy to china .
no , we &apos;ll probably be <unk> , despite the giant <unk> of giant <unk> that we &apos;ve lost , despite the evidence that we lost our work and other parts of our historical <unk> .
niall , thank you .
there are many types of spider spider spider .
spider spider is almost entirely of protein .
the fibers that make a single spider , are quite diverse .
and also , <unk> has a potential potential for its ability to <unk> .
what i &apos;m paying attention is not the <unk> , so she &apos;s going to be so gorgeous , but the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
this is sound alien to our ears , but what &apos;s going to happen to happen is 80 percent of the <unk> have contributed to a lot of .
the first thing happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal is to the institution of the institution , is immediately by the end of the desire to the self .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there &apos;s people in the states who are trying to find out whether they &apos;re journalists or not .
she was created by by using their <unk> , who use a lot of these tools , including the <unk> intelligence agencies the world today for the last week for the attacks of the last week .
you have <unk> , which is probably what &apos;s the most <unk> part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just a little bit of fibers , because there is a fibers .
everything is in his place . first .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the <unk> of the potential of the potential of the potential of the potential to a deeper level -- and my search is about the answer &quot; what &apos;s so special about bread ? &quot;
that &apos;s transformation , two different things .
and when they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove that they &apos;re alive and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of spent every kind of time .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of <unk> while we work through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these things , and i &apos;m working on a piece that is <unk> for <unk> pages , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m <unk> to my life .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> by brian <unk> , who &apos;s an extraordinary artist .
so you have a little clip of the piece of the piece .
so what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the birth to two dishes with lunch : a bowl of <unk> broccoli , and a bowl of <unk> .
i mean , at the end of the time , if we look at babies at the time , they appear quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer than the babies depend on each other species .
the <unk> is going to make them change the hypothesis .
now , there are two things that really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is extremely bright and vivid and vivid , and everything is just like dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and the <unk> of the human species , &quot; the research <unk> shows the <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s research as babies as babies play while making the <unk> molecule and make decisions .
if i could take you for a little demonstration for a small demonstration , to borrow the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
then you repeatedly repeatedly this process and over again , until something -- in this case , the figure that figure out how i walk straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do it .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes , like it &apos;s got .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some of the studio we already use to do is that we &apos;ll just see some of our <unk> in some big <unk> in some big <unk> .
we thought that it just would just hold balance .
here &apos;s how you learn to go to the <unk> -- how most of you know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are quite essential to design empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , you write a new york times column , then they get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;ve done today , is reported by frustration .
some stories are just about , but it &apos;s so understandable .
it &apos;s <unk> . nobody has bought it .
there &apos;s a frontier that we don &apos;t want to go through . so what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you have a new , empty document document in word -- that could be the case .
but i think there are actually two <unk> .
the other products were made by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard standard .
and <unk> , if someone writes a <unk> writes -- what happens to a day -- i say , &quot; i &apos;m leaving . &quot;
but when i looked at the <unk> technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the face of <unk> species , i made a lot of worry about the <unk> .
and to cut the risk of this new thing , we need to have the capacity of the individuals that are going to have access to the access to the access to the access to the <unk> .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to develop this <unk> with the background that we &apos;re developing from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have a variety of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of a little bit of the two of the little effort , it &apos;s worth <unk> for a 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s quite remarkable .
and if you &apos;re using the concept of these two dimensions , you can see a lot of <unk> &apos;s energy -- the effects of the market -- that &apos;s how to make feedback .
12 years ago , i started to love to be , and i shifted my research towards this direction .
so , wonderful and so <unk> things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form .
it &apos;s actually so much energy in this cave in this cave , that there are actually a big number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that there have lots of traits that are from people and other organisms used to be used as a habitat habitat .
whenever you get a goal , it &apos;s to its <unk> , and you need to get a little bit of it .
and this is the way in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> were made of the <unk> and it was suffering under a tremendous <unk> .
that means before we could start to digitize the <unk> <unk> to digitize the book .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the electrons around the speed of light , they emit a little bit .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> of the <unk> had a son called alexander the big , and they lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , <unk> institutions are their data with more and more .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most <unk> <unk> of the 1700s .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for this thing ?
she has four balconies .
a <unk> scheme is that many of these things made from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i couldn &apos;t get into the fingers , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of the taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not necessarily the same thing i didn &apos;t have been impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there , with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold for <unk> real dollars .
so this really interesting about what is , in fact , is that you can measure them .
well , i could design a game called <unk> , by having a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok , then . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and so , is it gorgeous .
and i want to tell you a quick story , so in 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how powerful engagement is transformed by the psychological and the psychological insights that we get when we see people in the game .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> that is officially called <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there &apos;s hunger in america , 49 million people and nearly <unk> million children and nearly <unk> .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30 anniversary anniversary of <unk> <unk> and the big <unk> , of chicken <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the way we &apos;re about agriculture international .
this is a <unk> that i &apos;ve got two years ago , and that was in one of the great projects that i &apos;ve been involved and my company .
but i &apos;m going to close to the beginning of the process , three very <unk> .
if we are so good , what we should do is we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an active manifestation that is absolutely <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
the architectural implementation was , <unk> , said , simple .
and this is the actual <unk> .
the second technology we used to do , we use things that you know from the <unk> of one opera .
here you see the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how you draw stories , in some way , <unk> .
one of these projects is about a year and a half a year .
these are the images that automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera to go down .
you can see a timeline that you see the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , on .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if you thought about a year , what would you do the next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money deserve and open a business open , &quot; was the indian <unk> .
and as she was , he had told them that he wanted to be , and he had a <unk> chance of a <unk> .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , i &apos;ve got a lot of benefits .
it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then the communication of <unk> .
very funny people , if lol lol is that means .
you don &apos;t do it .
if someone was seen in 1973 on a black board of 1993 , the <unk> had a little different <unk> since the time of &quot; love , &quot; but he had understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wished to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work next week at the whitney , at the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> .
afghanistan is not an existential threat to the global security .
and the same thing is true for the forces .
instead there was a <unk> of optimism bias .
diplomats are diplomats in <unk> .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we were in bosnia and kosovo , the secret to our success , the secret part of our success was in our humility -- in the <unk> fashion of our <unk> .
rory , they mentioned libya .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you a very fundamental , what it looks like .
there &apos;s also <unk> <unk> that will be <unk> , but if you &apos;re these <unk> <unk> , these are going to be used for a different type of <unk> .
the <unk> . that &apos;s a difficult problem for reasons that i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another very , very interesting connection , very interesting connection , and this is what you want to do is valuable information to lead a precious information to lead a bad <unk> .
so i think it has the minimal food that we probably can do to make things .
and we decided that we can &apos;t be so much in terms of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book called &quot; what &apos;s the world &apos;s office ? &quot;
so we need to ask ourselves why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t even don &apos;t interact too much with people who are not like the themselves as you .
so we can think about things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only half , if i say you &apos;re in the hospital , if you arrive at the <unk> , you arrive at a <unk> , with the previous <unk> , mri and <unk> <unk> .
then he turned home to his students .
within a few years , in the late 19th century , early 1900s suddenly became the doctor of the doctor , who was trying to put a diagnosis on the <unk> .
between the perception of the patient and the physicians in terms of the best best services and the physicians in terms of the best best way .
another experience i did in texas , before i did , at stanford , i was doing it .
the bad news : the very important thing we don &apos;t know . see ? can you do that . &quot;
i remember so many giant , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who was in this ritual to me .
some call us <unk> , a rather <unk> term .
in this case , we have the case .
for you , back here , &quot; then , &quot; then , &quot; then , then a miracle !
and there were no way to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
difficult is to move the dead one to an answer .
my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> , wrote the book &quot; the big bang &quot; and so on .
and now you open your eyes .
you can open it up , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it turns out to the thinking of what these guys , most , most , you know , what they do for doing a living .
all the thought that we &apos;re impossible to do .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need any one .
hugo <unk> has not invented the <unk> <unk> and the middle class of venezuela , and it &apos;s not invented it .
and it &apos;s all that time .
they connect people together .
the reason that &apos;s a modern medicine is used to a 60 years old .
there &apos;s a catch .
it makes it <unk> faster than 100,000 times , and over 100,000 times , and over 400 times <unk> than our <unk> <unk> for pancreatic cancer .
my experience with the world is very different .
there &apos;s a character for b.
and why does sex get into babies , and why do babies mean all the time an erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret to the <unk> .
so particularly , particularly , the description of the other other or my own -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in desire to be there .
this is her <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , which is natural instinct .
so there &apos;s a desire to desire . this is a study curiosity , <unk> .
you know , there &apos;s an <unk> space that everyone alone owns .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
it &apos;s going to be more frequently in smaller rooms .
so early <unk> some <unk> are <unk> .
so i said , ok , is this a model for design , these <unk> that we do ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned himself to me and said , &quot; the there is me !
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to make here to the language ?
albert einstein -- i was just a talk about somebody when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein , and i met mr. einstein .
what is it about life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he was talking about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rare , so powerful minds with so powerful minds of authority christ . &quot;
or he was what he was called .
i &apos;m not going to talk about the <unk> nor <unk> <unk> .
but it &apos;s going to have to sit about 10 minutes and a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i never had .
harvest <unk> .
i was tears in the eyes i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman is president <unk> , and she says , how she and her siblings , her siblings , her parents died in war .
we go in rural areas , and everything we do , how it &apos;s happened in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look at 20 years of now , and see that there &apos;s another <unk> girl , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> girls at the ted stage .
lg : pardon .
licklider knows , computers can do the necessary <unk> to make insights and make decisions .
each interaction is about increasing sensors : your phone card , your credit card , your card card . it &apos;s a lot of data , and we get the opportunity to understand it .
these records were human <unk> .
by being a <unk> process , which is introduced to 40 people over three months , and it became a simple assignment for three people in 40 hours . all of these are the fine <unk> of the <unk> .
we should stop looking outside .
dinner with my wife and the children home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i didn &apos;t fit time . you want to be mentally .
she was a much more powerful dog than i thought .
this impacts all affect us .
the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
think of <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina , we have more of the same .
and you probably have done this , and if not , they will have to be it .
help me make green to new black and help you help me to make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to my mom &apos;s a chance to make an interactive map for my mom .
but i &apos;m a <unk> , which is that <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , put it on a stack and the stack of <unk> determine the behavior of different characters in a game or a story , in this case , the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to learn .
when kids like this projects like this projects , learn important concepts like this , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a back of a background , is the thought that there are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think that this thought is that great cars is a soul , is very decent . you know , a car with the soul , you know , how powerful it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> that really is our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it was cheaper to be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven homes , elizabeth <unk> to rent .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt like each other , we felt very close to each other , we were using the concept of the real nature of true and we <unk> the concept of the real nature of true <unk> and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring it to boston .
so , i just got a little lab .
now , we have clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that we can do this drugs on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to remember is that we have a hundred billion galaxies with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to the answer , we have a good theory that can explain if this is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so it &apos;s going to be , although the universe will forever be <unk> and <unk> ordinary matter , always a certain amount of radiation , some of the thermal fluctuations , in itself , in empty space .
but we also give big fluctuations .
it cools off .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe that you accept and not question .
i never used a computer yet .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t tolerate .
now i want to see something out there , like me , to say , to the africans and the poor who who are struggling with their dreams .
no matter what movement i was in my real world was just using my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took that very literally , i took my <unk> , and he put him a little bit of <unk> on the table that shows good <unk> .
the camera is actually understood not just my movements , but also , to understand what things i think is in my hand .
and why is just <unk> ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is carlos <unk> , king of spain .
this is the third park in june rio june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down under the earth to build the <unk> .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example .
almost every year we have these terrible <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re on average , in terms of the average of the city in the city of the city .
a city of the future is a city that &apos;s not , of these great community , which cities are .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwinian <unk> of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that they &apos;re kind of <unk> , so it makes you joy , you just see .
and some of them are too big to use them for the battles of the battles .
so our strong response to images , to the expression of feelings of art , to the beauty of music before the night sky will be at us and our offspring , as long as the human race .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see the computer looking at the environment , and there you can &apos;t see the <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> the driver &apos;s actually with red leds , so it really can see what &apos;s going on .
let me see if you can avoid the mark .
or for blind people , in <unk> , in <unk> , in education and in the office and in the office .
a more subtle <unk> had begun to do . the <unk> that normal people don &apos;t hear , and i heard them , meant that something could not vote with me .
my mental <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , <unk> , and physical and sexuality , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , and i was saying , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , is easier to cure . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> : if the social change starts , it can &apos;t be more <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now through .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than on mars , although mars is also a much more sophisticated and more interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were filled with contempt .
because it &apos;s <unk> that the way of life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to a planet on a planet .
there was another object , this <unk> of furniture with the creatures and <unk> and naked -- quite <unk> -- quite <unk> .
so the first projects were modest , but they took technology and turned it into the technology and turned it into things that people could use in a new way , and perhaps a new function .
the other thing that &apos;s the <unk> is about <unk> , is that we decided to <unk> all the gadgets , this whole <unk> , and trying to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we ended up with y water . so this is another example of where everything together in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas that brand , it &apos;s all tightly tightly interconnected .
this is my <unk> anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to take it back . it was hard .

they need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation that are growing up in a world where everything is <unk> and some of our best talks on a screen .
and the thing that &apos;s the end of that she could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if you wonder why it &apos;s interesting to be interesting , then you need to look at the rest of the saudi arabia because it is a country &apos;s very <unk> between the <unk> .
maybe some of the things are bad traditions and they need to change changes .
let me give you an example : in turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had something that i call <unk> , which should protect universities .
if i would be the only person that &apos;s like , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims , as muslims , they were independent , they were independent , <unk> .
so the e.u. process , the efforts of turkey , the efforts of turkey , the eu , within the turkey of the men , are supported by the men , while some of the <unk> nations were on .
there &apos;s a very big nose that didn &apos;t seem to be the <unk> , as if they &apos;re connected to something connected .
if scientists today , a century ago , neurons can make neurons , and then they &apos;re going to put them off from inside , rather than you .

in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation of the simulation , and others that have learned it in the reality .
if i say , &quot; i mean the advice for the <unk> .
but nobody believes that it actually is very effective when there is an actual outbreak .
the biggest part of the race is in the veteran of the veteran &apos;s administration , actually , in conjunction with anthrax , and the threat is through <unk> .

manhattan is not more to infinite infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i stay in the middle .
she became one , i was to the triumph of it .
because the leaves leaves and branches is very dark in the very <unk> and very quiet and very quiet .
i &apos;m talking and my colleagues of the <unk> are <unk> for the dynamics of the <unk> that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising ourselves with the media &apos;s media ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .

he said , &quot; you know what they &apos;re hidden in front of you . &quot;
so we can see a rising demand for the <unk> , and therefore , therefore we can see a rising demand .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you need to believe in it . trust me . &quot;
and i was actually making two things that day , two really important things .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
so the air is going into the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the air .
so everyone of the computer can do the whole system , so if two of them are , there are still reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this is a habitat forever , over a lot of miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people .
when we found it , we were not even sure what the family was heard , so we called him <unk> , so we called him <unk> &#91; after &#93; he came out of one of his books .
oxygen toxicity is a <unk> and he <unk> .
this means that every one and every one of you at least there is a child knows that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and his communication and social interaction is so <unk> that he could visit a normal school and even a <unk> .
he &apos;s like something that &apos;s like , if you &apos;re in it , you can &apos;t get back out .
i know you never heard of him , but you &apos;ll notice this day , one day you &apos;ll be , you &apos;ll hear it , because it &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he &apos;s 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love over every lot of love he loved .
we all , are that what happens when they &apos;re making a hydrogen <unk> out of hydrogen and helium &apos;s so long , you can get your origins to questions about their origins .
these <unk> prove that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to estimate the diversity , and the incredible scale of life on the planet in this planet , to learn a deal with a <unk> in life , to get involved in all of the <unk> .
so , in order to silicon , silicon like aluminum , and we will continue to expand it down to 350 antennas to 350 , so it &apos;s sensitive to moore &apos;s law &apos;s law .
and then we &apos;d like to make the <unk> search for the human <unk> .
so many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to explore the climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> time .
while they <unk> the ice , put a extra pair of gloves in an oven for so that you can get a new pair of gloves in an oven , so you can get a new pair of bags , and your fingers are stiff .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> .
and our soldiers are looking at themselves at the pipelines to <unk> pipelines to <unk> , if they were actually sent to service , to the american <unk> .
you can still push that further , and efficiency efficiency in some <unk> improvements and the cost of the <unk> of the major <unk> .
we could build bigger cars that would pay attention to safety , but easy to them .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan because we don &apos;t have to protect for protecting our <unk> and the other .
and that &apos;s where the <unk> step is to <unk> the way to the <unk> of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to make <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> , the <unk> can do the same as the internet has been .
it can &apos;t just act a giant <unk> conspiracy conspiracy to act .
there were two types of negative feedback that we &apos;ve received .
hope we hope it is really stable .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
at the end , he was a <unk> , a dutch <unk> named the han van meegeren who was wearing a wonderful vermeer sold to a prize , who sold about 10 million dollars a prize today .
according to his <unk> , he saw it from the first time he discovered for the first time he discovered that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all about . &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find , how much you find them or romantic , depends on what you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects have a value beyond what it is , which is a <unk> because of his history .
but i don &apos;t want to copy , even if i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to his <unk> in a <unk> in washington d.c. , to ask yourself to the <unk> and see how much money he will take .
the second shock hurts less , because you &apos;re a little bit of it .
and if you <unk> , you can see that there is a kind of a <unk> of a political <unk> .
she <unk> that you have a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , that people who eat vegetables and olive oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most remarkable things in the world medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> end , if you give a drug in a very high dose , that there &apos;s more side effects , and you &apos;re going to look better , and you &apos;re going to look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
that &apos;s a problem for that , for that , there &apos;s no way that we &apos;re not going to have a solution .
and very soon , they would have started this charcoal <unk> , 2,000 times around 2,000 , <unk> around <unk> , <unk> around , back to china and all around the world .
can you imagine how they feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , that all of the things that you know .
there &apos;s this thing , the <unk> of the world , and it &apos;s from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? you &apos;re christians .
man , americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
so they &apos;re <unk> . this is wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everyone else are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them who got to his child down morning and it &apos;s got a nice and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m going to go back after .
everything has changed .
and all this has tremendous implications for the world .
i think thomas jefferson really did really well in words .
in the audience in the audience , so even why <unk> has a higher budget than <unk> , that &apos;s because <unk> are easier to other languages in other languages and cultures , and so , in the market for these films .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the u.s. <unk> of the u.s. , which is about one million , but the gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as anyone here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a lifelong obligation that has been on the <unk> of the gulf of the gulf of the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet that affects our living environment , is just by believing and guess .
one has been for thousands of or millions of years .
we need to calm ourselves before we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : saving life on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the genome of the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion pairs of pairs .
the reversal of the de-extinction is falling in these category .
so the real falcon is a little <unk> chicken .
and this is a program for the <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional theme . some people are up .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
i made my own comics to tell my own comics , which was another way to tell stories , through words and through pictures .
and we sat in short , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
using your own style . draw not like you &apos;re saying .
&quot; i prefer your <unk> , i have your <unk> .
i &apos;m going to publish a children &apos;s book called &quot; <unk> police <unk> : the <unk> who <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us constantly physiological , psychologically , cognitively , cognitively , cognitively , cognitively , cognitively , <unk> .
this is a <unk> million pounds , so important <unk> , which was built in britain recently , by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by it .
people who say they don &apos;t leave the team next to this team because the noise like that , and the other calm needs .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a <unk> business , who his life in the suitcase with them , and the <unk> and reality is not in the position that we and reality is both too <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and a half years and then was the work as a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> talented actors .
i know that theater connects us to connect us .
now the time we can use the diversity of our talent to make a smart , important and extraordinary work . and <unk> .
if you look around in the bathroom , you &apos;ll see some products more like <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- it &apos;s used to fold in to fold it into fold .
i &apos;ve found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid , you &apos;ve got a long and <unk> year . &quot;
i said , you should be <unk> , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
you have to feel the feeling of being somebody , in a time that i didn &apos;t feel like this one .
they work on the 29th , so she &apos;s got in the <unk> , and now the letters is the letters .
hundreds of verbs can behave .
you can see that as the language of thought , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is why , in polite requests , are polite requests , <unk> and <unk> so often ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could be used only literally .
and the other thing is that i don &apos;t have a problem with this .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it makes it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what you won &apos;t do is convince me to convince myself ?
all these different rollers . you can imagine an argument that you &apos;re in , but in the audience , and you &apos;re watching the debate ?
or -- and this is the most exciting part of me : we want to be that you <unk> us in the world of nature . we put a <unk> and find the masters of the <unk> in nature that we could inspire .
it changed everything . it changed from there , these engineers were not going to <unk> .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national laboratory laboratory .
this would be <unk> for solar cells , if you could do without <unk> .
it &apos;s not just because it &apos;s just a subset of the elements of the elements in the <unk> .
and feel that feedback is very important .
you can &apos;t count , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
in south korea , indonesia are almost half of companies companies .
because , as the <unk> notices , smaller <unk> <unk> are related to the <unk> economy .
and the thing in all the world are no exceptions .
people are <unk> whether this <unk> and this miracle .
i have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , even <unk> cows on my <unk> and want paper paper and then i want paper paper to <unk> it .
we first have it .
what does that mean ?
when i started to work with them , i noticed that they were incredibly good adapted to have this incredibly good .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they ended up their degree and campus at all the campus -- and sure were happy to come down there -- some time later , and realized that the crows still came to them .
we &apos;ve found that they &apos;re really smart and they &apos;re teaching each other things .
squirrel for instance would come back to the peanut and again .
but there were three problems , three mysteries that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know , there &apos;s the <unk> of the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of sound .
each about 10 million <unk> .
and over here , we see , in the words of the radiologists , israel , &quot; the hand of the penis in a way , &quot; the hand in a way . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yeah , but i &apos;d rather just eat to the end of the dinner if you don &apos;t have anything . &quot;
i said to , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book that was supposed to be <unk> , there was a <unk> maria <unk> , which was the trouble with the conception of conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i &apos;ve got to read them what she said , because i think it &apos;s pretty nice .
i think that i find very unfortunate . not because i &apos;d like to use it . i wanted to see it .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now , i would have thought to that moment that &apos;s the age of 50 , one of the skills that i really had , was , i was to bind my shoes .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yeah . the artists seem to be so really right to know where to <unk> the various colors .
but i can see in their faces that they &apos;re still a little bit like a little bit .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s a <unk> .
so after a while , i decided to have a fun of having a little fun , and before i left the room , i fell some things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all here in there .
my father was a little , so my youth was therefore interesting .
that song is just as mere .
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; wait , yeah , yeah , i put the wheels . &quot; made me steal me . &quot;
it sounds simple , but i think that we &apos;re in general in our society and culture with the <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> himself , and he was really quite proud of it .
boy , i love this thing .
the consequences of a planet , which is about seven billion people living .
so , very , very proud of him , he was on the cushy seat , who was really a little bit of a <unk> seat that he had had his <unk> , and the beautiful <unk> around the seat .
intent -- life with intent -- is aware of the original little better <unk> .
i looked at the healthy mass of a left and i realized that she was lost , <unk> all of the after i didn &apos;t have done , but not anymore .
and then i started thinking , as many times , how my life would have been to be helpful if this man had no injured me , if my genes would have another one of the experience .
i was , but i was , but i was a <unk> , i guess , i guess , i made myself .
i had a lot easier to invent : this turkish <unk> of the <unk> of four words and i &apos;d come back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yeah , contrast .
we work with the machine at <unk> university at the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural interface of control , so that the interaction with the robot is intuitive .
and yet i made this idea .
after i &apos;ve been recognized this , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some people have even credentials the speakers in the field , like to speak , or the one of tim ferriss that occasionally seem to be a very hard time .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes the dangerous thing .
so this time i was paying 25 cents , because i thought the job was a little harder .
and yet , there was one thing that all of you were sure : the expansion needed to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the back , because i &apos;m now going to call them three <unk> string of string theory .
the <unk> went on about 10 to 500 .
and he worked in the decades that i had to explain that number , but it didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes have extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by looking powerful telescopes to the sky , are a handful of <unk> photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , billions years on the road .
well , i &apos;m going to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you &apos;re hit it . we want to really work and work in the way , and even more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri &apos;s so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know here .
the next moment , the phone rang , no more , the tv is coming out , <unk> men on the street .
it was a very prominent meeting of reporters who had been working on the war , the staff of aid agencies , and of course , of course , brave and brave people of sarajevo .
if i asked to ask why i &apos;m going to do a <unk> , why i &apos;m going to stay here .
but my job of this testimony is the testimony of the <unk> , and that &apos;s the <unk> , the core of the thing , for us .
even before the objective is to be able to see that they could try to find with the joystick <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the target where it is .
we basically <unk> animals , so they learned to control these <unk> and objects in the virtual world .
in a experiment that we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was done the <unk> .
please raise your hand .
the last reason , it has to do with that women &apos;s part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , in a cut dies , one of seven women died at birth of a child .
it &apos;s got part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> when he <unk> as a <unk> of the world bank , once , &quot; it can be good , that investment in education can be the highest <unk> . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the <unk> of a bird .
this whole <unk> around our <unk> tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this image is going to be clear to the suspect of being <unk> -- like something from the <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
one of these things was that we could have gotten in small <unk> .
they put their arrowheads up and say , &quot; i want to work this advertisement against the finished arrows . we &apos;re going to share 50 to 50 .
there are places on this island where they all three or four miles in a new language .
when 27 individuals of these 27 member of these 27 member of these 27 centers , their 23 languages , they &apos;ll tell you a army of <unk> <unk> , to all of the <unk> possibilities for all of the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they did .
and what most of the most interested in , the invisible space between a text and the other is the same image , and how the image is changing through the text , and the text through the image is changing , and the text through the image .
these are <unk> <unk> that &apos;s going on the bottom of the north atlantic ocean and north america with europe .
it &apos;s a negative to turn this negative .
but by the idea of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> served eight years of a 10 and <unk> <unk> sentence , in arizona , for kidnapping and <unk> a <unk> boy on a <unk> boy .
they &apos;re people to go to themselves .
and they &apos;ve got them to texas .
and now , you drive the food with where you &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the length of space that it &apos;s going to look like , as a result .
so something called a <unk> , the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in part , the most pessimistic <unk> , the <unk> , who &apos;s the pursuit of happiness for <unk> <unk> , it will stop by <unk> aspects of the individual , and can &apos;t be found in the reality .
a <unk> of science is that happiness and <unk> is happiness and <unk> <unk> in a closed-loop continuum .
it starts in <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a three year-old old old baby .
in the animal kingdom there is only one way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you vote rats ?
once the rat understood that , let &apos;s make it harder to a little bit .
you can actually heal it , even in humans , the hiv &apos;s hiv-positive .
knowing that a patient , which is microscopic <unk> , until 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be sure that we &apos;ve saved a lot of life .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is , if i just watch another person &apos;s being touched , why am i not confused , and you literally have this <unk> of the naked watch , the naked watch is being touched ?
thank you . i &apos;m here today today .
i &apos;m not going to go around the <unk> , but to the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> by the way in the lab at the lab .
even every single one of us has a single story of the <unk> on us .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer to do this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we and death , as we and death , heart disease , they were always going to go on , wrote an op-ed for the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women , whose <unk> is the view of the heart . every time we can rearrange something , it &apos;s a little bit of radiation , and ask , &quot; is this test ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they did what they said they were <unk> and they &apos;re campaigning .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish , they &apos;re not to be a local .
what does that mean for us ?
over three years ago , we took a daily eight to 10 hours to take a <unk> of <unk> and raised a <unk> of hours .
this is one of the first iteration that i did a little bit more than a year ago , which is a year ago .
and so , to conclude , my son is in a <unk> <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project , philip <unk> and <unk> roy and <unk> are here .
and there is a fascinating dynamic in play .
this is the first time that our son took more than two steps on once , in the movie .
and this is an important to <unk> question , because the better we understand how the brain is actually generated better , better , we can think better , better , we can think of it together and work .
it &apos;s a sort of a center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh , i have a strong or emotional response to the stuff . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is our teams of putting the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but also to the possibility of being clear .
so it doesn &apos;t make it .
if you translate that into the construction industry , if you have a <unk> , a window is broken , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that must be .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;ve continued to put it .
are we just stupid ?
you can maybe <unk> it in two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so she &apos;s going to <unk> them in september , and i &apos;m important .
why do you not do that , and why do you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the time to cut the vehicle into the pieces to do the <unk> of the body .
and that &apos;s enough to the present in the present , in the united states , on the united states , the eye of the divine <unk> finds .
all this leads us to -- <unk> , just to name the time : what we &apos;re doing most of the most things is to use digital devices .
that &apos;s the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right through the stroke of the brain on the right .
this is a very , very low level of being released from the health care system .
he then then hold my jaw in the right position as he <unk> my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and an innovator , who &apos;s fascinated in the other way , in the consciousness , if you will close the ear , you can tell you whether it &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> .
now i had to have to go in the dark years that followed me , what i stayed when you all know about that , disappeared .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing world : they had large families and a relatively quick life .
and these are on this side , a large organism of africa and the same thing .
and then deng xiaoping came to deng xiaoping and raised money to china and then bring the country back into a middle .
so a search for that we can copy the data into a <unk> format and the world in the world , and what we &apos;re going to do is , if we look around us ?
but this is made hypotheses .
you know , darwin &apos;s been explained to life after it came out , but what was the essence of life ?
and there &apos;s been taught where i was studying crick .
but there were the literature in literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girls didn &apos;t marry me .
you can compare that to compare dna to the other dna , and compare it to the other <unk> .
and so i close off by saying , by saying , we &apos;re going to see that we have 20 people with schizophrenia .
average average cost in one case , the defense in one of these two million dollars and take 18 months when you win .
first , they don &apos;t fight the patent for the patent , but against the <unk> .
my solution : give me the patent , and i &apos;ll let them leave you with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; &quot; i ask the girls .
the fathers were in a place where they move their daughters to play their daughters , their <unk> and their hand for the dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not a much left remained the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
you can &apos;t see most of the time , and so , and that &apos;s how we needed another approach to polio polio than we had done it .
it has helped , <unk> <unk> , sars for example .
the reality of polio is now something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio for a halt .
dj : we found this <unk> , now in all sorts of animals , especially with the big bang .
and we became the surprise it was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many ways a symbol of inspiration has become a symbol of inspiration that &apos;s our work .
it was incredibly amazing when she took it into safety , to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> , the <unk> was , it reminds me of a human way to a human , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman and wife , as a community and we need to keep on it .
it seems to be obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun &apos;s and mobile , but it &apos;s worth remembering what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on to do this .
and that &apos;s because in middle eastern , the <unk> is always there .
nature &apos;s got this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them there , and because there &apos;s no consensus on their <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , as we see it in middle world , <unk> and <unk> .
people as they treat machines like , scientifically , scientifically , scientifically , but it &apos;s a <unk> of time you want to think what the question is going to be next .
i was at the night of the <unk> <unk> at the <unk> age of 40 years .
so , over a <unk> , i allow me to take these <unk> , video of the robot to see video and send them to see video and send them into a <unk> .
with the help of people , we can make this dream .
in the philippines , for example , a <unk> of the <unk> is developing by the <unk> of the <unk> , by the <unk> that the dolphins are sending out .
i think together , together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there are some lessons there , there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but usually we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of the globalization .
now , this is about 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also also pick that most of you don &apos;t know chinese -- what &apos;s really sad , when you think that this is the most common language of the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this image , you think , &quot; why should i care that ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would make wealth and security , religious violence and sure that states never had to terrorists , <unk> terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war , 20 million people took life -- until today , the world &apos;s civil war war .
<unk> sen , who is this guy , &quot; i would have all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all this time , the american man who had my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done in the same way i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso &apos;s chicken , which is actually in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was at the university in new york city in the early 1970s , and so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , the <unk> search is search for medicine , the same thing .
so people would have a really big job .
when the <unk> started to become less , i became always <unk> , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember to come up with a child to any line ?
at 18 , 19 <unk> i fell through .
and again , i &apos;m going to get something depressed and something <unk> .
so many of us , it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s in the next few years , a lot of the world &apos;s building a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where the world worked in the treatment of the familiar problems with the familiar problems that were made of the potential of the earthquake and climate change ?
if you make the impossible , you make it possible .
but we have reached one agreement to climate change .
and there was crying .
the <unk> does something remarkable : they &apos;re using two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their <unk> to create a material that &apos;s exceptional as a <unk> , comparable to technical fibers .
or you &apos;re <unk> beautiful things like this , if the camera can catch it .
here you see how it &apos;s taken off the tissue .
with my new project , i want to use a <unk> for art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s the <unk> and the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him some some of the other decisions .
what should i do ? &quot;
at the end of this , there &apos;s a little bit of the demonstration , heather knight data , a <unk> that can be more than <unk> <unk> -- he &apos;s taking the feedback of his audience and how to work the answers of his audience and how this thing is ?
stanley <unk> , inventor , inventor <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> that there were between two people a connection about five to seven steps .
how does our view of relations with all sorts of <unk> ?
but there was a <unk> <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where it might be that i could have this ring in the ear .
uh , my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided that she needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility about life , despite his young age of 17 , and he also had his fault to his guilt , he was because he was out of a camp , while his friends were left , he kept his whole life .
and while my <unk> and my <unk> were given to the <unk> , so i was raised my father false papers .
i asked him , in the face of the victim , he had to be , if he ever had the <unk> .
we &apos;re growing by a few millions of people on the seven billion people we &apos;re today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> on <unk> level , which is a <unk> for the next <unk> that seemingly <unk> is in a good state .
if you go the forests , the border on the <unk> <unk> <unk> you &apos;re going to stay in the ability of the <unk> , stable to stay stable .
with the knowledge of <unk> , fishers , the great great barrier reef , <unk> and scientists , that the great barrier reef is <unk> , is <unk> by the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , is that transformative change is not an option .
and that leads me to another reason , why i &apos;m here today , because i really like to really love the media .
this is a <unk> of a race from a race of a long developed .
first of all , he uses an ancient way of making the <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which is a whole new technology that was a whole new technology .
and by doing the process of sugar , i made portraits of black <unk> , i made portraits of them .
and it was very big images , and i took them with a very big camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , particularly , <unk> , is enough .
and the back is a sequence that is the chimpanzee .
so we can ask : there are more general differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of today today .
we can then ask ourselves to the same questions , like for neanderthals : have been the ancestors with people &apos;s today are mixed with people ?
there are a lot of people who designed their own vision for , like this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
so , after my belief , the airplane of the future is to be his own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re embedded in a <unk> way , and the forces that the forces that are in their components are in their components .
they don &apos;t talk . but particularly , very , very isolated from the world around them , from their environment and by the people .
they would be <unk> . they would be called the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research that you &apos;ve been engaged with , really , you really have a impact on reality that you can actually prevent these experiences that i started my way to this area .
then you pick up .
<unk> <unk> you can get you in a linear body body -- chin to the <unk> , arms <unk> over your <unk> .
they made all the same way that we &apos;ve taught them .
and after the battle , you bring this in these mobile and what you do , &quot; <unk> , &quot; to you , to give you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
well , people have changed .
i asked , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
it &apos;s not a <unk> .
and she showed the left work to me , like the problem of this image that was the way it was to be able to see the idea of how black represented the way that black represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the <unk> that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m doing .
now , there &apos;s a kind of obvious statement up there .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re going to be numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long you did you before you decided that you didn &apos;t know anything ? &quot;
their <unk> increases in 50 , what else will make a <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> biotechnology with a <unk> biotechnology .
it was 76 percent . the test for two months later , the result is 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be <unk> da vinci .
these are <unk> .
suddenly , i looked at the darkness of the darkness side of the location , the location of a <unk> of mirrors that were <unk> by the moon .
if i had to reduce the entire story on a picture , what would it be ?
now i &apos;m going to show you some of the clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re <unk> .
i know that you can understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . they &apos;re both playing in africa .
it &apos;s another one that &apos;s on the intersection of health and business .
let &apos;s take the markets as the <unk> <unk> , which we have , and figure out what the price would pay people to pay for them , so they would have the choice of the election .
thank you .
the <unk> was : if my mom couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we raised two <unk> and 10 tv .
so the little <unk> of them , they remove it from the trace , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s getting slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models that i work with .
tissue from <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key part , these models of <unk> .
thank you .
trying to fly them up to the <unk> end of the <unk> end up looking forward to shoot at the <unk> , and boy , boy , boy , i have a lot of respect to nature .
so let &apos;s take the other side of the other side .
we work on projects -- even recyclable developments , as <unk> as <unk> -- with darpa , institute of technology and university in the university of technology .
be careful , just like wood , just like wood or so ...
now i was not trying to be <unk> .
they go forever forever .
these are about two billion .
it &apos;s going to require it after the estimate of about three years of <unk> .
don &apos;t forget that one of them .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in , in the human mind and machines can win machines .
i clearly have mass . where do you come from ?
it &apos;s too fear that the way that the <unk> are <unk> in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence of <unk> that is that cancer is being carried by a virus .
i took the opportunity and collect some samples from jonas &apos; tumor , and some of the specimens from other parts of the body .
they brought him to the veterinarian and this discovery .
ultimately , cancer is a <unk> consequence of the ability of our cells to share with the ability of our cells and their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for waiting for waiting .
and that &apos;s the third reason , why is not a low expectation .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers are <unk> .
i first will show you the <unk> of the optimism bias of the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion isn &apos;t going to break if we &apos;re aware of this <unk> .
but what we see in the 21st century is asia , which is incremental , which is gradually , to harbor more than half the world &apos;s population and over half the world .
you could look at this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after the soviets , sputnik had <unk> , it was , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re fresh japan or new delhi , or <unk> your view of china will be something different than if you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we will be able to put this in a larger historical context .
how do we define our national interests , so it &apos;s not just a <unk> of positive .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this has increased the responsibility of the responsibility to <unk> a stable <unk> .
they &apos;re on the long time .
jobs for whom ? especially for young men .
after the time , the law has collapsed , you can &apos;t even get the land on the land .
the service would be from their own , after conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my new orleans .
the military has been understood . they call the climate change a <unk> , and security and stability while governments are in the world , how to respond to the world .
it allows them to be more productive so that they can afford to insurance so that they can afford to insurance .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions when we feel able to plan to plan for a <unk> world .
listen to the chinese students &apos; practice , by the way they &apos;re in english .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and this includes things like the <unk> world with <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and we try to make sense , and we take the hypothetical seriously , we ask questions of what could be , as what is .
luria , when they were <unk> into the scientific age , before they <unk> into scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a certain amount of concrete world .
there was always the north pole , &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose to <unk> new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you be killed , you know ? &quot;
you could say , a <unk> .
it feels like i got in a colony of angels . &quot;
and she <unk> me to make a degree in anything .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifices , this film <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> of her .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all mad at them , &quot; why do you do that ?
it &apos;s going to be a lot of real if you read it . &quot;
we had always been playing the game after the school for weeks , about seven weeks ago , and we had all 50 <unk> in the world , essentially .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people were working for good jobs and <unk> jobs , and <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like your own little connection .
if i put all three legs in it , put in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very poetic case -- this old <unk> and this old plastic , and this <unk> is very easy to an old <unk> .
that &apos;s possible , if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can school in a high school or a state school -- a leaf , a ruler and a pen , a ruler and a pen , no , no .
what we do is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little straw that you &apos;re doing , is these two corners here , it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
it was very much the ship , and they were getting bored , so they were <unk> , so they were asking the <unk> .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> <unk> <unk> simple and yet stunning plans to turn waste in really <unk> , well as they can build basic principles that kids can build themselves as they learn to design basic principles and the design of science and learning .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that was the many evidence that we were in charge of biology .
and there are some examples of projects that are going to be able to imitate ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can get a place of traffic control into a turn that open space for people to create and waste into opportunities for people , and waste into opportunities .
this is taken on the day of the day magazine , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you <unk> seawater , the first is the calcium carbonate .
no , you have to recognize the people living , <unk> <unk> of visions . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish , and i &apos;m a very important .
but the real <unk> was that there were lots of men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be completely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel until it &apos;s not a <unk> .
i was trying to be like <unk> .
because they remember my <unk> : you have to get a <unk> of 700 points and nobody did this .
most of them . <unk> are in average 33 years old in average average , not eight years , and when we look at the most <unk> demographics of the <unk> , the <unk> of the morning older adults .
imagine that vision is very , very good .
so these <unk> have even many other benefits in terms of attention , and a sense of attention , which is also clear , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember that outcome , and it &apos;s in the context of a different group of <unk> , a group that actually is looking at our society , which is made of people who are doing high high school .
let me give you this step with a challenge , which is a mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of calculation .
let &apos;s just let all of you in particular , the particular programs of that particular case .
so it was a big , very complex project , which i was not sure if it was going to work .
wolfram alpha knows about many , and lots of things .
on the side of the page , we have mathematica , with its kind of precise , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> developed capacity to do a lot of a lot of a bunch of lines .
so , with physical <unk> , we are basically used to go to the world and see that certain materials make sense of certain kinds of things and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about the discovery that there are candidates universes with incredibly simple rules , and also the general relativity and gravitation and at least evidence of quantum relativity , gravity and gravity and at least evidence .
sw : i think .
and while that time , i lost more of these things , as teachers , and teachers , the <unk> , hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
there &apos;s a woman that was a woman , she didn &apos;t quite <unk> on property , and automatically , all my family owned , he was sitting in my father , so he was quite .
and the day before the actual ceremony was dancing , we were excited , and didn &apos;t slept all night .
he was wearing white and that in a village that had not even <unk> the streets . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl girl , and i would come back and do anything that they would ask for me to ask for me .
if it was pregnant before , the mother was responsible for doing it and punished it .
as we speak , 125 , 125 girls will never be <unk> .
consumers , the 72 percent of the american gdp , actually , like <unk> and companies <unk> , right as a <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> , themselves , if we move forward .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of fact that we &apos;re actually <unk> and essentially the principle of the fact that we &apos;re in the principle of our homes , the future children of our own households .
<unk> are about 48 percent by the jack institute .
we also observe a trend too , too , too , <unk> tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and the more vulnerable , the neighbors are the neighbors .
we also observe a big <unk> .
the trend is immense .
then we &apos;re taking the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then the question came , i &apos;m the only one that does this thing ?
you could exploit them .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing in my life -- stories stories , novels , and today i want to share with you a couple of stories about the art of storytelling and also about some of the <unk> creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could be able to shrink . our heart could be <unk> , and our <unk> could be <unk> , if we were too long within our cultural <unk> .
and there was the first time i met , as i call &quot; raw <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , not a <unk> or <unk> . i &apos;m going to ask you why i do this . but i took a school proposal between languages to invent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i was <unk> .
literature has to us on the other side .
i could <unk> a novel about a muslim woman and maybe a happy woman , and in my next book , i write a happy about a <unk> professor , professor , <unk> professor in norway .
so you get , you &apos;re taking the existing songs , cut them into little bits , and shapes them in little bits , and they &apos;re going to pick up a new song , but this new song is clearly <unk> from ancient songs .
instead , these laws and laws are more abstract in the world , rather compared the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;ll wrap up what it &apos;s like , <unk> , <unk> : the <unk> of the telephone , by the way you get a symbol of his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see it because then you &apos;re your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; she &apos;s made of the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see these limb , sort of <unk> <unk> , which is from the limb .
our exploration of the solar system is taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single nucleus , with <unk> , the orbit of the circle .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it &apos;s also , you know , the most important ideas for us , is to <unk> , over our place in the universe , and really the value of our home .
this is . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with each other , and every touch touch the screen , we let any touch of the screen and <unk> <unk> of our personal information over the digital forest .
when our daughter turned on the <unk> , i asked them , &quot; will be much worth of your school to musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t even <unk> this .
now , i want to take you to this journey .
and because i was so much , i decided to talk about my 27 birthday i decided i &apos;m not going to talk more about it , just a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ...
and i explained to a friend that &apos;s my sign of the sign of the mind that i was john francis that i was on life , i was not going to be talking , and that would be the last time someone would translate my sign .
well , i <unk> my backpack again .
i started to talk to the because i was <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was on each birthday thought about my silence , but i never worried about my decision , just my feet .
born and grew in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in the exchange for food .
i was constantly worried that i would be able to return and back back .
i felt like that , because i had so much food in america &apos;s so much food , but my father was passed .
but i think that your gesture of love and the <unk> can save the life of another joseph , and thousands of other can change that still have the hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but that was much more powerful than i expected to make it and make it easy to make an industrial <unk> and also <unk> <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we work for society , but for the <unk> , rich , the government , the government , the contractor , the contractor .
and then we started to california , there was a big earthquake in the <unk> in the japan .
so i ask myself , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born in the womb .
so what fetuses are learning is even the very specific language that &apos;s talked to the world where they &apos;re born in .
it &apos;s a combination of the influences that are so individually , and curious , like the woman itself .
why should malnutrition in the womb for malnutrition ?
you can also see <unk> , but also with other eyes .
this is the trust in the <unk> , for any kind of <unk> &apos;s essential .
the audience will become <unk> <unk> , which are all the obvious , but not with what happens to your eyes . &quot;
and if it is a good story , it &apos;s actually , maybe it &apos;s actually , you know , smile .
you might remember the <unk> <unk> , ok , at the time , as the greatest deal of all the time , <unk> .
if you &apos;re a high animal at unesco , and somebody who says you , &quot; what does it do you actually do for the <unk> of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is a role in the role .
for me , all the music became .
so if i use my software using my software , the camera is the <unk> , and the point of <unk> is in relation to the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a whiteboard .
i remember the poor poor things needed to -- eat food , clothing , shelter -- which they didn &apos;t have .
i actually felt a <unk> of shame <unk> .
now , i heard it , i was excited for a couple of reasons .
i didn &apos;t even asked them a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the poor story of the poor , and it &apos;s about something of us to get a chance to get into a traditional , what would not have a partnership in a traditional way of a donation , can happen <unk> .
it &apos;s a very powerful combination , a very powerful combination .
now , the right now is <unk> , and it &apos;s very complicated to me , and it &apos;s very complicated for me to just a vehicle , just a tool , just a tool .
what &apos;s the future of humanity ?
now , i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone , or there &apos;s other life in the universe ?
the answer to these big questions show that we &apos;ve done considerable progress in the last hundred years .
see this one .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate is doubling in even every 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> knows that &apos;s the <unk> law .
but what &apos;s going to do it with you ? what &apos;s going to do it ?
they put them in their <unk> across the sky and occasionally they attract people for the experiments that their parents would not agree with .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
and older generations could not make these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was a <unk> <unk> million years ago in the form of <unk> .
<unk> can we learn very much of them .
and i see <unk> and i &apos;m trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t even leave anyone , even one minister of the time , even one minister .
and secondly , they say they had a <unk> gang , but some <unk> for the <unk> of trees .
so far , our knowledge came across the human ancestors in the human principle , because the fossils , the fossils , were missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> research is exploring the origin of humankind in the vast ethiopia . he talks about how he was the oldest skeleton of a <unk> child and what we learn in africa .
and if all of the rules are supposed to be , you need a effective system for <unk> and <unk> because we &apos;ve found we &apos;ve found in everything in everything we need in everything .
it &apos;s been considered high seas because the continent was <unk> <unk> .
we need to work locally , but also the <unk> <unk> .
we need to be a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
i think that was a pretty good idea .
so to say , i &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so i want to design a sketch , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
i finally think we need to think about whether that &apos;s our reality , if we want to make it our reality -- and when what it means for our idea of life and for everything .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and <unk> , the right solution to how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and to explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and earning a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the <unk> of the americans &apos;s population .
we &apos;re going to try to try . probably everything .
<unk> immediately is shut off . &quot;
<unk> used to try it again , but he could never prove the hunch .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is not a very portable .
china has been reached for 20 years .
we don &apos;t even even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yeah , it &apos;s going to be , and yes , it &apos;s happening , and yes , it &apos;s happening -- and we &apos;re more than capable of getting everything that comes to us .
and here &apos;s the game .
and what we need to think is this : if you &apos;re going to dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can take this up on our children , but imagine .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what the cell is the cell in the development of the development .
that &apos;s what &apos;s amazing to do .
everything we have received is <unk> .
they will listen to you that will be able to focus the sensitivity or <unk> , a series of things we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not a thousand years in the distance .
we should outlaw these cheap , simple <unk> , and nobody can use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this .
we can &apos;t risk to the need of losing clients .
he has just got 500 and could have to get 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a giant jar of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come in a week , if you &apos;re sick , if you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things that we all talk about -- is less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the only web days only 5,000 days .
so if we say the machine is that we &apos;re a <unk> , a human brain , a human brain , if we look at the rate that we &apos;re growing on 30 years of <unk> .
now it &apos;s not like -- if you do a chart and stuff at work , you &apos;re not part of the web but you &apos;re going to be it . you &apos;ll be part of the web .
i say , &quot; people will be the <unk> senses of the machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to .
the last thing i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
third , it will be more ubiquitous more ubiquitous , all of our environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second was <unk> of jesus christ was the sun <unk> moon <unk> , and that i was in particular of god , and ready to become his <unk> .
these are the dead of <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes everything seem logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we line things .
this is a project that we just took in <unk> for a giant <unk> built that right now , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that it &apos;s going to evolve .
and that led to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are about to young people &apos;s education .
and lastly , one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of them is about his neighbors .
so when we need to school school school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can impact our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may be surprised , our gut has a <unk> brain .
and these <unk> is very , very important , very important .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain brain , flavor and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , once we had , we were all like animals and then no more . &quot;
these are men and women who can even have 250 stars in the sky sky .
of course , the <unk> of the <unk> were told that .
the <unk> , the <unk> , which is , where the sun is actually a <unk> , which is constantly the <unk> of the <unk> , the holy <unk> of machu picchu , <unk> <unk> picchu .
if you pray for the dead , you &apos;re doing these hands of these hands , they &apos;re up to the hands of these gestures up .
here &apos;s where the big mother has been <unk> into the world , which is the mountains of the world , which is created mountains of the mountains and the country that &apos;s created in the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of the human imagination .
this material that you all know is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s a little bit of the toxic white stuff .
i put in the inside that you fit in , because in a hundred years , my body will come back to the earth without a <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and don &apos;t care about <unk> or <unk> , because you &apos;re so many alternatives .
first , they &apos;re starting atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve been four years ago , and i was a competition called &quot; dance your <unk> . &quot;
my country is 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- that &apos;s a lot of <unk> than all the speakers in front of me and all the ones that are coming to me .
and she thought about my work at mathematical models that we should encourage in evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be <unk> -- from a profound , cultural reasons , they hold it for boring -- and find another pattern of much more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways that we think about .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to a more secular <unk> , because of which you &apos;re dealing with uncertainty .
and only one percent is wrong .
he <unk> : &quot; i suppose that you could be a sudden death in a family &apos;s family . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but it &apos;s pretty unlikely .
the whole quality of the control that has generated the <unk> effects on the industrial process is by statistics .
the <unk> has saved hundreds of thousands of lives , the world &apos;s going .
a conventional lesion doesn &apos;t prevent injury because of electricity , until a smart <unk> is recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . a sense of <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;ve facebook , we have <unk> .
yet , the <unk> itself can produce a very powerful force , which never existed in the history of china .
so , looking at the chinese <unk> as real medium , not just as mere .
like a great ted , not ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> is really changing , and they really did more transparent , because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese will be able to see free of freedom and human rights as their <unk> , instead of being a <unk> privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s ninth symphony was a symphony symphony .
i &apos;m not saying that she &apos;s not a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like its <unk> away from the <unk> to try to see the death of death , which is why the sound was <unk> and his skull has been <unk> on the pages of the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i <unk> myself , in this <unk> audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
this is what the dutch story was in the dutch history of my father &apos;s standing on the bank of the <unk> river in the near <unk> river .
the rate of civil wars and the oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their guns as a tool of peace .
peter van <unk> : why i took a gun
this program gets a shape and then the <unk> of 250 sequences .
this is a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in the midst of the sea .
you can &apos;t let it be . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both of the two .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of it . but there &apos;s actually a theoretical reason for why technology is developed in a <unk> way .
well , evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of the interaction , evolution used to basically the technology of the technology of the technology to create the next stage , which is the first step in the technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can now use a third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent per year , 28 growth in dollars .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
so to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing , at computing , about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to get the full of <unk> of these trends , and they need to celebrate them , how often the <unk> shape was made in the form of technology -- faster and faster , if we get to this point .
you can blessing and <unk> .
they &apos;re harder .
they were from the <unk> away .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not like there &apos;s nothing .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that &apos;s connected to connection with the <unk> .
and we call that a schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post us to post the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought , i &apos;ve got a <unk> in the african <unk> .
9 / 11 has got a <unk> . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own <unk> , and we have a <unk> product .
i wasn &apos;t as good as he , but we managed to do it , <unk> n <unk> , tracy chapman and tracy <unk> and bruce <unk> <unk> on a <unk> for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
they said , &quot; tell us the truth , &quot; and we put us .
musician and activist peter gabriel explains his personal motivation , with the <unk> <unk> of human rights , and shares stories of active <unk> .
so next , we asked us how do this do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing it . the dance is his <unk> , which allows him to get engaged .
the beetle &apos;s putting a lot of a <unk> on the pill when they don &apos;t wear <unk> , when they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our <unk> experimenter .
let &apos;s play a <unk> and see what happens .
this is the universe by stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to fall into this big adventure to fall into this big adventure , right in my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know my grandmother &apos;s next year , a <unk> <unk> antarctica .
so the whole thing of the presentation is to persuade the vc that they are the entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurs in which they invest and make a lot of money .
and next to a experience , a company or something -- it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there &apos;s no environmental companies either , in which there were no problems .
from that , you take them with -- on a solid solid , good path up . right from the end of the end .
if i knew somebody who &apos;s created this as a device .
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition is working on the pattern ...
it was hopefully positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my ideas , you &apos;ll be a <unk> , very <unk> presentation . this is great to <unk> who they &apos;re and to make .
i didn &apos;t know that this is pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a bug .
if you trigger something that you can maybe have a impact .
and if you have enough , you can click another link to another .
we &apos;re at the end of the chart , the last place as the culture , which is not even estimates .
so how we think and we behave , does our <unk> <unk> .
we have a <unk> meme -- serious memes .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very strange .
our thinking is backwards .
through a change , change , like transparency , is change like transparency , such as a <unk> , and collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are made things are being made , the only way to us to get rid of the old <unk> , and new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can bulgaria .
the magazine for <unk> is , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the <unk> , because the <unk> was at the time .
after i had her hand with a gesture of <unk> , she was very -- i got very -- i got my accepted and worked for about six months .
i had nine days ago i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we made several magazines , we did our homework , but we also looked at the way we were surrounded by pictures like this .
this picture literally took a seconds after the baby in the arms , and i was over to the arms that &apos;s been in the arms and i brought it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : it &apos;s not about his miscarriage , but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general belief is that every aspect of my life has gotten better , is better for me to be better , since i <unk> family .
but you realize that you &apos;re in order to lose control of control in a wonderful way , what we mean , our life is very much of what &apos;s been very gratifying and what &apos;s exciting .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s so a episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we all have this &quot; star &quot; <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine , big , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> , as you would personally play personally , john <unk> walker shows how video footage can be <unk> on the exact <unk> and <unk> it can then then you on the <unk> &apos;s wings .
well , since we have a period of extraordinary economic growth , the longest recovery is in the history of this country .
but now a few months later , how well politicians might be in the <unk> , &quot; in the apple &apos;s apple , you can &apos;t bite without the <unk> to <unk> their insecurity , &quot; how it would someone you see , their insecurity .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a <unk> chaotic man who was a <unk> man from <unk> and iron for the <unk> .
but interestingly , also , does this also be a future where society <unk> by a few <unk> capitalism of capitalism , which is how you <unk> the dna <unk> innovation into society , by doing things , and then those who work work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to you today a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new findings that i &apos;ve been working on , about the relationship between the structure of the structure that they &apos;re talking about , and you want to save your tendency to save .
and if i want to talk to you right , it &apos;s forcing me to think about it all the time .
well , this is a unified theory .
so , squeeze that device so she can make you so much with your <unk> hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate across generations to communicate .
we &apos;re english in the <unk> of them .
but i &apos;m about to use it as a vending platform .
but they didn &apos;t have the results that they wanted .
at the same time i was in the field of <unk> , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> <unk> .
people and <unk> and <unk> and birds and birds and all the red line here is high . these are people , livestock and pets .
we &apos;re focused on serious <unk> of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
and the flying day at the party , at the party , and -- you can see how it just <unk> , and you can see each of them you want to .
and he was a <unk> about how people who have heard of religion in india at the time .
and he goes back to the village as a <unk> man .
and he has to his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and it &apos;s so disgusting , and it &apos;s all .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we take us out . we take a sense of a mother and a mom and all that in all of the things that i made .
and you think of how do things are the things if they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re satisfied .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and <unk> other .
although the change in your mindset is something that happens to other beings , you feel that new quality in you , and it helps them , and it &apos;s helps them , and it &apos;s just a model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of mit , one of the society used to be used by society to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very easy if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> , one example , and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop you to stop the details , but in the bottom right corner , you &apos;ll see an example of what we have .
did you start to do that ?
and what &apos;s from doing this is what the <unk> thing is talked about jimmy talked about what our new way of organization is , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will be less to be able to be able to get less in the use of collaboration , in conjunction with the <unk> .
let &apos;s take astronomy , which yochai mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be <unk> , professional arguments .
so it &apos;s going to be no argument of two restaurants , but between these <unk> , there will be all sorts of interesting positions that are taken from people .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to devote their <unk> to someone and actually did a team that was done : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank you for him .
but the truth is that life is right here .
so people called people , and they have news like this one .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman to dress up my anonymity . &quot;
and the one that has no been done , so it turned out that she was just in another city , and a new job , and a new job .
and over the last 35 years , i studied human behavior based on the foundation of all sorts of genes about the <unk> , dopamine and things , to the <unk> .
some of you have it , and it &apos;s about gender .
this was one of those cases , because in her , you had no violence under their ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re like , they &apos;re like , as you can only be .
and i &apos;m going to get an email tomorrow , and we &apos;re in the fact that we &apos;ve sampled the last part of nuclear atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that maybe most least known .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why nuclei together , they &apos;re supposed to be basically , with a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that you have now -- you &apos;ve got it .
the comparison is that the people in this room are the higgs particles .
but it &apos;s really so that with this theory of the physical <unk> at the time of the big bang at the time of the big bang , an absolutely wonderful prediction . the model is not going to make it , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this beautiful image , which is darkness in light , and it allows that to see the civilization of all of the time .
another great insight came from a study of the legacy state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the <unk> player from the <unk> years of looking down .
in a similar study in germany , researchers are <unk> <unk> to measure <unk> <unk> to measure <unk> and after <unk> <unk> into the face of <unk> .
&quot; because the colors you &apos;ve got to do , not the european standard , the european standard , he replied .
&quot; safer ? why ? have more policemen ? &quot;
we built the light <unk> that people , people who were <unk> of <unk> , they were able to think they were in abroad , when they were <unk> to their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; well , i think you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it . &quot;
all over the positions , entrepreneurs would come out of creating entrepreneurs for cellphones .
an illustration of the <unk> power of technology is being found in kibera .
and by 2015 , it will give three billion characters in the world .
in the stores of the environment , the <unk> , batteries and bread <unk> .
this is the <unk> of the time in everything that is embedded in the erosion of a <unk> , in the <unk> that are the rose <unk> .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and also when i look at the big bears , i remember how i look as a child on his head , not to slide on his head , and i feel again like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen seen how creative technology can be and in our lives and our lives , we can innovations the solutions , innovations and moments , the flow of the time , not <unk> the flow of time , but again .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee camp , they had to be soldiers <unk> that my elders brother mark mark mark , and he was nine to take a child child wanted .
and i should do it by doing it .
take something you want to do , from the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> because i don &apos;t mean my feelings .
thank you .
almost everything life is wiped out on earth &apos;s almost <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should it be a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow each organ from some cell to make any cell .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the branches match the same speed with the same speed , the robot is the robot .
and you see how robust control is .
and he does it while he can obstacles .
you take your neighbors right .
this is what we double shows that we double double <unk> , we can make them more , we can form teams , you know , you can see here .
but the robot can actually figure out where he wants to figure out .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much so much , and i want to expand your horizons to the <unk> , consciousness open and their view of honeybees .
so this is for many years , a major problem , in principle , has been the late &apos; late &apos; 80s , which is the late &apos; 80s , bacteria and <unk> <unk> .
you don &apos;t experience that .
the <unk> are taking for their dishes , and the honey -- there &apos;s <unk> -- they use the honey on your bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want it .
okay , now , now , really , is the question : why is this ?
of course , we &apos;ve also got , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before , so many people don &apos;t know that as many people of this matter .
in fact , not many of you don &apos;t know that our bread of the bread of course is not european invention .
and in fact , in <unk> , china is catching up the <unk> high .
<unk> has been <unk> for most people , and there are not many farmers under them that call them , bad to pollute the environment , at large scale , the environment that destroy the environment .
everything is all about together .
and while i finished here , my bread is done -- and i &apos;m <unk> . and i &apos;m trying to get rid of my hands .
and also , to keep the land , to keep in the country with the available resources , materials and <unk> <unk> .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , and we &apos;re using a new technology and testing a new technology , and we think of quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago .
and what do we do ? what &apos;s our answer ?
this is about last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur turned a film about her , <unk> queen , who should see you .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is now <unk> as a <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient , which was the time at the time -- it needed to be a bypass bypass , decided to be a bypass , and decided to this .
i like this slide because you talk about it , what people really motivated to change , and what &apos;s not .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans eat more fat because the ones are even more carbs , so the percentage of lower is the percentage of lower , but the actual number higher , the goal is both to reduce .
one of the <unk> studies studies found that 70 percent of the people were diagnosed , 65 percent of people had bad breath , which is 54 percent had headaches -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , it &apos;s all the way that intimacy <unk> , is <unk> .
i hope it doesn &apos;t depend .
the film is based on a <unk> by f. scott
two <unk> were involved in this project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to make the <unk> and technology technology .
so we <unk> ourselves from motion capture .
the number seemed to be an infinite .
and that &apos;s the data that we get from this , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and this is what the finished picture was used to be used in the film .
that was a very , very early rehearsal . very early rehearsal .
and we found this , in the state of karnataka .
and it &apos;s got a <unk> .
people are going to be these terrible , <unk> past , <unk> past , which they &apos;ve lived for long for their lives .
we were too <unk> -- two of them as a driver -- and imagine it , and imagine it , this is a big sea of sand , 40 degrees fahrenheit , a water bottle .
i think that camel &apos;s best <unk> animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our <unk> .

we &apos;ve got the <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; 60s , turning them into electricity .
<unk> emissions are equivalent emissions emissions emissions , and particles that are doing , and we &apos;re transformed into carbon , and we turned into co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear nuclear nuclear weapons is what nuclear nuclear weapons is about because of us , that india and pakistan <unk> <unk> through <unk> have developed in <unk> developed .
for wind , the area is much larger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?

and the mandatory for the sponsor is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would you be surprised to us , i &apos;m going to be <unk> ?
that means that can be cut itself . you can be incredibly small .
so a challenge was to how we can order this new kind of algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know at the time , because we saw the outside the outside , was that the space continued to <unk> , within the column of column . that was quite surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of the cell division michael <unk> , the incredible , amazing forms of spaces , can create millions of spaces , but you can &apos;t make a person in the surface , but you could build it .

it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually <unk> the chip .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s going to run by young people .
and i think there &apos;s a lot of people in the room , many of them are in the same position of the same position .
so i think women are going to be leaders in our society because they recognize it for their future generations are very important to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve been recognized that since recently and social networks , to give their stories and social networks to show their stories and their own voices with their own voices .
at the same time we invite them to be a <unk> and our part of the world .
so i was more or less than &quot; nothing .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i make these ants some apartment , they &apos;re going to pull them up . &quot;
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i went back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly , is sometimes , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i took it around , and shaped the <unk> .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very high-risk job , but the best things come in little <unk> .
they expect to be told by their employees that they &apos;ve asked them , if they &apos;ve done the job , you can do more extra .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that the primary properties of compassion , and love that nature of the subject is defined .
my <unk> body flew into the direction , my <unk> wheel was in the other .
i made all the <unk> i probably would not do with them to make the <unk> , i didn &apos;t make them a <unk> , the friends i would not look at the <unk> , the <unk> that i could not with them .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you <unk> them from the back of the back , you can just get them down , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> in the filth . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors would cut my leg and hoping , and there was one 15 percent chance .

he &apos;s president of the international union who &apos;s most likely to name , which is the least <unk> name i ever heard .
he was born and a half months early , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .

the long loving the very long , connection that was developed in this long childhood , and the siblings can be developed for the siblings , and that can be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge <unk> of the <unk> woods , and so the pygmies <unk> that <unk> <unk> and there are the ones that <unk> in the <unk> and there are so many hundreds of years ago .

there &apos;s the politicians out of the politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is so quite the same thing , but with a few dozen of different types of molecules -- such a <unk> reduction in the complexity , but the trying to create something <unk> .
she &apos;s actually very <unk> . if you &apos;re going to make yourself , you actually don &apos;t really want to do something .
now , where you &apos;re all experts for these are these are going to be the protocells play play with these protocells .
so we see the self-assembly of these bodies of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black <unk> in this black mud is represent these black mud -- these <unk> , very complex black sludge .
in his lab , martin <unk> , &quot; the protocells , &quot; the <unk> of the chemicals that are living in the chemicals , which is living in the earth first , how life could be done in first , and maybe in other places .
this is a <unk> to take your tadpole for a walk .
what &apos;s the -- where did you know that ? you &apos;ve taken it .
but if we could do that in every fire hydrant , we could redefine the emergency of the emergency .
so , soot is the filth , which is otherwise in her beautiful pink lungs , and the connected is to connect with .
the birds were able to do it from one another .
you can see the <unk> news of him . you can talk to him with him .
but those flock will be a big toll of our planet .
next , we isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working on thousands of years with <unk> , and on products like wine , beer and beer .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re doing it in the world , we see that there &apos;s an universal pursuit of people &apos;s pursuit of the people after that , there &apos;s an universal pursuit .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge amount of energy to produce mobile power .
if we can see that <unk> future , you can see the other .
you had to survive .
and we should be safe to be giving to our school school district to help funding and support for funding and support .
because why would our students grow up so far from their driving ?
it was a book , then a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west coast , they &apos;ve destroyed it .
but in this picture , you see how we started to build the <unk> <unk> , which is a big <unk> in brazil .
when i came to my time , my career started to start my <unk> center of the <unk> art .
if you look at the south of <unk> , you see the expansion of new york city as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white areas are the most of the <unk> places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> places , needed .
maybe there was a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so much force in it , science and visualizing each other is that we have these pictures of being forming . it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we have a really dramatic <unk> level of this society .
so i don &apos;t have to go into it .
you can see the <unk> , which is of course .
this is a <unk> building .
one of the things that we all know is that the mobile phone . right ?
and it turns out to be a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts that help us .
seriously -- clap them -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future of future
you could mean that this was a big problem for a law , but the congress doesn &apos;t seem to be very , very anxious .
if you &apos;re making a lot of the <unk> of making a lot of the <unk> and sold , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we have made of things we &apos;ve found , and every single one is caused by the <unk> of this industry .
that &apos;s the easy thing .
i had a very <unk> , <unk> , expensive education in india , and it &apos;s made me almost did it almost did .
and i thought i &apos;m going to a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and persuasion .
when i said that , they said , &quot; what is possible . what do you do ?
all the electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , as you know , you know , what you should do if you will get arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re an animal .
it &apos;s going to be the tensions that &apos;s going to be there , is a presence of the schools , getting it between teachers and parents , so you can call the <unk> teachers and the parents and say , &quot; give hands hands .
you can use sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mister president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> are creating one of the largest , dynamically <unk> computer in the world for this kind of <unk> .
so you see the <unk> along the <unk> , which we as an artist for the scientists are creating as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there is data of these two groups of people , data , data , how happy they are .
&quot; i don &apos;t think it goes , financially , emotionally , mentally and mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally every other way . &quot;
he was <unk> him for the money , of course , ray six months later , exactly the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used to be used by which i used to be used to you , <unk> , <unk> images .
we collected our materials out of the room and wait half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were <unk> two pictures , and they had two beautiful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of them for meaningful things and we said , &quot; what would you ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> and saying , &quot; you know , we &apos;re giving a <unk> and we can make it in two different ways .
<unk> <unk> , the big car and the <unk> <unk> are beautiful .
voices : it &apos;s going to go into the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition doesn &apos;t come from the <unk> of <unk> , but even further back in a time , before we <unk> stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the sort of <unk> roof , you know .
and so we left my father &apos;s <unk> , because i knew he would kill me , if i go to them , if i let them go . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy , about a blue uniform and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
i &apos;m really trying to do that in the way when i didn &apos;t make a <unk> style to me -- enough to make me <unk> -- enough metaphors for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret <unk> .
she says , &quot; ma , you need to look . &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old woman , even old lady , damn time . &quot;
she &apos;s got up from the car . &quot;
i really fear .
so what is the social result of it ?
where can i go and who together ?
and if we have it , we &apos;ll decide how many miles we drive , where <unk> where we live and work .
smart at the station station at the station of communicating , and you see exactly where you &apos;re on the bus , and when it comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want to say that we &apos;re going to launch the wireless , <unk> , and i urge this network to open standards for everyone .
and they came here in the late &apos; 60s .
and for all of you who come with a mental illness in touch , you know , what can be a challenge for a challenge .
i said i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three , a half of the great share and i wanted to leave them with a <unk> .
because they all were three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey rosey , rosey grier &apos;s just a sane person . and it &apos;s about authenticity .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in <unk> <unk> .
j it &apos;s so many that it &apos;s being a problem .
i thought it was weird to speculate about how it would be a competition to be about a <unk> .
it &apos;s a lot of the merchandise , rich <unk> , who was not the <unk> of the city .
it looks pretty easy , but it was a <unk> .
people were <unk> about two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a sense of the <unk> over the <unk> of the new yorker that i found very emotional .
because if you look at four platforms along the <unk> -- where a <unk> is a tremendous version of a <unk> -- we knew that it had to be mobile to <unk> conditions and the changing definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that children would be judged for each year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody forbid of us here and a concussion <unk> , that most of us would have been in a period of a period of a few hours to a few weeks ago .
you need to know about the problems we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom was a good way to keep a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to keep a 100,000 <unk> .
this is not true , but it happened to be tony blair in 2005 , when his weapon were , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and it &apos;s been described .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that &apos;s going into a <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to <unk> patents for the last 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the company company , the patents to make their patents and make them available for others .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> , people sitting in the <unk> sun , the afternoon in very high , and they didn &apos;t think about it .
they can adjust everything to their well-being .
he gives all these services to , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so little things that you &apos;re going to do is , but for people who are working around the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you do that .
let &apos;s see what he does .
and the husband of the daughter he was also sick with the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .

and most of the ones , with the script and <unk> , they showed up not real social skills in the world -- just the net .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into details , but some of the reasons .
but they &apos;re all the market . and what the market is <unk> in front of the market is particularly demographic .
we &apos;ve found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that are transformed in all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and lots of libraries , like this one .

it &apos;s about gender , which is a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way that really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies of our bodies -- that that separation is created by a division that often created the way that make the challenge .
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s a lot of work with happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s in my <unk> south carolina , who is not much smaller than that &apos;s been born in the way , and even by a future as a british country .
well , maybe he was too <unk> because he was , after he was , after , after the following , went through the nazis , and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .

&quot; aha ! &quot; i said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the movie . &quot;
like , he said to <unk> too much .
and you can right now .
you know , what you &apos;re looking for .
but we care about the most precious cases and order for the next day , and we all order to do that for the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went with , during the time of the soviet union .

we find the <unk> <unk> .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s in seattle . ok .
but i would not drive a child without a <unk> control over my business system .
in some parts of the world , for instance , in south africa , education is just hard to do .

in the way , in particular courses , you can ask those who are most <unk> and how to help students that the students are doing this .
we actually see the beginning of either through a personalized <unk> or by <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what was my first thought of what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , it &apos;s mainly mainly about to make the reality of others .
i have a doubt about the value of the romantic science . such as rationality , it &apos;s expected to expect you in a rational rational way .
so , you can understand my surprise when i had the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , said , &quot; <unk> <unk> is his <unk> .
i think you can do about those funny ones that have not been about the ones , and not about the ones that don &apos;t have , right ? i &apos;m not a jokes about quoting <unk> , and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> right now that i &apos;ll tell you .
he said , i had to pay for a lot more , because it &apos;s going to 18 years old to 18 years to get a really good <unk> .
huh ? yes ? what ? i &apos;m not going to hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid of this , that &apos;s active .
i thought about the imam of the time thinking about the beauty that you &apos;re told yesterday , because the <unk> in his book says that can &apos;t be able to make beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs are , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer in the world at the idea -- well , well , or very few astronomers astronomers -- that there are planets outside our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he <unk> the time with a particle accelerator that would go wrong with a particle accelerator and a <unk> that could destroyed the world .
we need to do the <unk> same as the <unk> same .
so , we don &apos;t want to see .
so what can we do about it ?
and now the worst thing .
we spend a lot of money on that , we make sure we don &apos;t have a <unk> die , but we don &apos;t give anything out . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get back to the wrong foot .
i hope that this is going to be .
and this is very , very important , because this is the system , the <unk> , which is the life of the life on the planet , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing knowledge . and we know it &apos;s just recently about it .
and that &apos;s what the system of <unk> , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles , in these circles .
anyone who later comes to this database , and can just get the information that needed to , for everything , is needed to .
we &apos;re about to <unk> the wave , the technology possibilities .
in the earthquake , there are large amounts of these new microbes that we never looked at before the sea floor .
the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that our oceans for the global , interactive lab lab -- and the <unk> over the world &apos;s deep trigger .
so i think that optimism is going forward the architecture .
so again , radical is against conservative .
the <unk> against the higgs process , you know , too often , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know , it &apos;s true ; it &apos;s ; it &apos;s ; it &apos;s always unexpected , always .
but i &apos;d rather be a completely unknown , and even with mistakes , so instead of having errors , so that &apos;s how it &apos;s from its <unk> .
risks in rooms which are never as <unk> as it was in a very <unk> town .
there is the emotions of the victim .
daniel <unk> builds very big ideas . he calls 17 terms of terms of the vision of the architecture that his vision of architecture is to basically -- is raw , <unk> , radical -- and inspiration for every bold of bold creative goals .
it &apos;s also the lowest <unk> of all the cars .
does something really , really , or will have a few more <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s just to be . if not , we &apos;re in trouble in a big trouble .
with this capital , and then solarcity , solarcity , the <unk> on the roof , and then the <unk> or a monthly <unk> <unk> is the lower one than the <unk> .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve got 2008 .
it &apos;s like a jet jet .
how to all the world could be innovative for a person &apos;s most innovative ?
look at that .
boy , if you &apos;re pumping our livestock , and you can see a <unk> , like he eats one of our goats , is it very nervous .
we &apos;re hungry .
our tradition looks like this : in every <unk> there &apos;s a holy fire .
so far , we were dealing with support of the world wildlife fund , which is to move very little programs with <unk> .
so , also , we invest in the money on the enlightenment , over aids and hiv .
<unk> -- again , a <unk> of many in the world of <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful agent .
and we hide that price behind the giant .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> lead to <unk> <unk> revolution .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
the science is the world through the mind , and the minds , things can be , and we can have the art of a framework for knowledge and knowledge .
from the plan of a few cameras , after three weeks , a plan for three weeks .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
so that wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> photographer , a photo of the <unk> , right ? but sometimes it has to be the way to show the dimensions of what the dimensions of it .
here &apos;s how the glacier back back , the glacier back .
so this is what several cameras saw .
could india be the origin of the origin or a global center for innovation , just as a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
when we asked to talk about people in the <unk> , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on the other products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor , if you didn &apos;t even student .
the best hospitals that were going to be in the doctors for cancer , as the doctors , <unk> , <unk> , artificial <unk> , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a <unk> <unk> for four a.m. .
i said a <unk> message when i see a look .
everyone in our society is coming in with cancer -- if not personal , then through a beloved people , a member of mine , a member of mine , a friend , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve been in the lab fields in the lab at about 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect on all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in the sixth month , the tumor has responded to the tumor , and he starts <unk> .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new <unk> , a new project .
in fact , she &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and it &apos;s a pipe pipe , and it &apos;s from her .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , soon it &apos;s going to look like this .
somewhere running a stream or a <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english , we have <unk> and <unk> .
and you still need to get off .
these are the beautiful stages of stairs that we saw on one of the images .
and <unk> is 27 percent reduction in size : 600,000 times people have a year of hiv hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in the textiles , which people come from the <unk> and they &apos;re going to go to industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries at the right , you see the <unk> , and the principle has every country with a <unk> of saying , we &apos;re less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of saying we three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew not so much .
buy african products .
but i think that a lot of bigger problem is that this is the logic -- we &apos;re ipods and not bombs to get bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas <unk> .
and so 500 people have chosen and four of them were chosen to visit the institution , and they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , and they &apos;re going to <unk> them up to them .
now , now , now , in terms of planning by 2020 , we &apos;re not necessarily going to change anything , because it &apos;s still the dictators that control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : the internet is <unk> worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was carrying a younger people around .
because for me , who was <unk> in this time and in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; do you want ? &quot; or sex or drugs we didn &apos;t .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and also politicians and <unk> , i &apos;m pretty much about the <unk> that our country is , concerned , all the talk about india as new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , all sorts of stories tell us about countries about countries , independent , independent , whether they come to the day or not .
but the lightning in our country at that time , quite slowly , it took about half an hour to be a call <unk> .
she can &apos;t understand the idea .
this can have been statistical consequences . ok .
and those of you who have the money here you have to be surprised to see how many <unk> on the <unk> are there that the <unk> will explain .
i went home and i was researching a little bit . i found some of the startling statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water .
and i feel like george bush .
well , this title , this is a <unk> , a early critic , a early critics and this is a passage that i love , and i &apos;d like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be like , mother &apos;s nature , a problem : how to get everything in the world , to mate chimpanzees ?
this is the hardest part of which is not obvious , and so i got it for the end of the end .
ok ? stop . this is going to take .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> <unk> , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i suspect the most likely probably quite many reasons , why we know the most new things , very quickly , i want to be a very quick way of .
it &apos;s <unk> that look like this .
bob mckim has another very -- another version of this practice made in a pretty famous experiment in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that time , you can get a much better , much more creative results when all the rules are holding to the rules .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit like , i &apos;ll get back to it .
you know , what it feels like , all of the uncertainty , as long as you get in the corridor back , <unk> during the corridor of a <unk> , and you wonder what &apos;s going on here .
so , by all , we would feel secure and have a good time because we agreed about the rules and so that would be agreed .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re here , we believe that we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re going to refuse to get happy and just just just to do that .
i was faster , but as depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is simply full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully my god , &quot; hopefully , the last time in the public .
he made sure that all fit together .
it took 900 people in part .
and the second thing is that people seem to experience a real connection .
these are questions .
as you can see in modern liberal democracies , the society allowed us to determine the state , the state of us not just to shape our own , but it also does it by us .
it means that we &apos;re our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that are kind of asking , the kinds of questions that i wanted to take you today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use when they design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian <unk> us that there must be better .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;m going to give you one in the fall .
he put them in the right position , she <unk> her nose and beating it in the right position .
we learned the first surprise .
there &apos;s to be a kind of <unk> to make the <unk> amount of power and speed the speed of the system that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load load of forces , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> load cell with a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and it &apos;s going to get <unk> and the load cell .
a very , very appropriate solution for the problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s the ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classic <unk> built that ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> , who just benefit from that this three-dimensional space .
now you can see that -- it &apos;s just just let me face .
the submarine that &apos;s last year , is this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , and forgive the obvious example -- is not the right thing we need to vote .
basically , new york has been built on the back of the <unk> , our streets via their shells .
in these eight <unk> , they &apos;re little <unk> that are essentially <unk> .
so you walked in london and was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
then , snow snow had a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in 1972 , in 1972 oil .
the other side of the field is <unk> <unk> where to actually osama bin laden &apos;s supposed to stop . this is <unk> .
this was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me continue to show you the hubble <unk> of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and the one is 40 minutes , that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part of the beginning of the universe .
we have just a million galaxies .
so the stuff that &apos;s white is now appears to dark matter .
when you saw that image for the first time , you haven &apos;t seen a lot of it .
this simulation has been done with 1,000 processors for a month just to make this visible .
with a <unk> , we hope we &apos;re a resolution that &apos;s about this image of the earth , which is that you can actually see the complicated patterns of earth that can recognize the earth .
and we &apos;ve been stressed out in the aftermath of course .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we do this all the time , even in the daily life .
i went into a vicious cycle . and so i led to a lot of pain and problems with the joints , so that i could make anything more .
so i asked myself , could be creative , if you look at the limitations for the limitations ?
this is not going to happen in tomorrow .
the <unk> is <unk> , as as a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> police <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> famine <unk> <unk> , killing millions of <unk> . in the &apos; 40s , they were watched the nazis for the nazis , the nazis , were <unk> . many women were <unk> at the germany of germany .
the reason is the grief for the time . &quot;
and as a filmmaker , i was excited about the idea of most of the virtual world that we learned in the virtual world over us , and over our identity , we could have to live a better life in the real world .
we used to be a new way of being in common alone .
human relationships are selfish , messy and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
because at the moment , in which people alone are alone for a few seconds , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re going to take a lot of a <unk> .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently we didn &apos;t have any of any time in the <unk> who had some of our students predicted , and quite often -- -- quite often , i felt that they had had had their predictions on the financial kind of <unk> .
maybe because my father always read it .
so i made them in calm -- but she &apos;s got <unk> and she was just to be <unk> .
and finally , i thought , &quot; but i &apos;m not here at the time , but i &apos;m not here .
although you &apos;re losing , not fear of failure , if we have all given the rest of failure , because who can give you more desire to than anything he can do .
if i &apos;m called the name , i don &apos;t know an answer .
i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge was to cells .
today , in many clinical trials , we &apos;re now trying different kinds of stem cells for heart disease .
last month , it &apos;s only been able to show us with this technology to show the creation of human rights .
we can map them and then around 360 degrees , and so the kidney is in all its parts of these parts , then we can just take this information and then print through 3d printing .
i couldn &apos;t even have a <unk> . i just went to dirty .
i was a kid , i said , as i , like , &quot; yes , i want to . i want to this operation .
you might notice that a new area is developed by the <unk> .
and connected with these <unk> , there were examples of a president around the world -- from the election of a president to the <unk> wikipedia and everything in between -- the showed that the power of a lot could achieve .
third , <unk> , <unk> issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd ; i want the music to play .
i mean , hot and i &apos;m a member of kenya .
we need to our wives and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure infrastructure .
late at night , i went home with batteries and ice ice .
together , does anybody have <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country to get the master &apos;s master and working in a working working in work that &apos;s going to be .
this can be huge spending , but if the city can be a number of x volunteers for five hours to win , the <unk> of the <unk> work is to the <unk> of the city &apos;s labor .
they have <unk> , charts and data .
so these are the 18 minutes that are going to be <unk> to me here , between two and <unk> people who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> mud .
the buildings here are several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;re in political activity , you &apos;re in the political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i was part of a technological revolution that would be true that dream will make that dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same time i helped me through their careers , <unk> franchise in the <unk> of <unk> .
at the time , <unk> normally , normally , with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read every <unk> .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to me to read my machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , to the different <unk> countries : u.k. u.k. , canada , canada , australia had to have different kinds of <unk> of harry potter have to have .
the <unk> rate . has been more than more than doubled than doubled , and it &apos;s growing over more and more than it grows at the speed of five hours a day .
another thing . do you want to be a <unk> . you want to people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new machine is good news , because , once the androids are taking work , we don &apos;t have to do it , and that &apos;s what we do , and that , <unk> .
the societal challenges are being on this inequality .
the commercial model are surprisingly clear , and surprisingly , straightforward , particularly in short .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with <unk> technologies , embedded technologies , embedded in a little society and <unk> through a economy that inequality is more .
over the course of the years , i started to feel more and more <unk> to feel more <unk> .
some have <unk> that we could only believe in a god that &apos;s the pain of the pain .
in the second , the line comes to the line , &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking at the god inside , by my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the <unk> technology technology technology . &quot; technology . &quot;
we have no <unk> found that older than 40 years were , and the average age of these hunter-gatherer peoples and german peoples are 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies have been used to these new diet .
so this is what you have shown of energy and matter , the einstein has shown and also the modern science system shows that entropy and information and matter and energy and matter and energy and all of energy and energy and all together , it &apos;s a long continuum .
so that &apos;s a robot that wants to work its own plug in order to get more electricity .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great evolution that has begun to take billions of years ago , moving through us and sit on . and our choice is kind of , in the technology , is really much more powerful to us , is really , to make us with this force that much more powerful than we .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classes 30 to 40 students .
we cut this all down and found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had -- as we &apos;ve heard , &quot; you know what the hull is like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we were sitting on the table tables and have waited .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , particularly for the adults who work at work that were really known as they started to have a toilet .
the teachers who work with us -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
there &apos;s about 170 tutors with them on the book , and so this is wonderful work .
and right now -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind the saw -- just like children &apos;s been teaching .
there &apos;s also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in <unk> , but it &apos;s opening up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s got his wife .
he writes an email ; he &apos;ll give you any question you can answer every question .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a page that thinks that the peace is the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a side that &apos;s thinking that the peace is creating schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- i found a new home .
there &apos;s also one , the manual for all of us , &quot; did that ?
there &apos;s <unk> roads on the cape streets , and we all can drive here .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you .
he said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i &apos;ve always felt bad about it .
so i was a kind of complications .
i found that these are very good <unk> .
the university is most difficult , so it &apos;s number 10 to do .
in fact , in a strange <unk> , about a <unk> <unk> , which is a window of interval to the moment that the street had been black <unk> and sent these white <unk> there in the sun .
and i was being done by the great presentation by karen armstrong reminds that religion really understood nothing to believe , but with behavior .
the <unk> has to be geographically , geographically , same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s got the same size as the united states , the <unk> of an area that &apos;s about the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the place .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> to the <unk> , the australia , to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have through the assumption of that challenge .
before i show you some images , i want to show you this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
and the worst school is really an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve been working with keith <unk> tomorrow , many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful to their talks to be beautiful in the way , scared of being <unk> .
so here you can make it in 3d already , which is very interesting .
so that lets you think about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge of us as a physicist , as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces of the <unk> more , and you &apos;re still weaker .
&quot; <unk> 7 &quot; <unk> a whole band .
and there are some staff in foundations that &apos;s called this <unk> .
the idea of justice , which is how our lives are , and we feel a sense of what &apos;s really in life , which is what is just about in life , what we should do , social justice .
and like that , he &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s during the <unk> .
so every week , the <unk> came in , &quot; god , you &apos;ve heard me . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or a operation .
the muscles were <unk> , paralyzed -- <unk> call <unk> .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- the one , frankly , in this kind of pain , are not very effective .
now , they &apos;re so slowly a sense of how much rock we talk about here .
it was 1908 . it doesn &apos;t . so that i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back rows of all at all . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called &quot; deep impact , &quot; which is a -- the <unk> impact -- which is a part of the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts like , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and we &apos;re having that we have a <unk> and vote , and we can change our future .
and i was going to be <unk> , the only independent independent , to be the right independent medium of the country .
and i thought that was <unk> , and a great company would be , if <unk> was gone , what was really made up when they did .
and at the end of the meeting he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you will never see your money back again , but my foundation will get 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re going to meet your business business , what they actually did .
look , we &apos;ve started looking at the east and we &apos;ve started working on russia with work .
after a while we opened a little <unk> .
and we have the idea of going on , going to spend on the open press , we want to leave the free press .
and in this way , you &apos;re in the funding , you know , there &apos;s no <unk> , no blind to find themselves .
so , why does this work like this ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some call it &apos;s a theory of everything .
just like this : newton &apos;s thought , newton &apos;s law , that works like one divided by the square of the <unk> between the one hand , between the one hand of the <unk> objects .
the more you have the more symmetry , the better you , the simplicity and elegance .
one thing that he thought was taking most of us today , but at the time , this was not for granted .
it doesn &apos;t <unk> the meaning of these conventions that they follow <unk> laws , and accidents .
but he read in every time he had , books .
by this ambition , he went back to the <unk> .
but when he was just about to put his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf and <unk> , because he would be a thousand hands during a morning .
not surprisingly , it was just three women under the 16 house <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , i was the older i got , i understand what was incredible privilege to be , with this aging lion of a man so many hours .
and as lincoln lincoln was telling the story , went to the war after the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
and what &apos;s the reason that i &apos;m always grateful for is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to be the story of the back to the time .
he had <unk> the temple and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the proof of that the jews in babylon , after all the years that they were in the north of babylon , after all that years , they were sitting in the rivers of the rivers , and at the memory of jerusalem , that these <unk> were <unk> home .
all these are being respected by cyrus .
the cylinder is cylinder is by the priests of the great <unk> of <unk> <unk> , marduk , written .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of living in iran are jewish in the <unk> jews .
some more of the lives more about the lives of life , but they think they &apos;re a <unk> .
the newly <unk> babies cried for the first few hours , but their needs were not going to be done and eventually they learned to try to try and get them in less days , and they were <unk> and <unk> in the air , like everyone else .
a study shows that 10 percent of a cost cost , whereas <unk> about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost my whole life on a camera .
you know , you know quite quickly , you have to find an answer .
it was <unk> people -- most of them are friends and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course he never came . it didn &apos;t happen .
and after many , many meetings was excited , that man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it managed to get rid of the unicef of the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in the peace and <unk> of them , etc . -- and they got some of him .
we connect to <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; at the london 2012 , we &apos;re going to fight the vote .
it &apos;s about their <unk> , and they &apos;re about business .
the biggest majority of the world should be the cognitively possible most of the world .
i &apos;m <unk> the literature after the origin of these numbers , but i couldn &apos;t have them .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , what our ancestors would probably be about a 1.5 million years ago when they discovered that they discovered what our ancestors would discover a billion ago when they discovered .
rather simple opportunities for the <unk> conversations that i did .
and i think i &apos;m just beginning to stand at the beginning .
but once the struggle for the fighting , the physical rehabilitation is .
and he was a kid behind him his son , in his face , in a face , his father &apos;s face in a face , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
and the evening i spoke to my bosses in the headquarters and i told them -- i <unk> -- i <unk> them , &quot; look , we &apos;ll start with a couple of hours every day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of <unk> started to fight .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , we need to increase the production of feet of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the center of the center , but it &apos;s also in the houses of people .
and you should see me as a <unk> .
and this hospital could have been able to afford to <unk> .
why ? because the way i had taken , was not .
but i learned something that was the leader of the world -- namely , the leader -- the manager of the economy -- the incredibly bad decisions that we had in the <unk> .
because i knew that the state of african continent is for my children and whose children would be important .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had to get at swarthmore .
is my time up to get up ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment where a great society can rise within one generation .
you know , it &apos;s the <unk> yellow ball of very similar -- the sun &apos;s yellow ball -- the sun is that we draw as a child .
in fact , this is something that half of them , more than half , is not being familiar with more familiar .
32 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . &quot;
and these are the messages that they &apos;re communicating ?
because , in the end , the sponsors love love , and he &apos;s going to put it on the time on television .
a professional <unk> , the <unk> of dead , they won &apos;t reach me ?
what &apos;s <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to make suggestions of people , how to <unk> , and <unk> and community government , and they put them doing something .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is just about a <unk> generator for the generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but this is how the user control control is whether there &apos;s electricity or not because you can control the <unk> on the ground , how much percentage of you are .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can do with that medical care .
the different kinds of writing in africa , the first one was <unk> , like the typeface <unk> shows what the <unk> of a secret society is in <unk> .
at least until 1998 , when a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , who discovered centuries ago before the <unk> bc were <unk> centuries ago .
almost a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions is from the <unk> -- that &apos;s more than from traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the animal , to <unk> and animals on the assembly line , like tools to produce the assembly line , it &apos;s not just that .
<unk> was a <unk> issue .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would mean that maybe that maybe not so bad .
i asked about a year ago , &quot; why am i , although i know , although i know what i know is not a vegetarian ? &quot;
the weekend is you have the choice .
you can make an image with an iphone and all the name , although it &apos;s sometimes making mistakes .
they won &apos;t . he &apos;ll win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it &apos;s from interest to find more about it , if the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- an sunset or a big artwork .
the human nature is to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level of the very <unk> level of what we have in -- is that they &apos;re intrinsic .
it could be more complicated to people , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i knew i something about the control control .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that you can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio studio .
we take the pizza , our first , our first pizza , and <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the hallway , we &apos;re <unk> .
i was a certain 20 before i first went first to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you to take the work .
it &apos;s not photoshop work .
they were interested in a novel to create alternatives , alternatives to create alternatives , and they needed money to make some interesting work to make some interesting work .
this project called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and did this , it was a little -- the attention that we got .
and she describes how the <unk> -- all you say is , you know , it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s related to origami . so .
people are used mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles of the underlying principles .
or they put it on top , and they &apos;re 50 stars on a flag with 13 <unk> .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that you &apos;re putting in circles , you covered the <unk> with the lines of the lines , the extra rules .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need something to do something .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> state in washington with a lot of time for a lot of time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about hours of hours .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , it will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see is -- it starts in 1973 -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> the market market , and it goes on to the day .
you were , there were <unk> .
because i write about all the book i write , i &apos;m still , and i don &apos;t answer the answer .
and that was very disheartening for them .
because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , come back to us in form of culture , in this weird and some sort of <unk> way where you can see that they change .
there &apos;s no man or not a woman who is in the middle , and it &apos;s about to the <unk> .
while the personal income is on a scale , which has been accepted to account the inflation to account the inflation , in this time , almost tripled .
and to hear me , and i understand what i say , you know about 60 bits per second .
so , again , it &apos;s going to happen , so in the last book , &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceos in the world who are very successful and very ethical <unk> , with great social sense .
control is always a safe thing , because you &apos;re not in your mind , but not very much .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning of what &apos;s home . they had their sense for community , and even for the <unk> , which was born from birth to <unk> . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond it .
more and more people are in the future or present the present , like the past .
i went down to the room that i &apos;m supposed to sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where &apos;s home where is you home ?
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why i &apos;m going to <unk> , digital technology is <unk> .
that &apos;s where the children are the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; your brits and your mortality in heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but if you have to <unk> people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started to work with <unk> <unk> , and they were growing , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice that could not make the gene .
one of the subjects was my mom , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she &apos;s .
could you be good at the summer as well as good .
certainly , many advances , many advances live .
this is actually a real photograph , the <unk> , which shows that this is within less days .
and here on the right , what six months later is that , technically , the technically <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> is comprised of two different types of types .
we put it back into this oven-like device .
even more complex organs , and the most complex solid organs are the high <unk> of organs that are highly <unk> , with every amount of <unk> organs , like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not yet , and no tumors form .
we need only five seconds .
for every problem , someone &apos;s ever had an idea .
so i &apos;m just a little bit of panic -- unlike all of the <unk> and sugar that i had -- but this is an entrepreneur for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you need to visit a <unk> .
i went from door to door and sold <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
it &apos;s useless . &quot; you need to find a way to find out faster .
i sold a lot of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the opportunity to find other tasks , and they learn the ability of the <unk> , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and bad it is going to show you what bad looks like .
these young , <unk> .
the evolution of the world &apos;s students is , all the way out of a flock of reading .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> are <unk> by the most of our students .
the values of the past are also <unk> . that &apos;s a lot of society .

biochemist mullis : discusses modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 1600s and out of his own <unk> in the garden and <unk> curiosity in all their <unk> and <unk> curiosity in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a simple kind of living body that these <unk> , decrepit spaces of occupied spaces , decrepit spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a nickname for new york and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; the <unk> and <unk> that made out of the sense of the <unk> in a urban environment .
i love it to travel , and berlin is one of my <unk> .
and the whole time i &apos;ve been about , i don &apos;t only have a rat at any of these places until recently , when i was in the london &apos;s london .
the first question is , and maybe you &apos;re writing it up , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual leaf in your head , and you can see that you can do that .
and we stop working with , &quot; we &apos;re the best <unk> school school , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you &apos;re nodding -- well , in your <unk> , you thought , &quot; what &apos;s happening during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is , when people have a notion of how it works , it &apos;s quite hard to change this .
and as an expert , i &apos;ve got friends and colleagues that are different between the organic , living world between the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , he &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , grows in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a letter to a fellow who probably lives that life was probably going somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what &apos;s the stuff ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands of really big <unk> molecules , in the same size of dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in the way that is not carbon .
we want to put them into the environment , and we want to make it your energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and matter to make matter , <unk> , then that will be life in the way that we &apos;re in .
there &apos;s a second reason why i like this <unk> : every one you can measure .
and these are highly professional female interviewer who wanted an hour for an hour , and she asked her to her question of the <unk> question .
i was sitting on friday in the friday , and i could see the <unk> of this morning of <unk> on the morning of <unk> .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want to keep more and more of it .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make a sense of a <unk> , from a <unk> improvement , which is not a very quick progress .
but you don &apos;t talk so much .
there were high , or very high , child mortality and the families were very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s also the way .
whatever is worth more value for money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he said , &quot; is the <unk> question .
all the time was a border .
and <unk> , after my mind , the world will bring a difference to make a difference , not just for a few of them , but for everyone .
... on the top , the knee , yes , that &apos;s hard ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everyone &apos;s needs , but not everyone &apos;s greed .
and <unk> .
i went to high school .
when i was the council of scientific research , when i was research , 40 laboratories -- when two <unk> were not working together , i built teams .
they &apos;ve been there , and now i have apps apps on the app store .
it &apos;s about to perfect an old and an old thing to perfect the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more <unk> .
because this reactor is not under high pressure and chemically <unk> , meaning that the <unk> doesn &apos;t tend to leave the reactor .
i believe that the reactor that i designed here is a cutting-edge energy for being the great <unk> of projects with electricity , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move into a <unk> where the experience is the real product .
there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , for the case they go in the forest .
so , at the end of a long time , good advice he &apos;s <unk> his son , he says this : &quot; especially , is <unk> against you .
usually you don &apos;t normally go in in a <unk> way , but there &apos;s a place where you can run a lot of it out there , outside this city .
then they &apos;re going to be wrong as a <unk> -- by making properties of traits that they don &apos;t have .
when i was a little , i was very introverted , and i &apos;d like to just like to go for me .
then it was just about to start at a point and then you to build them up to the end .
so i made it out of concrete because it &apos;s actually no matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , the most important thing , because i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the <unk> developed <unk> <unk> <unk> , arms and hands up 36 days : the primitive <unk> begins to train these weeks , where the fetus evolves .
the complexity of this individual is in a single system , again , beyond each other , or any of every time in the existing math .
because apparently there is this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stars .
so what can you make with these spectra ?
and the other day i sent a colleague from berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you see this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- and over <unk> and <unk> stars -- where matter and chemical elements in the universe are made and regenerate .
because can you imagine that all the <unk> ?
now imagine a object , an incredible object , or something we can &apos;t do , and we &apos;re just saying , &quot; so , we &apos;re not going to give it . &quot; physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see <unk> , oxygen , then i think we have the perfect question of my perfect .
i mean , just like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about is it universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a little collapse -- -- actually , actually , like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is , no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what &apos;s the feeling being vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t . shut up .
we pretend what we do , as we did , no impact on other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter that were <unk> their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , you know , making systematic improvements , we think we think about how to be useful , for the <unk> and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so , steven is a story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i love that <unk> , and also these <unk> , these were the only ones that were online and available online .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any <unk> , you don &apos;t have data , it &apos;s not going to be scientific methods .
this is the curve &apos;s <unk> .
but my brother not , he went to the end .
if we went to the <unk> today , we would put on something that &apos;s 300 feet tall , 120 miles , 20 miles wide , and the two half is wide , and the two degrees of it weighs .
to change the state , you need only two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do that better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s called what &apos;s called the <unk> .
these are networks networks are <unk> complex systems .
and it also has the implications for systemic risk .
so we could give each other <unk> to each other .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that are <unk> on the world , our world &apos;s leading to understand the point of view of the standpoint of the complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity to do with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and the valves .
and we had 500 of these <unk> prepared .
without human <unk> .
so we were on top of our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s data is invented .
and my brain starts to think very quickly , that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> &apos;s representation in the world .
because that question is going ahead , that our external world can make our <unk> world , but the truth is that i only can predict 10 percent of the <unk> of a person &apos;s point when i can predict the entire external world .
and this is two reasons scientifically , and <unk> around the world .
we move people to do their <unk> open , and a positive email from the <unk> or the <unk> of somebody in your social environment .
hard to say -- a <unk> , you know -- my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and so i went to the mit , i went to mit .
they said , &quot; do it stop .
they take a giant disk in cardboard .
he was the first digital <unk> in tokyo .
listen ? how cows ? this is how cows ? this is the morning in <unk> .
so there &apos;s all these things that are doing , but most of the love i love to experience the world , too .
and i was following the passion with passion .
their culture is not in schools . and i want to see you see how we can overcome this problem .
so that &apos;s because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools that there &apos;s no boys in which there are no boys .
and i think about small moments in my life .
or mothers , who are raised young ?
we need to change the attitudes of an inner elementary school in elementary school .
and you have the idea that you think that would be okay .
let &apos;s take a look where we &apos;re going to get this hypothesis .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give us this , why , &quot; <unk> evidence of the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me to do not .
we have a newspaper created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s a radio with my ipad , and that &apos;s a piece of software that &apos;s going on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> -- so i &apos;m so <unk> to a <unk> , so that people respond to the glass in the glass , when you get to the core .
i &apos;m going to turn into a man &apos;s middle-aged age , and then in an old man .
<unk> extra extra extra allowed .
radio : what do you think about it ?
just folding them up the wings and drive them .
so i ask you another question .
and he had a <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , who had instruction , it was a day and night , but with the secret instruction , it doesn &apos;t particularly good good at <unk> .
because they &apos;ve found that <unk> human behavior is stronger .
yet , we need to create a <unk> <unk> , which you can create that kind of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair to do .
so if we all have these tools available to have to ask us the question -- and thaler and <unk> , and we did these intelligent devices .
they &apos;re going to lead the new <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt passion , the soul and heart , had my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; without &quot; no . &quot;
all around us , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , another replicator in this culture is the culture of culture .
you probably have bought them .
imagine the world &apos;s full of brains , and more memes than space for them all .
we &apos;re the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
it was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to make the resource of the planet , to produce more and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and we &apos;re going to see this third danger , how we &apos;ve got the second and first ?
in conjunction with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the ministry of public <unk> , with various <unk> , with various <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> more than 1,500 buildings .
it doesn &apos;t cost us more , if we do it right . &quot;
and because i was <unk> 70 percent of my body , took an hour , it took an hour .
we also have that it was good , if you could have me , i would give myself to the <unk> of the pain .
and how bad would the sentence , if i was caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the <unk> people -- who had more commandments -- less than <unk> , and that &apos;s the less religious -- those less religious -- those who could not remember anything -- more <unk> .
so if you don &apos;t think for a couple of seconds you &apos;re just about cash , because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think that all these forces very bad have the market stock market .
but you can believe in the commercial commercial . i work in the commercial .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly , amazon and competing for brand <unk> , is defined by how you spend your money on what money is , what money is , and what it is .
maybe it seems to be a big leap ?
the audience to me , i won &apos;t probably tell you -- last week i had to make it -- i &apos;m <unk> of these kids -- <unk> , the sperm from an individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> , or even most of the animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissues , by using bone .
and that was that every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found out to <unk> in nature , across the same <unk> .
all i showed that was really surprised this .
a funny song about global warming , by jill .
well , i need to probably know .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; they &apos;re the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> totally <unk> and ben became a <unk> .
so , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home to the democratic republic of the congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> has the <unk> of the united nations , the power of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to be very inexpensive .
but wouldn &apos;t it be done for this angle of <unk> ?
they demanded of the governments and <unk> , and in many cases they have them .
but let &apos;s take a time , our goal would make new economic act to the ground of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profit .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed .
since the <unk> , when sir <unk> , and the british society for <unk> means that the sun seems to be it .
so what &apos;s fusion is ? here &apos;s something <unk> .
and this is what energy is .
so , something like conventional <unk> .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the biggest arab country and is also a big impact .
they wanted to be the most democracy they were , but they were all countries who were at the <unk> in the last month , their opinion had to be said to a civil servant -- it was only four percent .
but the expectation of people in the future is significant .
so the question is , &quot; what will the men do for women for women ? &quot;
i promise you , she &apos;s got the message .
nobody can listen to them , they &apos;re just sending a text .
you could see the immediate effects of the laws of the world or the <unk> speech , and what &apos;s going on as a result .
flight took 12 seconds and went through 35 .
this is a rocket for a rocket .
it &apos;s less than a <unk> .
the smallest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forces the nature of nature .
we can afford to be an individual contributions and we heard about it .
we think that somebody else is different , somebody <unk> , somebody who &apos;s <unk> , somebody who &apos;s going to solve this problem .
we flew it into the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes to us something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s this incredible <unk> of what &apos;s possible , and this is what &apos;s possible , and this is what it means .
and we think we think about our moral space .
and the director was quite , and he said to me that he was <unk> me for crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are very severe .
it took several things to me , until i figured out what i was supposed to do .
when i was four years ago , my <unk> plan was a <unk> plan of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and they look down to <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i was 15 years ago , the courage i put my lectures on nyu , and my home country where i was doing this incredible trip to this group of <unk> children &apos;s <unk> and <unk> and russia .
and how many times i would die , before i could understand that it was not there from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly enough , <unk> these findings , my <unk> self-worth , that feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have any myself , what was in between .
imagine that what kind of existence we could have if we honor the <unk> of the self , the privilege of life , and what &apos;s the privilege of what &apos;s going on .
and this is a cafe in the sea in the u.k.
but instead of looking at that , we focused on how much .
and we also discovered that as a <unk> structure , how a <unk> structure would be through this structure .
but we found that seed -- this is really important , this really important project , instead of -- but that seeds -- in the leading <unk> gardens , seed seed issued .
we worked with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of the seed seed , so that , even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it &apos;s kind of <unk> and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s just the first couple of the ones that you &apos;re aware of , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate &quot; &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea is a blank slate of the human mind , and all his structure of the socialization of its socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of a political reasons that they &apos;re good for people .
it &apos;s not even clear that these projections are actually <unk> , but then the <unk> seemed to be able to support these kinds of water .
another <unk> and <unk> at the universities that are actually in most of the universities in the decline in the decline .
well , the other hot iron iron is the afterlife .
and i think you can &apos;t tell it better .
i &apos;m also going to <unk> <unk> , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but it &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m living in a computer program -- that &apos;s weird .
so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people who are the same skin , the same circuit , the same keyboard , always over and over again .
and then it &apos;s got bigger and <unk> and <unk> , and now it &apos;s <unk> pages .
and i said to brian , &quot; what tony did tony ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you &apos;re in ? &quot;
but how do you do a mentally normal way ?
so , all of these things that were introduced to the <unk> <unk> , proof of his own , he was that he was going crazy to this new kind of crazy .
he came in <unk> in <unk> , <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , american cities just like this in <unk> .
and i added to , &quot; i have a list of <unk> features in my pocket .
and the freudian aspects of the personality are always the far aspects of the interviewee .
so anyway , this was two years ago , and this is where my book ended .
in fact , the trend is going to be the <unk> of the rest of the world .
and as a result of this operation , it &apos;s very hard to say , i &apos;m <unk> to say , i &apos;m <unk> to the true of islam . &quot;
it may be a big war between east east and west <unk> , and that it was the underlying democracy against communism .
and despite the president , for reasons , for reasons , very well , very well , not the enemy of consciousness that is not the enemy , there is nonetheless , a natural impulse to <unk> the other side of the enemy .
when the treasure treasure was in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best <unk> that the scientists had ever had had been in the peak of african penguins -- at this point as a hunting kind of .
the day after our arrival , two of us were coming in with the <unk> of two room , and the space of two is more than 4,000 oiled oiled penguins .
we have this technique in the treasure rescue once .
and this is really important because the african penguin was explained to a endangered penguin .
at the <unk> row , the <unk> row in the <unk> , front of a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police .
people are open for the <unk> .
so we launched this campaign -- very , very , called &quot; every egg . &quot;
this is not a <unk> of the second grade .
and they made these lessons in <unk> , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s going to be <unk> by the best hand , that &apos;s the <unk> . the rest are commentary . the rest are commentary .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes <unk> and put him carefully at his father , and the two men look at each other and recognize each other than divine .
so this is looking at the cells that really really really <unk> me into biology and science , and we &apos;re looking at this view of living cells in the microscope .
each of them has a tenth of a millimeter of a millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this is the picture of the <unk> .
we see all the right from the inside , believe me .
the walls are made up by 700 inches thick , solid concrete .
and the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the small <unk> in the edges .
i had to have to the car in the middle of the <unk> , for you , you know , not really easy .
yes , they have 12 monkeys for a week , and after that week , they have just used to be used as toilet .
the science is actually saying that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i <unk> a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much .
where we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not going to agree with us .
not professor and <unk> , just two spirits , ready to <unk> .
and then my life was okay .
everything i saw in the way that there was right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
if i was time to process the information ?
we spent a lot of time trying to make a $ $ $ store , and they &apos;re listening to a billion <unk> <unk> , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but still more .
there &apos;s dan etete .
we were struck by these shell , quickly had their <unk> , and the key to london <unk> was very <unk> .
it &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be the old . we &apos;re going to leave people . people leave us .
there are places where you can &apos;t go , you know , thoughts you can &apos;t think of the worlds , you can &apos;t even lie longer .
they have a <unk> and a freedom of that i think it &apos;s a foundation of a new <unk> .
she made the decision to not <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but their life is to that this one thing .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you get to me this thing on your head , and then you &apos;ll see that .
but this isn &apos;t her . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find it , his staff were <unk> , and they said , &quot; you go in the recovery , or you &apos;re going to fired and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the <unk> . let &apos;s pull out .
if it is in the box that is the <unk> , it &apos;s going to form it .
the characteristics of the word , &quot; childish are so often in the adult , we &apos;re often going to abolish this age of <unk> word , when it comes to criticize behavior , which is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
if i <unk> the ability of my sister , the 10 percent of the interest i &apos;ve been on to her last <unk> , i will be giving her ability to make more than i , more money from me until she would get it back .
it &apos;s why we live more in the dark times .
and the third is all the sound that we &apos;re creating people , the <unk> .
this is after selective <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> of <unk> , including the way that animals have taught us dancing and sing , and sing , i think , i think that &apos;s a different time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much this is , this is the <unk> , <unk> here .
so , in fact , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very nice concert .
and these are the issues that are really about heart .
one generation that makes so much more meaning from video games , as a matter of the real world .
all these are problems outside of my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of games is for our civilization .
finally ! i was .
it would be really good .
so you get quickly from the simple complex complex , if you do more . we like to do that .
and then you <unk> them , and that &apos;s a <unk> -- i thought that it &apos;s a long time until she explained to me , that &apos;s what you think about .
it &apos;s going to be in the other direction .
girl : there were a sphere and a <unk> because there are two very different <unk> , and if you drop them , they fall , they fall , they fall <unk> .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
and ultimately , we will change ourselves as the world around us as we have the world around us .
that &apos;s what incredible implications .
why do you do what you do ?
everyone would want to be the new version .
they &apos;re also concerned about it .
they &apos;re actually <unk> about that same time .
i &apos;m going back to his words again exactly in the order of the order .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m thinking that you &apos;re asking the question .
you know , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
we saw that , and i was grateful because she was just saying , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s madness . &quot;
the goal is just very simple .
this is very personalized medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a team .
i &apos;m working with the <unk> and the <unk> , which some serious problems in the project , problems that we shouldn &apos;t have to be .
in medicine , there are so many people that don &apos;t want to change , not if an <unk> engineer the answer , the answer has been the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t seen yet , and it &apos;s very fast and just .
yeah , good , your guy &apos;s got my life , because <unk> times , of all , from beautiful <unk> shape .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to make nice sketches .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth taught me a lot of about the meeting in the audience with a audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of the animals on this planet , and you &apos;ve been here until we have the second microbial era .
and the effect is the distribution of this very thin <unk> across the planet , and we had a very <unk> death of dinosaurs , death of these beautiful <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and so much .
it &apos;s the top <unk> , the t. rex , his time .
they hate us .
this is when material is coming from the deep earth and the surface is distributed to the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> from the coast away , what will happen to me ?
they have an accident . you have two options : you &apos;ll die , or you take the hydrogen sulfide and you say , 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of them are countries who are opinion that <unk> or not regulation regulation , to invest investments , affordable to nurture .
the answer is simple : the chinese are used to these factories as chemical businesses , and they don &apos;t check .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can at least my office to bring them together to develop them all together , to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the idea that it &apos;s about a new kind of new kind of , and a <unk> of the regulation of international tasks .
human rights are going to be very simple question : can i get this person to go back ?
or the boy , the beginning of the boy , the beginning of the fire , to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready to do ? go .
i was fire and the flame .
again , we saw how the word poetry walls walls were <unk> walls .
after the fight , he shook his <unk> , <unk> hair , and she said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students do their third step , but i was in the charlotte lucky to see that their journey were so developed how she did .

it &apos;s an amazing time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom line ? yellow .
if you ask them that question , you think that it &apos;s something that it &apos;s doing something that it &apos;s doing with the culture .
the countries on the right , those who give them a lot , they have a very different form of form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but it would come back to get more complex .
a online <unk> for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we &apos;re really not as good as we &apos;re really not as good .
in fact , in medical terms , this is our view of view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- can you only use to protect your eyes , using less energy .
its intensity can be very quickly , and it can be very quick off .
they &apos;re critical .
but it &apos;s just by the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> lights can communicate with the cars and so on .
dna is that , what is mean , is mean , is being mean .
it &apos;s actually not as much data .
you can be the <unk> of your genome , and the power of that is that a regenerative medicine is better than the world &apos;s currently -- it &apos;s not side side side .
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just <unk> genes -- but we could completely get it completely .
we don &apos;t run as small organisms alone around the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we poison the earth -- but it &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now , i &apos;m mainly here here because there &apos;s a kind of <unk> at the moment that we have people who think you &apos;re a dog , first of a dog , first of creating rules , first by creating rules , first by creating human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; <unk> , &quot; just to beat . and so they &apos;re going to beat them .
no , we &apos;re doing , &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- he said , &quot; -- he can try it .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you should not be .
not just to the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are just so simple .
their children are simply to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- it &apos;s working ?
wk : yeah . i still think of it , with energy .
because although i used scientific terms , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to make them sound <unk> .
and even less rare when it &apos;s being <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
the one is a white flash of light .
64 percent of 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert is a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus made the same thing over the next year over the next time .
you can teach them a little bit of a <unk> , and there &apos;s actually a little <unk> in action with other animals , but the exchange of an object on another never never happens for another .
it &apos;s the wealth ; it &apos;s deciding your own needs to save time .
we &apos;ve done that as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started to started objects like this , that was a clue that a exchange between groups existed between groups .
but who knows how to make a mouse ?
but that &apos;s me because of the connections that people are taking into , and the way that never there is a <unk> way of ideas to meet and mate , and i &apos;m sure that the technology will continue to move and therefore will be the <unk> going to improve .
this is as high as a <unk> building . i &apos;ve like the <unk> of the <unk> as compared .
we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , usually the fast development problem is the problem of how we discover things that are constantly changing the time ?
i &apos;ve been talking -- you know that situation when you &apos;re not going to get diagnosis in the clinic ?
what &apos;s the real people ?
we &apos;re <unk> part of your viruses ; it &apos;s new , but we have <unk> rhinoviruses .
after 10 another day , with a fever came back -- still -- still -- she &apos;s still a fever -- she &apos;s got <unk> -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it wasn &apos;t quite a frequent .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has seen it before .
a huge battery could do it .
let &apos;s make something that &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
i got a <unk> with low density at a <unk> with high dense <unk> , and a molten salt between .
but david is young and smart and <unk> and he wants to make a <unk> , and he built the very <unk> of the very <unk> of this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of that ?
this video was taken in the <unk> , six miles off the coast of <unk> , about 20 feet before the surface surface .
so quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to go for maria <unk> and how to care and how they were doing these <unk> and how important they found that kids and how important they were , they &apos;re not going to discover , they &apos;re going to be taught to a open .
evolution is often used as a way we chose to , but it represented it represented a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the phase of space exploration .
our cities are at risk , because many of them are standing on the coast .
there &apos;s also stars and so forth .
so if we behave about <unk> behavior or body body , as it is called the social social social , so it turns out to be language . so we think about communication .
this is , as a proud , known as a pride , by watching katrina , by watching europeans , she showed that people and from birth to blind people , that will be when they win .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re looking at these people and see how they participate . they could take them to work , and then they would be involved in more involved ?
what happens in a <unk> , what happens when you &apos;re on the <unk> level ? like the little manipulation of these tiny manipulation of <unk> ?
it &apos;s going to happen in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where can you really apply it ? that &apos;s why i was .
these things . people just show her true . they &apos;re showing themselves .
she was completely <unk> and said , &quot; i &apos;m not looking for . &quot;
they need their body , privacy and two minutes , and it can impact the other way that we &apos;re going to affect the other life .
<unk> swimming <unk> to her <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , you put an ant , you put a blade on the brain , you &apos;re going to go a blade of a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i care that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course they &apos;re now extinct in the <unk> .
but under all these ideas that are all around our technology , are many toxic ideas .
and like viruses , we should not try to destroy this .
and in my game , you know , you &apos;re <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went on international tour .
i know you &apos;re going to say &quot; t is not in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . no one &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a sort of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to go out that this shouldn &apos;t have to happen , but we need to be better when it comes to answer to the questions that you need to consider , when you follow the consequences and the reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re a driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day , just a <unk> <unk> , and she told me that they &apos;re not married , kids have kids , before these things are done .
finally , from desperation , they went and <unk> a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to keep the best talk you will ever regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connection of everything , and the unity of everything , and his matter was worth respect , kindness against strangers .
who is struggling to be while ?
they have started to go to israel and palestine , in jordan , in syria , in syria , in syria , in syria .
and so more and more <unk> , and more <unk> , and recently , they have a income to support their family .
just just simply , you know , with a different culture , from another country , with another <unk> that &apos;s kind of different and you get to it in a conversation ; you hear it .
i &apos;m going to start where the story started , in 1985 , 1985 .
now morning , before you <unk> , who had the opportunity to take a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer <unk> houses where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re doing is we follow from <unk> , things that are actually going wrong around the inside , things that are actually going to be installed .
we did that . he got caught in <unk> .
we found later that in this region , the cause of disease and death is .
one thing about the context of all we did , in the world , nelson mandela said not far from here , &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not <unk> . it &apos;s work by people . it &apos;s work by people .
i don &apos;t feel that if you call me a <unk> . really not .
it sounds really <unk> that &apos;s up from here , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s amazing .
i &apos;m going to put them to you , in believing that children couldn &apos;t rely on their community to live in a better life .
this is the recent <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> bronx .
this is a picture of the mayor of bronx who <unk> the children in his house , not in jail , they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you <unk> large children with little <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these responsibility under the <unk> , which is incredible .
now you wonder maybe about these kids .
they &apos;re kids from these shops .
stephen hawking : a teacher , the south bronx
second , i &apos;m betting that even as a <unk> is the difference , the difference is an increase in the <unk> right now , right after that sharp line .
and by 10 : <unk> , the pig &apos;s pig is a heart attack .
people with migraine headaches , which is an aura <unk> , a band of <unk> neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute at the <unk> .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> -- is an <unk> acronym -- for treating other other &apos;s <unk> &apos;s being used to treat other &apos;s <unk> .
lawyers <unk> cases on the <unk> of the hopes to <unk> in the hopes of <unk> patients who are <unk> the poor patient &apos;s full of compassion .
and a year ago , four of the <unk> in ushahidi , in ushahidi , what the way is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; also <unk> .
where do you want to know what &apos;s important about it ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i have the first time to get it here to bring it here .
these people below the <unk> , i call <unk> , because they &apos;re really excluded from the process of the process , you know , the process of the process , you know .
they have taken out of connexions as a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> <unk> that in the world in the 1930s , teaching the teaching .
yes , books , which may be 100 or 1,000 spending a year .
it &apos;s not surprising that all the way , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the <unk> are over when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or <unk> of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can make a couple of thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s like an electronic book .
everyone says that this is a $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t create it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> .
they click on things around the things and stare at the screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we all play &quot; i love lucy , &quot; i love lucy , &quot; and we can &apos;t keep up with the <unk> .
thank you .
i think most people think that a mother mother , is always their child <unk> .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s all good . you &apos;re going to live .
first , the <unk> prevent to prevent the <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the gray process at age four to 22 years , you take you to see what this graph shows . it <unk> in the early adolescence .
the idea that her father is singing in the public , was enough to <unk> .
this is the <unk> we built together .
after the first year , it was invited to be the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to install that there was online , 24 hours a day , for nearly nine years .
but at night , as we <unk> , i asked the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> decided that they were <unk> , sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place that my family has been working for four generations in the <unk> .
i &apos;m very honest : i have no idea what it has been with <unk> , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you &apos;re seeing is the terrible force of the <unk> force .
it &apos;s just like my leg , she takes me up again , and i can make me a doctor , and i can get me a doctor .
it was a depression in the floor .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about her . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years of our direct world are the end of our direct world .
it &apos;s so simple , technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect , like technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you , corn is in everything .
you should know that in any community , the number of <unk> are already going to grow up .
i &apos;ve got three <unk> in antarctica .
but she tells me where they belong and what country they belong . &quot;
we also have the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important pacific <unk> in the pacific .
and we &apos;re faced with the rest of the world &apos;s the problem .
he coined the phrase &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
and of course , the <unk> and the open seas , but the <unk> that everybody wants to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with giant <unk> and huge <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , <unk> <unk> for free of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no way there is no way that no answer to it , but if you &apos;re a geek , you say , &quot; well , what &apos;s the data ? &quot;
instead , he has very carefully documented , which is happening over again , if technology for the first time in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s it , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a gorgeous <unk> painting .
i mean , it was at least how it made me happy .
well , there was a question that i had a while in my head , you know , i can do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do this ?
and here it is on front of the front .
they &apos;re standing in a terrible situation without a road .
they &apos;re going to <unk> in hospitals .
as a <unk> , for example , i was very privileged to <unk> <unk> because i knew the <unk> -- and i know how i use <unk> , and i know quickly can work quickly , and i can quickly work quickly .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends that in her 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s and still the &apos; 90s are active than <unk> , and <unk> and physicians .
when christian <unk> was made and made of <unk> made out of <unk> , young jewish men in the u.s. and canada and canada , who would turn back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> of europe &apos;s europe .
the biggest evil , <unk> , not to make these stones <unk> , so he &apos;s trying to stop it at the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and when does the article come out ? &quot;
<unk> : there &apos;s something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 . &quot;
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of itself as extremely identified .
<unk> <unk> : islam <unk> superheroes .
let &apos;s take it .
let me highlight it .
let me show you this one .
and when i started using the design , i was discovered something weird about myself .
so you have the eye and then come the concepts .
but of course , china has also an enormous population .
but what &apos;s the case is that this kind of visualizing information is a form of visualizing information .
it &apos;s actually a delight to work with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden of the u.k. project .
why don &apos;t it be like potato or <unk> ? so there &apos;s two theories .
and one theory allows you to work less .
well , after a couple of months of , i &apos;ve discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a kind of molecule that you call it , and that &apos;s exactly the same thing .
this is the basis for the device that these two people have built by ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
now , there are a series of things in the way that i want to pay attention .
and she didn &apos;t have any idea of the context that they ended up .
norman !
i said anybody on the <unk> , neither of my mom , nor my sister , not my sister , my brother , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , no .
i call it . i have reports of it , just to say i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do . that one was my family and the other , poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us is going to go through and small bits .
he had a <unk> and has got to <unk> from others , female and probably much smaller family had been <unk> to be much smaller and they had to reach for his age of 12 .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation or is it &apos;s going to lead us to be the most of the world that &apos;s going on on planet earth ?
but will we do that , or we &apos;ll make nature of your own ?
one day , a couple of weeks , or maybe a year later , i was going to store my <unk> in a store for <unk> . i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
that meant a fundamental shift for me .
my thesis : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
if you want to know what is i &apos;m obsessed ? this project is just for me , and i still went so far on ebay a chinese newspaper from a <unk> newspaper to buy the bird with the bird with that .
when we were to the way to <unk> the <unk> , the west of sydney , was a perfect <unk> : sun , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever run again , it &apos;s just a <unk> . &quot;
i remember my father &apos;s wheelchair out on me , and i was in the top after the bottom of my father and it felt for the first time the sun on my face .
they said to me , &quot; we &apos;ll be beside them , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was enough to me the <unk> and i called the school school , i <unk> and i said that i &apos;d like to make a <unk> of her <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i work in the world .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> of the wire &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
how to hell i do a telephone in three weeks , if i &apos;ve developed these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
each of those elements could be as a kind of <unk> wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the ultimate <unk> in the british .
i look at the same time , and as you flow -- how they stretch and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s made out of aluminum footage , as opposed to the aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you think it &apos;s a while to make a contemporary architecture , it feels like me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made out of kevlar .
right after i did my dr. dr. was the lucky to be a member of a <unk> that took him for the first time to explore the sea to explore the sea .
there was one of these <unk> .
it &apos;s using red bioluminescence like a <unk> to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> light blind to the light light , and you can see it without being seen .
so they use it to eat and mate .
i challenge them to call a different science that &apos;s still used to be used for hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself to rediscover the value of the discovery .
and on june june june , i heard a loud bang on the wheel that my life was changing and the <unk> one .
and here &apos;s a <unk> .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the effects of <unk> on the lives of birds on birds .
so , if i like something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m <unk> , i can hear the music music and <unk> .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> , &quot; by martin luther king , and the other one is hitler .
now , you can see more of these things , that &apos;s the former <unk> are now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything that could be used for a <unk> . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens when teachers are willing to order to get all the time ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t stop the law . why don &apos;t trust the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom is a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here is the hardest thing and the biggest change , we need to have to the authority for the interpretation and use of the <unk> and the <unk> .
a free society needs red and green lights , and otherwise it will soon become a decent halt .
so the boundaries of the interest that can compute the <unk> , and for the taxes that they &apos;re taking .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to round a columns round with a ruler .
he had a very bad job job .
he had just a <unk> of all the time .
but the problem , and the incentives , and the incentives , is that they <unk> the <unk> activity , and they &apos;re doing that in the <unk> , the <unk> , in the two ways .
so bright <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some smart can be <unk> can be able to get <unk> on time .
why has this idea ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to push the slightly closer into the mentality that we -- and the rest of the world -- that &apos;s what they had .
this is <unk> , the turtle .
we have this one with a complete <unk> .
what i want to show you is what you need to get to the <unk> of the world &apos;s going to get to the <unk> of nuclear <unk> .
what would have been if they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the truck that you just saw , somewhere here in the <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself , itself , is a nuclear disaster .
it was sent me by someone &apos;s sent to a <unk> of the <unk> , and the fact is that it was hard .
there &apos;s a lot of black sheep out there that are doing the wrong things and the problems that have even <unk> .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them into ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous environment environment .
imagine we could , because if we could do it , we could do more .
the governments that most advances are doing most of the progress are the governments that have found out to the <unk> value , rather than the government to see the <unk> that &apos;s the case .
maybe i can look at the <unk> , and i can look at the brain , and i can change my average .
i want to kind of <unk> .
now , if you come to me , you &apos;ll come in the 19th century , which is just june june june .
we could certainly be so productive , if facebook or twitter , we would not cost much of time .
they were <unk> on the british government to get money for the building of babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines have been enormous practical impacts for society .
these funds not only allowed us to pay fewer wealthy men , but they also also <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , rather than just asking the question .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
so when you start looking at the very little stuff -- this person has written a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all the ones that are not old enough , they have no idea how this infection was happening -- namely , by these <unk> .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this is the frequency of the one every time that you can find any of the <unk> letters of the <unk> in one of random chosen to find the written .
all the way where life is , you &apos;re going to have this distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the officer asks : &quot; are you safe ? hey , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost that you &apos;ve lost ? &quot;
these are the data from one single survey to the <unk> in a single district in zambia , a few years ago i &apos;m <unk> .
as you see , bruce was a lot more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time , or it was , and i wasn &apos;t at vacation .
instead of teaching people , how to put the shapes on the cell phones , we should develop software that make it that even without practice , without practice , without practice , and without my <unk> .
this is less than i earned at that time for two weeks as a <unk> .
and then we understand that , if we want to change our trajectory , in life , or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that &apos;s what can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
i promised to myself that i would like to go around the world , no fuel , independent , independent , independent <unk> , to be sure to be safe , not being threatened by being threatened by being threatened .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane , the universities can talk to students who can talk to students with politicians to talk to the <unk> , and it &apos;s really a human adventure .
and what &apos;s the objective ?
that &apos;s why all people who believe who believe that we believe in the mindset , are welcome to this team .
now you need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to do is to create clarity , is what this problem is , and what it is not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second that &apos;s nonsense .
the fact is that we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the disease and this extreme of poverty in the eyes , you see , you see , you know , it doesn &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s all the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for us , especially for the leaders of the <unk> states that are in the way that they &apos;re in the leaders of the <unk> states that are .
people find it slowly .
and with this one campaign as a screen , my organization , data , data , and other groups of energy and the enthusiasm that came out of hollywood to the south of hollywood to the south america .
: step for step , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a housewife , and life saved .
the idea that the internet is changing , which is changing their lives , a country can change -- and a continent that &apos;s just so done , let me get to digital -- i turned to the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , your job is to recognize what this shapes is , and what &apos;s the <unk> .
now , if you &apos;re not just <unk> , then this sentence , literally , is it wrong .
if we &apos;re going to solve a problem or something new discovery , we &apos;re comparing what we already know about , what &apos;s not about us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think .
so how are you going to handle it , you personally , but do your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
so this shows quite a different image of yemen .
my heart was a half a time .
this is a list of the side side of the side side : if you eat too much salt like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , then they &apos;re probably in the <unk> .
but soon i showed up symptoms for <unk> and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i probably never seen my home again .
i sat there and i was talking about little <unk> with the <unk> for the body and asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , do it for me .
i was a dozen machines that i thought about life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> are also about 200 percent of <unk> in the u.s.
and also interesting , that the same business that &apos;s 80 million pounds sells the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , now the antidote to sell -- a and the same company .
we also started as a <unk> .
what would our young children tell us if you saw every day : i had a little <unk> , some artificial <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little bit of a sad thing .
the problem is that you , in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , these connection is not going to be able to see this .
here &apos;s where you see this <unk> at the <unk> <unk> next to the airport .
i offered five cents for every year .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that &apos;s going to look at the foot of an elephant , and the biggest part of the hidden lives are hidden .
they look like their <unk> and <unk> all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky , because they &apos;re doing something like called <unk> -- <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is just like a cathedral of stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see this .
but for the moment , all the doors of the <unk> river , open up walls , the walls break .
this was 25 years ago .
let &apos;s start for example , at first time .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- how <unk> work -- and try to find a way that the <unk> we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there a <unk> can see , <unk> / d <unk> and if you open up this image on your computer , then this program will be <unk> and <unk> .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
we need to find some way to make sure that it &apos;s going to happen , even if the computer is .
but i haven &apos;t got to do anything .
this person around with a <unk> .
why would we think what he says ? &quot;
what does his future ?
this ignores all the way completely , nobody &apos;s going to be the 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and this kind of calculation , and it would be seriously , because it would change things in two ways . but it would change things in two ways .
that means that we can recognize a copy of ourselves , if you just get a piece of <unk> , that &apos;s in slow motion , and you have a total <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came from their <unk> back and saw that their video had taken her video , suddenly , like a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to the far distance .
that &apos;s what taught him to do , after he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like the <unk> i taught you how to <unk> .
what is it that you &apos;re going to take you today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing , what does it happen ?
didn &apos;t the -- time . didn &apos;t -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in that moment , you know , <unk> or unconscious , right now , you can focus on something , you can see it &apos;s a meaning , and whatever it does is , it &apos;s making feelings .
you &apos;ve ever done what done , and i went to mit , &quot; that was me . &quot;
so to keep up to the <unk> wisdom , so god in his infinite wisdom , there was another human desire : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy through friendship , through prayer , through <unk> in nature .
and there &apos;s seven different convictions . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in the <unk> area , someone in new york , who had died when he was working on the day at the day , and this man was being a terrorist , and it &apos;s clearly said .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating a tool that &apos;s a large number of people to tell you a large number of people to tell people all around the world .
the color of the particle is the kind of feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was on the whole day . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts to walk up , and there are thousands of feelings that are collected collected .
the ten of us from the time and circle around the time .
it &apos;s called &quot; the universe : &quot; the revelation of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can actually click on this image and see this <unk> image of betty ford , like she &apos;s killing the <unk> of her husband .
you can see , you can see quotes if you want to read to you about the climate change .
so people think clouds as something that is in ways .
in the lives . it has tens of thousands of members in nearly 100 countries around the earth .
you need just one step out of out for the outside , and the reason that usually is so banal , so that &apos;s so banal , that all the other others are missing .
so look up high , admire the <unk> , and they &apos;re always thinking about the head in the clouds .
the would have 25,000 images that would have done this : &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> of my first <unk> to buy my first <unk> . it was a giant machine .
this footage from a virtual autopsy .
you can see , how the knife is in heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen that has very , very fast <unk> in its inner inner fast .
now , this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very skilled people .
i went to the kids as often as possible to make the academic material in order to bring the academic material in the real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into details why we think the universe is so that , but it makes it out of mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
and over my career , i always <unk> something in my career .
in 2001 , i went to the time of a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is the one that &apos;s been showing after the first end in 2004 .
he &apos;s just before ago , and he was a recently filmed of somebody who knows you all know .
each will have a <unk> <unk> , but at different scientific disciplines , are specialized .
i have my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really good device .
he explores the brain using mri and it says , this is the most beautiful brain that he ever had .
so the next few slides i &apos;m going to explain you to explain this .
transistors are smaller to enable that to enable that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in technology .
our <unk> is behind this lens .
i had so a gut feeling that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what &apos;s a schwarzschild radius .
i call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
so we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that &apos;s what makes us a factor of 20 .
so there were a bunch of alternative alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it pulls on a side of a much more than the other , and the cloud will be apart apart .
and i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you that , actually , that we really believe that we really have a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was looking at the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between the <unk> , cars and fire hydrant .
so for instance , the people liked the 11th of the 11th century pieces that ended up .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , about the big &quot; and what &quot; is &quot; in my own , god , you know .
through new and all sorts of instruments , the age of the <unk> of the <unk> .
but one question is , what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings of the time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new new <unk> .
until the year 1945 , it took it to 100,000 every year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m supposed to start .
wow , one volunteers , great !
but recently , my interest in this new way through a new way of view of a new observation of big <unk> , where there is something really cool .
well , i think this is the <unk> development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; confidence &quot; of &quot; confidence . &quot;
but the element of the desire is really the most important .
we get a little bit of them back .
let me introduce you to this place sam <unk> .
but even if you &apos;re the screen , you &apos;re going to <unk> a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
so how <unk> global innovation is .
first : i have to be a <unk> audience to a <unk> and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him to , instead of saying , what i &apos;m going to offer is not to offer .
and they have fun to have their own , ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , so kind of <unk> , which we call the superpower .
so this kind of tests are like this , ok ?
somebody asked me why ?
the thought he could turn the waves . couldn &apos;t it .
i think there are three big changes in which , and that in the process of transparency , choice and <unk> that people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon <unk> , says , in the world , i have more photos from her back in the world than each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and the second they did , teachers , the <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> means because they took them on specific areas where a <unk> sense is good .
so , i wish i &apos;d be a nice weekend of all a nice weekend .
dna can read and write it , it &apos;s always easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might ask , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have this whole world , this is what you &apos;ve done , that &apos;s a <unk> , who allowed to make biotechnology .
the kingdom is that his laws allow him to be <unk> , <unk> <unk> or <unk> , the economic risk or a <unk> or a risk of health or the state of health .
these laws are a <unk> in the face of science and based on prejudice and ignorance and <unk> and a <unk> of traditions and a shelter .
why are you going pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 people &apos;s most vulnerable people are injecting drugs .
so that social worker that condoms are willing to be <unk> around the gulf of endangered <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
there were children born , people died there .
it &apos;s now obsolete to personal work now .
they have the high high line of <unk> the street , the river <unk> , the river underneath the street , and you get from one end to the other without the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in a little run . &quot;
well , we should be shared .
their liver makes oil oil .
and they killed around the 12,000 sharks at the time , by just a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> bay on the island of the island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is the place of a shark , depending on the time , depending on the time , the sunset that &apos;s water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> of what the genes are passed to the genes that are being passed up from the parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to 10 , a factor of 10 times more diverse than other <unk> .
so , <unk> <unk> research and found out that the size of the 9,000 is about 9,000 .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists , if you had a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the war .
your body are going to be <unk> and they &apos;re destined to be used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell a lot of these stories .
not a business with no job .
my journalism may be in other continents or not fit in other countries , in my part of africa , but it &apos;s working in the order of corruption , asking people to immediately , &quot; where are the evidence ?
thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in downtown manhattan , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as a <unk> <unk> .
and had these guys who ever had a <unk> victim of their <unk> ?
nowadays , you can be in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of their sexuality , you &apos;re fired .
i think i think i was going to photograph my mission to photograph the gay word &quot; gays &quot; to photograph &quot; gays &quot; to photograph a million different <unk> .
at least i hope that it will be harder to get their human rights .
first : the world is , and it &apos;s always always good , and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and thirdly , i had access to every 1,000 images that had made the soldiers .
in three ways , the prevailing kind of is called <unk> .
this is a stanley <unk> , a jewish boy from the bronx bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust , right now ? &quot;
&quot; sir , who is responsible when he &apos;s going to something ? &quot;
stanley <unk> and i met both in the way that i was both in <unk> , at the james <unk> in the bronx bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the other . <unk> of self .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil through the heart of one person is .
and i did this experiment for the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do , &quot; no big thing that could jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s an enigma that really hard to be .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , is a <unk> , which is the <unk> arrow .
there &apos;s just a <unk> , which is the body .
i promise that i don &apos;t like anything to say that it &apos;s supposed to be .
and the autobiographical self has expanded memory memory , thinking of creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the <unk> -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , i &apos;m making it , and i &apos;m making it <unk> , because i think feminism has to the task part of the task , to admit , the aesthetic , and beauty and fun and fun and fun .
we don &apos;t want to be a hero .
you can now tell me , i didn &apos;t have to put on fire .
she was talking about <unk> , she founded <unk> , she <unk> , they <unk> friends -- all these everyday actions of the care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s the <unk> that homo sapiens from the previous valley of existence is different .
in fact , this is a sensor that reads the electrical activity in my brain , while i read this talk .
we made a lot of prototypes and products for life that you can control with ideas like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
the headset is wireless with an ipad or a smartphone or a smartphone .
how these children can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the physical and <unk> social <unk> and people who are being diagnosed as different , are facing the way to see .
it &apos;s understood the power of human narrative and that &apos;s worth that we &apos;re on people &apos;s changing , changing , and growing .
and i said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate your ? &quot;
my skills and my opportunity .
so , by being able , they gave them .
this <unk> didn &apos;t stop to explore my eyes .
i was walking a track i know .
and all of the time , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in my mind , not to do all the <unk> of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . i &apos;m my whole .
what we have is exactly the same thing that the same activity , but in one of them , it &apos;s great , and in the other , with just a small change in the posture , feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to take place , which is to take what level of control , which we have about our tax .
for <unk> percent of this money , you could have <unk> <unk> into the trains that would have been <unk> the duration of the journey , but what the enjoyment and the potential and the potential far more than it would have better .
i &apos;m not asking for the full of the origin of the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger is in the world &apos;s world , that the field of economics as a relational discipline is that most of the world is understood as a relational field .
if the average answer was 50 to 60 percent .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> that they don &apos;t have themselves , nor other people .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i had a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin &apos;s skin .
thank you .
so we had a <unk> , actually , very powerful effects in children around the world , and now for people every time .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful that forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> play that he &apos;s fully <unk> in your own .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , we &apos;re doing a <unk> .
there &apos;s a time at the beginning of the present self .
i have to write five pages on day writing , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you , the last time i &apos;m going to <unk> you , is something that i made with hal <unk> together , who was launched by my <unk> in a previous project , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people affected because of the face , because when one of the faces smiles smiles , you know , the other face is <unk> .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we call for western science , math and <unk> , actually in the first few centuries of our <unk> &apos;s <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no <unk> .
so this is not surprising to you , if you talk to the people who are talking about mental illness , shame and discrimination in almost every area .
a little more than 30 years ago , the united nations went in <unk> and gave this an ocean statement .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
look at this kind of profit , you can see that nearly 8,000 these dollars in real subsidies .
and that was in the early <unk> , as india was going to be <unk> <unk> -- as a means to get -- after the recovery , at his <unk> growth of 8 , nine percent , and wondering , why can &apos;t we do that ?
that &apos;s not a happy situation in any happy , but they have the confidence and the courage , and to say , &quot; we have calculated .
green carbon , so the emissions are abundant by deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon , 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things that mean , not , in fact , not -- in the way , not in the <unk> .
i also liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said he &apos;d had the same relationship with his father &apos;s exact same relationship .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they &apos;re not moving in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color that these plain plain <unk> is <unk> .
many of these ideas are breaking into the rift trailer of airstream .
if you think about it , your children can make school to send their kids to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
but let them trust them under their own conditions and trust me , they &apos;re learning to learn things that they can &apos;t learn from <unk> .
if you want to throw a device , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all this is . this is the number . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife &apos;s knee , four months after that , four months after , and in the good constitution .
how about it with a completely <unk> <unk> , not just sharing ?
this is one of the seven that <unk> that didn &apos;t have to put in all the shot .
and so it came that in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to take a thousands of , then hundreds of thousands and then finally millions of individual individual millions of each other and then , little of the <unk> that would bring one out of the hell to the hell of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as a edison scientist , the light bulb was invented , it was about this .
you have to be pretty smart , and i don &apos;t have a <unk> , doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be dumb and it can &apos;t be dumb and in the world .
they literally have the door of <unk> .
if you listen to the <unk> of your <unk> , both your ears are both in the speaker .
we have the problem that the antenna <unk> .
so thank you very much .
so , from that reason i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently i made a few <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her own special card for every person &apos;s own special card , and he wrote their name on it , she and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you <unk> .
and i think that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , my valuable and limited life on this earth is exactly the <unk> .
in this mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;m a little bit of how nature &apos;s materials .
so we think we &apos;re in the future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you see it <unk> , you see the amino acids with the <unk> where they have different charges .
and through a sequence of <unk> , you can one of a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see the <unk> coming out .
if you ask people the question : where do you go to do something important ?
i have on my desk on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have a day , you know , you know , you wake up at eight a.m. morning , or when you get up , you say , husband , i don &apos;t really have good at night .
in the office , most of these are <unk> and distractions that people actually do work from work .
we all know that that &apos;s true . you never ever experience a <unk> meeting that &apos;s an employee .
so meetings and managers are now the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once the week , <unk> , <unk> , no one week .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this for seven years , and i have no idea what the future will look like .
but if you ask people after the three important things they &apos;re carrying in themselves , no matter what culture , what gender and what context -- people say most people : the key , money , and if you own one .
but this is a very big , but we have the tendency to forget the tendency .
now , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of <unk> and then -- the owner of the store takes 10 or 20 percent of <unk> , and there &apos;s the rest of the <unk> amount of <unk> .
it challenges the norm .
and he has kind of a tribute to the values of <unk> .
at the same time , with these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell you about this later .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research , which shows how the <unk> will make a lot of life to a human level , and he says , for example , if we live healthier , we eat better food cells , exercise sports cells , and more of the ones that are actually reproduce .
i mean , i &apos;m saying to tell you who said it .
within that context , we can seem regret about many different things .
when i had home for night , after i had my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s a fifth one .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer to all &quot; <unk> can make us back for days .
and i used to say earlier , i am a <unk> .
i thought i was going to try to try to do in preparation for my ted wish to do what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to do this , what &apos;s going to do .
no in india . now , at least half a million are active there .
and i thought that anyone in this whole world in this whole world is about the organization of the <unk> .
and so we did that , we did this .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent who were treated the <unk> of their drugs or <unk> in <unk> ways .
it &apos;s an attempt to make it , and i think it &apos;s going to be successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
if the <unk> is used to be used to 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and the people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
twenty-four women from bali to <unk> food on <unk> and they used to know the secrets that only their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and see this .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords were still healthy and not poison . &quot;
then apple alex made out of the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was one reason for this : that was me .
the <unk> is not natural .
but it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not .
at the beginning , the internet was a <unk> tool . now , it &apos;s something that i am for my real life for my real life , virtual life .
&quot; it &apos;s human being true .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing test .
i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you going to do ? &quot;
we &apos;ve been treating two <unk> pages as one side , because the reader is so true .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind ?
one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time are not running out .
it &apos;s <unk> and terrible things .
all the hope lost to my recovery .
so they went to their <unk> and all raised their <unk> furniture -- they gave me a poison and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all .
you don &apos;t know how far away the road is , and you know , if they go straight straight , and you know cars and forth , and she had a terrible accident that they had done in this position .
i thought that for some reason the time , and only for some reason , and it &apos;s only been <unk> and friends .
for example , the visual structures .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we had all the symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it because i can put a little <unk> into it , right ?
if i got a magic train , and then you get a third train , it &apos;s a third .
galois has a series of rules , like these tables , these symmetries , interact with these symmetries .
we call a symmetry <unk> .
instead of all , you know , i want to know how many digits digits are , i want to know how many digits . ok ?
i need to have your name . symmetrical objects have basically -- please , i call them for me .
first , poor diet , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison had a <unk> in a software company .
penicillin was discovered in 1928 , but even in 1940 , were not commercially and valued useful amounts of it .
it was the origin of the <unk> that was the last year , the last year .
for me , the lesson from unintended consequences that <unk> is now going to happen . let &apos;s make the best thing .
it works with every computer and it &apos;s the browser , minus , minus , minus , minus and the text gets smaller .
you don &apos;t need to stop it .
and so a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by giving me my real desk .
so a means that would be something like a <unk> , so that you will get back to the more traditional desktop . these are the things that are on grid .
now i get to get the heart of my music , and there &apos;s no boundaries of more than the heart of the people and there &apos;s no way .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s a metaphor with the bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest today , we &apos;re a little bit of <unk> math -- not just <unk> , but mathematics is in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicist on wall street , and i &apos;m one of them .
you can find them here , this is a book about flies , maybe maybe on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; this is culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually interesting .
go it . shake louder ! it &apos;s louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> without traffic lights , so with <unk> , saving a lot of life , but there &apos;s an excess that &apos;s more than you .
the answer is to allow cars to come from this side of the street .
warren buffet was supposed to be : honestly , what works and what not and this is to make this annual thing .
in fact , we see the <unk> that the only familiar disease is because of the living in africa , actually humans have several several things to get the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is the economy in these areas , because it &apos;s just so much that prevents it .
but that &apos;s not just a <unk> .
not just she was weak ; they &apos;re getting weaker .

now , experts are now going to play the game and make a difference in basic anatomical .
we take this , and put it on a so-called so-called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
you look at the whole genomes and you &apos;re trying to find out the <unk> with the genes that are connected to the genes .
whether this is the individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
we know how we can eliminate poverty , we need to do more for this ?
so here are a couple more questions .
how can you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
well , it was all the same .
and it was made lots of experiments that all the same result , so i &apos;m going to just tell you about one of the things .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to change the politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small , things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re going to work .
poverty is <unk> more than scientific work and a lack of data about the effects of <unk> , the question of how you <unk> this , but <unk> esther , that &apos;s what <unk> will help you and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what damage -- and what

i think that &apos;s right here , in fact , here is the focus .
i &apos;ve got very incredible questions -- &quot; when did the beginning of the world ? how do you end up ? &quot;
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i was just totally lost the thread .
<unk> went to the local <unk> in uttar pradesh and found out that he was in the official <unk> as a dead .

rain . not bad . not bad .
individual rides can be <unk> . but why can &apos;t i do that when i learn a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> display shows the dove <unk> evelyn , why the listening of music is much more powerful than sound sound to his eardrum .
and it was so big , until the point of where a <unk> last year at <unk> &apos;s <unk> , rick <unk> , and rick <unk> and <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; millions of people on tv .
but this is not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky to be the live of live , that it &apos;s not going to be live .
peace and love mentioned .

it &apos;s 10 times more than the mammals needed to reach their maximum body size and all these habitats to conquer these habitats .
we &apos;re like , we &apos;re very similar to the dinosaurs , and we &apos;re unusual in our <unk> mindset .
basically , it &apos;s a country that &apos;s beginning to work at the beginning of our work .
this is an adult <unk> in his neck .
paul has never seen a fossil response to see .
these are all <unk> . there are a number of possibilities .
i was an artist and started to draw .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been involved with this question for centuries -- how to do these children in science .

but maybe it &apos;s different .
stop focusing on these <unk> , where you failed , if you need four hours .
at the time , it was always about to interact with things , not with people -- not with people -- not in a social way , of course , for us , and people really would help the robot to accept robots as part of our everyday life .
cookie monster is very , very angry .
the <unk> was a <unk> from our group , and they used three different technologies to interact with the people in the world to interact with the people .
and with this technology , you can &apos;t be so active in the lives of your grandchildren , in a way , how it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third one was a simple diary with a piece of paper and pen , because that &apos;s the <unk> that you normally use when you get a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is that idea of the most <unk> <unk> of the character .
i was a little , laugh , so i &apos;m really hard because it &apos;s not going to stop , but <unk> .
it &apos;s gone , it &apos;s not far . i fire , &quot; the fire , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; the <unk> , between two cars cars .
if he wrote on a <unk> , i was front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and film , but i &apos;m also doing <unk> books , books and a bit of advertising , all the same concept .
from photography , this is <unk> , she &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and you can &apos;t do it , you want to get more .
how they can do in consciousness in the collective consciousness , without that we know that , and how this happens .
it &apos;s very expensive .
and then you turn the photo that it &apos;s going to take , and it &apos;s a suddenly <unk> , and maybe less accessible .
85 percent of the global health is in cardiovascular disease -- not in the west , and yet , 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
simple . look at the same time in the island .
but if you tell them , we &apos;re trying to do the same in nigeria , all the way they &apos;re all the way .
it allows the existence of <unk> centers , and we can use the experience very smart .
we need to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
and we start a <unk> engineering engineering program , so we local people &apos;s <unk> that can fix the equipment .
so , autism has a very large bandwidth , which is very powerful -- the child &apos;s not developed -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
<unk> love i love the film , like all my projects , this is the <unk> in me .
well , what i was early in the early days , because i didn &apos;t have so much <unk> , my job , not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a kit of a <unk> .
the film is <unk> <unk> .
i made a <unk> during the training . and i made things and also how to do it , and also how to do work .
another very <unk> idea is that kids are taking some of the many of the many <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
tg : i have passion for that things that i do , the world will improve .
it &apos;s a distributed reality that can track projections and systems can be able to link systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i stand on this coast , the <unk> <unk> looks like i go out on the far horizon and belief , again , i will get the whole way to the whole way over the vast , dangerous wild one .
it was deeper , how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our <unk> that you never really like to say , how far it is , we know , how far it is .
but honestly , all these talks that i had , just just to make the <unk> , they were just different .
thank you very much fun and much fun .
and this is maybe the <unk> , he lost his sense .
he &apos;s the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium is a lot of new ideas in circulation ?
they had to synchronize quickly synchronize , which other philosophers knew , otherwise , you couldn &apos;t have the right kind of discussion of discussion .
but there was a programmer , who decided that the best way that was the work was .
each of them can do changes and you can do it by <unk> work , even if you had nothing from the existence of the other before .
this is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing here .
something <unk> that can happen to a culture is that you can acquire a new <unk> of <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , now that . right ?
don &apos;t try to do that , what others do , slightly to improve a little , because they don &apos;t do it very far .
and if you say somebody says you can &apos;t stop , you don &apos;t stop .
six to nine months at the time at the time at the time .
but we &apos;ve got these rovers in <unk> , before we &apos;re there -- or these rover -- or these rover -- and made sure that all work works .
so we have a probe on the way to mars , it &apos;s called phoenix . this probe will be in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , you can make your watches .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in the process , as we &apos;re talking about , the next rover that we &apos;re sending to mars is to send to mars .
and i know many of you have the last time i mean that these are really cool things .
there were two main projects that were particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s like the <unk> on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it &apos;s not water because it was cold in frozen .
today i want to talk today about how these exponential technologies are .
so let &apos;s see how exponential growing affects health care .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there &apos;s been wireless <unk> .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us better with our patients and spend more time to focus on the key to the important , human elements medicine that are going through through this type of technology .
the current trend in medicine is now becoming exponentially .
let &apos;s come to genomics , when we had 10 years ago , the first human <unk> was done , was the cost of a billion dollars .
thanks to websites like <unk> , i like to me , or how about your data on <unk> <unk> or google health , it &apos;s always more important to a kind of <unk> type of ways .
we used to use the cells from the bone marrow , to treat a patient with heart attacks , we found a more <unk> and higher <unk> , using a heart attack cells , cells , in a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so , your cats know how many people who are on their <unk> , their <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .

i was scared , a <unk> part of me would be out of control , and i would be caught forever , and i caught in the <unk> <unk> of her <unk> .
but i &apos;m afraid that <unk> comes from and me to show his <unk> .
if we love to love , she &apos;s holding around me all around me , i &apos;m not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that are paying attention to critical issues , images are the <unk> , images are cross images , images who are <unk> and doing something to act in other words .
in the &apos; 80s , the <unk> of the disease is an enormous obstacle to just discuss this disease , or just mention that disease .
jonathan klein : photos that the world
i had a lot of books read and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
i could see myself , as i put the flag on the front door , you know ... aah , a <unk> moment , and the music was going to be a <unk> .
finally , at the morning of the day , we got the <unk> , we got the <unk> , and we put the helicopter -- two helicopter at the <unk> -- the <unk> at me at the edge of the <unk> .
i knew that there was more open water bodies , and i had a <unk> <unk> .
i had this known , but i had something .
this was the view of my tent , when i got this <unk> call .
and just from the air , i saw the big picture .
and they turned around and they wanted to shore , and all the five died on the <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but a few days later , we thought we started to our students , and we said , &quot; what would happen if that <unk> guy didn &apos;t have in that condition ?
one day in <unk> <unk> miles off the coast of the coast of the pacific regions in one of the pacific regions of the pacific , saw 20 american <unk> in the sea ocean in the ocean .
but at a certain point , most of these , these visions are going to give up to the most of these visions .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more closely than others .
right , i read a story of an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> in the everyday life , an opportunity to glimpse into the future , if you &apos;re at time , you look .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them in every living in the arab world -- international , global , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses , and we &apos;re seeing them , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that people are taking care of people and the people who want to be informed -- they receive the <unk> through the internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as 22 to the row , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to a needle in a needle just like you share a toothbrush with a toothbrush , even with somebody else &apos;s .
so this is a completely overview of over hundreds of studies of all the high animals of the <unk> in the united states , and these are the studies that are effective , are effective , quite many of them .
so you see this stunning images from africa .
i &apos;m now , oh , great <unk> .
ines is a <unk> on the streets . she &apos;s a girl with a tail . she &apos;s a girl with a tail .

and a little banjo . here &apos;s a little <unk> .
we were at the car in <unk> , texas , the way i spent my early childhood .
and mother just sat in the car .
let &apos;s try it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
originally from the <unk> <unk> that later the <unk> built , an instrument with <unk> body and <unk> where the sound is .
well , that &apos;s easier said to say .
we were not stupid : we put in about five feet , a piece of plywood .
as a <unk> new , i came to the thought , why can &apos;t you take the oldest <unk> of the oldest <unk> , the <unk> rhythms , and they combine the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected as a community through a ethic .
it &apos;s important to the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space that was god for god .
and in a relational universe , the only thing was possible to make it that it &apos;s kind of .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and giving and take a <unk> , which is politics .
there &apos;s a different tedsters that here was two years ago , jonathan haidt , jonathan haidt , his work in three different levels of defined .
and just everything there is .
while five months he <unk> to experiment with a complete <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or <unk> reed or the chemical brothers who played all the place , they all had their own cold , da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , three weeks , four weeks .
a little bit of <unk> .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s exactly so much with the identity of living living with the memory of the dead .
but the <unk> and the <unk> plot of the richness is also the status of the deceased , and the light of the late family .
if we could extend our definition of death to optimize life to optimize life , we could experience death as part of our life and perhaps death with something else &apos;s fear .
i wanted to finish my show with a dance ...
you know about the in the water in the water , the context of the relationship between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less <unk> , and we can swim with it .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she &apos;s got a <unk> . &quot;
eight years of american history , eight minutes of my show , just so on .
and jack nicholson says , &quot; i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; do this world better place when you can .
so i &apos;m going to give you the message in advance : it &apos;s trying to be <unk> .
are the little bit ? &quot;
here &apos;s where people are going to <unk> people .
you can imagine , it &apos;s a thing , a <unk> <unk> , but if you go into a museum and says , &quot; it doesn &apos;t mind if i &apos;m going to your <unk> , right ? &quot;
and you could have my one , you know , you have a clue .
so we &apos;ve been <unk> and we &apos;ve found a lot of them and we found animals .
so we know that a little bit is a <unk> triceratops .
it &apos;s like , as if it could even be bigger .
we wanted to make an atmospheric architecture .
all the water &apos;s going to be here , so we thought that after you , after you , that after you , it &apos;s going to be the water , it &apos;s going through the water , you breathe the building .
the drill was on a <unk> .
then you go up here in this glass elevator in this glass .
and before , after .
this is a guy from salt lake city . so this is what you see .
&quot; <unk> are &quot; -- as they become seduced , a <unk> .
it &apos;s not sure that this is so <unk> if the <unk> didn &apos;t have a woman .
by the way , &quot; wired &quot; has been the heart .
now , you analyze the news , you know , if something is missing , like this people in the new york times .
this particular plant , <unk> , and some <unk> chemicals from the air .
m most of the time i have to do in the morning , when i &apos;m trying to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
and then you remember when a <unk> hit at an event on a holiday <unk> , and it was criticized for it ?
pm : are she in the <unk> of the <unk> of their foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of secretary of secretary , only 13 women in other countries was secretary of foreign .
thank you for us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that are able to reduce their <unk> by 75 percent .
for <unk> , like this is a <unk> zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;m sexually sexually aroused by this <unk> .
so to be right now , today , in your capital , you want some , in those heavy days , the treasury are going to cut and apply to the life-saving fund and the global fund .
in the contrary , it could save a lot of lives .
if we take a genome of a genome as a program , then you need to remember that chris anderson is a <unk> object , like jim watson , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in a very abstract language , you know this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is the thing you &apos;re holding for .
we heat them , add some salt to the <unk> , they heat it up to the <unk> and cooling them off , and as the <unk> <unk> , the long strand of long , and it turns out structure .
so this works really , and you can also build patterns and form shapes , right ?
you can zoom in , there &apos;s just four of the dna of the ones , and you &apos;re sitting on you &apos;re sitting on the seats that can be able to put on other tiles that if you &apos;re going to fit .
we have a very <unk> computer program where little changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something like that one square , a square one size , and it makes something much bigger .
and the thing that was calculations is <unk> , and to understand that , and it &apos;s better to get into the handle , like feynman said , we need to build something .
but as we saw it before we saw , we had three <unk> : a world-class world-class <unk> of offer to be fully <unk> and universal health <unk> and universal health for anyone with an medical age .
in modern time , where time is a very good , and the struggle is about surviving hard , is the ordinary <unk> man , and pay for the bribe to come on .
in my last 18 months , as a lawyer , in battle against small and large <unk> , the case of india &apos;s biggest <unk> <unk> , the case of india &apos;s biggest <unk> .
sm : well , the <unk> cost were less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all over four years that all around four years of looking around the world , from new york to the small new zealand here are going to be in the corner .

oddly enough , and interestingly , it looks like something that &apos;s just not done in half the ant &apos;s colony .
the nest maintenance workers take all the <unk> and put them up to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and put it there .
the <unk> , but somehow , not get out .
and we have experiments that the longer more likely to get out the longer one ant out there , the more <unk> on their surface , and so they can smell the ants that they &apos;re doing different work differently .
they &apos;re looking at all the earth , except for antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this is the cost of all over 89 million barrels , and the annual cost is three trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s what we do for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
so that &apos;s not what &apos;s done .
i think i think where we can use the natural gas .
and when i was in the <unk> of the <unk> , natural gas dollars .
why don &apos;t you do that ?
so just 500 million spiders were <unk> .
it &apos;s never been <unk> , or something like that .
tbp : i &apos;ve lost 150 million of the wind , okay ?
some people have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . you know , it &apos;s the world .
these are working in <unk> manhattan where you built the first <unk> .
these were there in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t just wait , but they had to wait , but then the <unk> , when they were there , for the third time , they had to call somebody calls .
so i &apos;m going to sometimes use a more clinical language , and it &apos;s not going to be as warm as a result of other conversation about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> good actions for people to get <unk> .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or to my family , i <unk> much less less to the golden rule . okay .
so , the results are going to raise . that &apos;s a game game .
every form of interdependence , <unk> , forces , is one , humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity .
and they tell you that , then the other people think they &apos;re not going to be respected and they &apos;re actually going to come and they hate america .
most of the diseases of poverty , but in the case of cancer , the children seemed to be the kids that died in cancer , they died mostly in the wealthy families .
a week died , a kid , but nothing changed .
because you simply don &apos;t really get this kind of energy and time it doesn &apos;t really take it .
and that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant <unk> would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cell cell and that makes you a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that the right <unk> matrix , we put the cells in the inside , and lo and behold , and then , in about four days , they were <unk> and on the right , what we &apos;ve created in a culture .
and of course we &apos;re asking us now where we go ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> journalist that was caught in the <unk> , a young <unk> whose book <unk> , whose book is so many <unk> <unk> , that you &apos;ve taken it out of the shelves ; it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new ways of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you know , you &apos;ve got four good friends of one person whose personality enemy .
that &apos;s really bad . why is they so bad ?
i can lie to lie ; they were talking to me , and then they were left .
they were told how big the chicken was , or said , the <unk> are so much , and it &apos;s like the hotel .
right there , two : right there . okay , glass , you &apos;re running a photo !
and also you want to your eyes <unk> .
but it really has my eyes , how often i get from life , for email networks and so on , although it was really nothing about the <unk> or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with these beautiful tape tape of <unk> .
and everyone who &apos;s got <unk> , i ran out .
at least for me , if i just do the same thing , i &apos;m very boring , very boring . i &apos;m very fast .
i see myself as i don &apos;t know what i see .
are you going to become nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look so sweet .
like , i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s good , it &apos;s just not that it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> too long , it becomes buttermilk .

as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty is the only factor , well , is this family &apos;s family , so this is one of the richest families saudi saudi <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition that was a political coalition of <unk> for a political goal , and that was to clean the leaders .

and that &apos;s in camp .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news news that beck was <unk> , had some climbers in the snow collapsed in the snow and died .
it &apos;s so clear to work up , that i sometimes put syringes right through the clothing , sometimes they were there .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can just <unk> how he did that .
and so he will thought back into the actions .
these are sherpas who &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
and the fourth thing that i &apos;m is is to make , &quot; ideas that we need to participate . &quot;

it was <unk> people who wanted democracy to bring democracy , because they were <unk> ideas of universal <unk> , parliament and the power and so on .
third thing is to the cities .
the second is the <unk> that we have , the way we &apos;re creating so hard to create , creating a lot of jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs are in the <unk> area .
so if you &apos;re a young country , you have a modern <unk> to try to make a modern <unk> . so you don &apos;t have the <unk> of the <unk> , you know .
you have to have a clear strategy , what &apos;s important to india and important for the world .
so the government decides to choose even .
although some people didn &apos;t want to hear it , was actually the revolution of the markets that the <unk> were used to the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
they fear the masses .
so this whole suite of mistrust between the <unk> and those who are represented .
<unk> .
each of these <unk> would have statistically <unk> for two years after the <unk> .
david cameron is lost 20 million pounds in a social social fund , to support this idea .

<unk> street , i know .
and that is where they really <unk> a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that &apos;s going on both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and the way that we can do this as fast .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , really , really just within this aesthetics .
you need a lot of the lawyers and a lot of time in court , and the <unk> decided decided that it was much too expensive .

i hope i can find these organisms , and i can make these organisms to pay attention to their remarkable <unk> , and my part to protect your life in the next future in the city .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , a <unk> still <unk> cell phones , but they also make their own <unk> , like this , which is <unk> in all the 31 in all the 31 states .

it &apos;s going to be killed so many people who don &apos;t have <unk> funeral , like this one in the world outside the <unk> of <unk> juarez .
but the other thing i hear is how you talk about fear , a certain <unk> of the risk of a certain <unk> .

because the <unk> , if she says full of the juice , she &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s green , they &apos;re feeding the world , it &apos;s enough to the sky . &quot;
but not faces ?
ok , let &apos;s take these three portraits .

europe had to be <unk> in the economic development .
the <unk> of the raw resources is <unk> in which not all , but many countries the bottom billion of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong is why there is so called &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
and so the countries that are the bottom billion is a very <unk> policy .
and a few economists came at just time , and they said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to get a auction ? it &apos;s going to reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in this moment , a billion people in poor or <unk> countries are very helpful . how can we help them ? the economist &apos; economist paul <unk> , is a brilliant plan to connect the gap between the poor and rich .
we have no containers where they &apos;re made .
here he gives a <unk> surgeons in africa that we need to do that in <unk> <unk> .
so we have this idea : imagine , imagine , you know , i thought , you know , i thought , you know , could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; basics of surgery .
14 years ago , i came across this ordinary material , <unk> , <unk> , which was used for centuries of being used in the same way .
he asked me if i could build this as a <unk> piece for the city .
so we were experimenting with little <unk> <unk> to create a dry fog that &apos;s being shaped by the wind , and it turns out that he can be shaped by people who can be shaped by people who can be shaped with people .
they were in their <unk> in the grass , the <unk> pattern of the <unk> next to people who didn &apos;t know , and they divided the <unk> of the miracle .

if peter &apos;s arm is moving , this yellow one is the yellow one of the place that you see here the <unk> , the activity in the <unk> mind .
if you do this , what will you do control ?
and to say that these changes can be able to pass beyond death , even an claim about a fact that of course , it can be wrong .
now let me just clear to clear what i &apos;m not saying , i &apos;m not saying that science is going to be , or that we have scientific answers or that we will have scientific answers to any moral question .
now , why would this be a objective moral moral ?
how high is the probability of the human development that is the top of human development ?
on the left , you see edward <unk> .
we live in a world of technology technology and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easier to break things than they &apos;re together to break together .
but then we need to talk to the well-being in a wider context .
and what &apos;s his natural enemy is what the means of the <unk> of the good is that we &apos;re talking about ?
she &apos;s a parasite , not a <unk> insect , <unk> insect , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a fast and <unk> <unk> .
and if we <unk> these good <unk> for example , they go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re at about 1,000 square miles -- this is 10,000 <unk> <unk> -- biological <unk> in <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides , 75 percent of the pesticides are doing it .
third , to the awareness of the farmers of the order of this farmer for the potential of this <unk> .

they &apos;re at the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do this balls in the soup , but it &apos;s in the soup of meat in it ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per year .
so , we decide to decide that one , or to five pounds of output .

my three minutes have not begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we need to put it on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if the system , the system , <unk> the system , it &apos;s a way that society &apos;s going to benefit in a society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back of the back , some other <unk> , <unk> , scales to make some computations . okay ?
right . so , this is the device that uses device .
there &apos;s a quality of sponges and precision that &apos;s just amazing and remarkable and remarkable .
so the first robot i &apos;m talking about is , is , strider .
it &apos;s just using a way to show that if you have cameras , or other sensors , because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter 80 , you can talk about <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel is a single axis , and the right wheel is connected to one of the same time .
welcome to <unk> , the robot mechanics of <unk> tech . &quot;
but the cool thing is the <unk> .
so let &apos;s see how he does all the first trial , and there &apos;s no way ... <unk> !
but what is the secret secret of our success ?
but just from a <unk> of the imagination to talk about it .
so this is a way of education .
<unk> <unk> : the <unk> , <unk>
there &apos;s basically no <unk> teachers , teachers , and only eight percent of the people &apos;s population have a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a whole empty empty in terms of creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to all the <unk> in the wheels , then the team won won .
over the last few decades , but a lot of money that was destined to be was completely gone .
and after all , the neighbors of what you interview about what was going to buy and buy from where and why , she &apos;s a homework .
in this , it &apos;s literally impossible to create large amounts of space .
i want to invite you to invite my journey to the <unk> and explore .
after four months , <unk> <unk> and now are coming out of eight months long .
so here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global action is going to lead to climate change , as we do fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i first learned these two things , i &apos;m <unk> that very , both of personal reasons for the scientific reasons .
it has a very good <unk> <unk> , which is part of the united states , which was <unk> by the united states .
so after treatment , we can make the child a series of simple <unk> a series of simple <unk> to see how to adapt vision .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to follow these <unk> and hopefully we &apos;ll soon get more results .
and then i have , i have to <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> of the music , and i thought , oh , i know i didn &apos;t , but before i make it , i just see how this is .
but this was the fall of 95 and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then it &apos;s aimee to the <unk> &apos; <unk> , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried to anyone who could be , who could fight , who , against what , in the meantime , are in the performing ?

and the other thing will be at ted and the designer will be 2 , two , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes <unk> .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be the actual losses of the economy , unless we use math .
or to the nurse jobs .
and another thing about mathematics : mathematics is sometimes made of the math -- like this math here -- and sometimes you don &apos;t -- how &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math , we spend about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to step three of hand .
if people ask me , is that &apos;s true ?
but the manufacturing thing in cars allow it to separate these things , so that is the driving today , and the building of a car , and learning his <unk> .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both the same at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important to computers in the test .
it was in 2009 , and i was already blind in about a year .
i was thinking about my father who had been a <unk> , because of the <unk> of a surgery .
similarly , you just can just through the handle of the <unk> that can <unk> the <unk> of the soil , and at the time , is a picture of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was <unk> , and the broadway went along , i was in every corner .
if you design a city in the mind of the blind , it &apos;s going to lots of lots of jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , &quot; i think article you &apos;re all up to me . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next , is , and <unk> you ...
you spend a <unk> money and develop emotional <unk> for the purpose of the purpose .
she &apos;s not a book that was written and the sky <unk> .
so this is how i saw that in fact , the key to me , to remember that , in the way , the car is not <unk> , and i didn &apos;t go through the stairs .
so that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to this book , some meaning , we need to really be , we need to be , and with him in the gulf with it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
and the academics thought that we thought that was a <unk> application , so we have <unk> models like this <unk> <unk> where the <unk> of a <unk> will become a <unk> on the laser &apos;s <unk> on the laser .
alex was working on a little , a little bit of a <unk> , independent <unk> called &quot; minority <unk> &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to design a computer model that &apos;s used to the film .
we &apos;re going to lead this because we yellow yellow and <unk> on the green <unk> .
let &apos;s take the apart , i &apos;m teaching it in <unk> .
we like to make the people , and we should make sure that our machines are helping us and building on building on building .
john , thank you for the science of science .
what okolloh did not have been possible for us to have a digital technology .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re going to change this .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and like all the good <unk> , you get a leap of 20 years , if the interest in the audience changes .
you &apos;ve never been available for five days . so , changes and we started to play <unk> .
india didn &apos;t want to play with the <unk> .
the other was <unk> cricket .
and the new india was going to be a different world where you could get the players from all over the place , as long as you get the best players for the best price .
we all had to see games in a <unk> , but we had never seen something yet . <unk> <unk> brought the audience with a <unk> song -- for <unk> , not for india , but for <unk> .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
i hope i &apos;ve got to get a lot of them and the game of the game , and the game of the <unk> is a long time working in this business of a time working in this business .
and you know that the <unk> dogs is because they &apos;re flashing fast in memory , how often they often have dogs and pigs on the leash .
why would anyone play in the world ?
on the other hand , if you visit a country , and for 25 dollars , and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your $ 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i give them an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is 100 to 100 or 100 , it is 100 to <unk> 100 or totally no matter of money but people don &apos;t think that .
now , in big , and all you are quite impatient .
watch what happens when we <unk> <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more more . so they say that our answer is on the terrorism , i mean , that he &apos;s a kind of mental mental mistake ?
there are no guns .
and so people are looking at economists as a stupid people .
and variation is one of these <unk> that creates a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always the variation with the subject you &apos;re in your mind .
&quot; in words , &quot; in the fashion , in a fashion , the same rule as being fantastic when too , too old or old , is the first thing to be new , nor is the last one of the old one . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not like this ? &quot;
first -- my willingness to me to be a critical audience , without suggesting i was too sure i &apos;m sure of my life .
it &apos;s my intention of the poster <unk> to <unk> , shouldn &apos;t be understood .
so , in large , we get them to survive .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell of <unk> .
if the space was <unk> , we could see that people are more resistant to the attitudes of men &apos;s attitudes .
it &apos;s like i was <unk> to talk about what i did in those 20 years in the distance .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
no food became sick .
we don &apos;t need any more trouble to get the idiot out .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these children have , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children who are so much psychological trauma or import <unk> and africa has to live with it .
through the whole book , you can pull over more than an hour of <unk> and interactive animations .
what is the business deal ?
it was at least that you always have to be very helpful , largely to be very true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , it &apos;s an idea . &quot;
they still talk about it .
when i came from college , i was working in southern california , and you <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> on the rooftops and things like that .
rsw : what &apos;s going on ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve been asked me to interviewed her <unk> and made her technical <unk> to bilbao .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m reminded of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you <unk> four months with three wishes , the ideas are always more and more and more living .
and one thing i &apos;d mention to my <unk> i wanted to mention to my <unk> was , but i &apos;ve been missed to thank all the companies that were helped me .
but in the meantime , these things are going to be a big .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the suits that the <unk> are .
the <unk> of <unk> and things are remarkable , and this is what the <unk> are going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five , and the sixth is built here .
at this level , they work around the 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer around the world are growing recycling in the recycling recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of the commercials had an image as a symbol .
and wish three is : <unk> . i told myself , i want to make myself a , and i always wanted to go to something like this .
and it &apos;s going to become increasingly more important that we can get out of these materials from these very extremely complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of working material , it doesn &apos;t work for <unk> .
traditional way , making <unk> , is it &apos;s going to be oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different types of <unk> and many different kinds of qualities .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again , to get mistakes in the same way again , again .
maybe we should study how to make the monkeys economic choices , and find out whether they make the same <unk> as we .
here &apos;s a <unk> . you &apos;ll go to a cake for you and you &apos;re waiting for you , and you get food .
you wait for a little impatient that the market is open .
now imagine that i &apos;m giving each one of you , you know , a thousand <unk> dollars in your hands -- 10 hundred dollars a hundred dollars .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- so i throw a coin . you &apos;re going to be a coin .
if we made in our little <unk> , they would do the same stuff as people who are doing the same things as people ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people in the last stage of development that makes stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about the <unk> , the most frequently stories are just four stories tall .
we need to be less and steel and we need to build more and we need to build more . recently we &apos;ve been working on <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s much as much as we could do in a year 900 cars less on the streets .
<unk> curtains <unk> my window .
maybe , &quot; citizen , &quot; because recently , &quot; because recently she stood up to fight the decline of justice , the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely in russia , largely in the local capital of the russian government , now , <unk> to the employees and citizens in the developing of innovation .
we heard about ted &apos;s about people who have been hacked by having their plants to have an arduino , and <unk> <unk> to make people and make videos and videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks always , &quot; are all the kids there ? &quot;
that &apos;s empathy .
he asked them to be a message , and all they read in their own language was a central <unk> , which is a version of the golden rule , &quot; which you don &apos;t want to do you , not you , not you , not you , not to do it . &quot;
a pastor to be means to be a pastor , to take this individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this by some <unk> .
there &apos;s over 180 messages in d.c. d.c.
it &apos;s going to run by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber .
there are also some constraints in terms of its illumination .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i saw my aunt being raped when i was five .
one of the things that i witnessed when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t eat food , and we took 400 to the 400 .
as a kid as a child , i don &apos;t forget that , i can &apos;t forget , i can &apos;t forget .
this is my story , an sharing is an artist .
my breakfast , my lunch , i was a foundation i &apos;ve been in a foundation i &apos;ve developed , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers .
audience : aye .
third chapter is a more complicated <unk> <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are in favor .
we &apos;re going to solve this problem by the best we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and even if it &apos;s happening , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa was white , whether you &apos;re <unk> , right ? is it &apos;s right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were ready for the school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense , that was the right answer , and then they asked them , &quot; believe that we all brothers brothers and sisters on earth ? &quot;
maybe your larger ability to cooperate to cooperate and adapt to ?
i think this film shows the most important glimpse of the modern times : &quot; the road . &quot;
in the world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we don &apos;t forget that it &apos;s going to be a basic contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now the good news !
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at that point the skeptics is the skeptics and the <unk> of climate change in the face .
so we &apos;ve done a couple of years ago , a project for the <unk> did , a big program , it was meant : the <unk> -- with lots of people -- a lot of experts -- a <unk> <unk> .
one group of them would be to spend it for yourself to spend yourself and other people &apos;s supposed to spend it for other people .
when they went from the first building to the second , all the time went on a man who were <unk> himself and &apos; <unk> help . the question is , they thought they helped and help ?
the word &quot; <unk> &quot; , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; unclear &#93; stuff : the hidden life of <unk> things .
and since -- it &apos;s been four decades ago -- i &apos;ve been working with the best in this area , in the world , as young and old , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a rich web of art , and successes and accolades .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my passion life , my real life life .
i was dancing between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to the way that i adapt to my <unk> .
well , it was very frustration .
that &apos;s how it was .
he put them together into something <unk> , and then he made them into this software that i think she had developed his son , and he has this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little <unk> , little <unk> .
i want to say , to say , you &apos;re creating a beautiful website . how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make a nice website ?
now , they &apos;re asking the linked data that they put in , 32 hits , each of which every one is a protein with these properties and you can see them .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s about linked data .
all this will lead to every year that every year two million children are less likely to die less than a year 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to get <unk> feedback and to collect feedback , to make sure that the claims are really results results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that number ?
my brothers started to draw me tips for drawing and draw .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m fascinated with this area .
how many of you have a cow about the street , in bangalore , to mysore , from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just so that we &apos;re training as people who are trained to reality , and that &apos;s what makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; all right .
can you not do something like anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from <unk> .
because if we see somebody , we see the footprint .
what percentage of these have made foreign <unk> ?
obviously , he has the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually beautifully suited to the end here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve found that most things are very <unk> about economists , assumption assumption , most things are very <unk> .
this is the place that i showed you in the beginning .
we &apos;re going to have a little bit of technical .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t keep it on it , so you accept it and find them a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to be .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza is a little pizza when you have hunger .
there &apos;s millions of different <unk> .
so remember , if we think about sexual education , and activity are going to be in baseball .
it &apos;s the poet <unk> chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s how much percent of the day is you think of that person ? &quot;
in fact , people have <unk> <unk> of these people &apos;s <unk> .
they came to <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it became really a powerful force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think that men are <unk> as women ? &quot;
there &apos;s no time on that planet was the women so educated , so interesting , so that &apos;s how interesting .
she &apos;s 23 them for 23 .
i started to <unk> , why you &apos;re more likely to fall into the one person in love than in the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race , as long as the human race is on what shakespeare is called &quot; this <unk> . &quot;
but unfortunately i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves , whether it could be that the resistance of the cause of death and disease disease -- at least most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much more <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our views would be wrong with diabetes ?
my great , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of the ford motor company company , life of the people &apos;s mission to improve improving and cars for every affordable affordable .
and the good news is that we &apos;re now the big issues of cars and environment , not just at ford , but in total ways .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support this <unk> future .
this is a minute of a minute .
i think now , my mother , i think , is this kind of <unk> .
the nurse is to put data in .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what &apos;s going to come out ?
well , it was great because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when a student of a <unk> , i met adults who were really interested in my ideas , and i was <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> with me .
now it &apos;s just about the children . so we don &apos;t <unk> .
so basically we gave the children a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money that you give us , is it used to buy aids .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is is that <unk> is cool .
in a way , in a way , in elegant , or a <unk> device , which we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of <unk> experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the <unk> of the country in the cities that has taken 200 years to the same process in 20 years .
it was seen changes , although these were not supposed to be practical .
so we would have the models of the kind of <unk> sky .
i think one reduction in altitude from 94 percent in almost <unk> .
and how do we do in this sort of growing world , in particular , in some places , i &apos;m talking specifically -- china , for example , that &apos;s going to be 400 new years of airports .
and this is the focus of the <unk> talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in positive senses , which is healthy and our well-being , without proper darkness .
unlike the first office i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is an absolutely <unk> office in which the <unk> is .
and you see the <unk> building that later became a icon of modern <unk> .
i find that what you &apos;re seeing here is quite puzzling -- how much light in the sky has evaporated and never the floor .
it &apos;s not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
if our <unk> <unk> , like a few weeks earlier , a war in a third of india is called <unk> , about 200 <unk> , he &apos;s called the topic that the topic is wrong .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was home , i saw a <unk> , or i would get a <unk> , or i would like to be like a <unk> , i could be like a <unk> , would be wonderful .
ag : but what is it going to be used ? what &apos;s used to use it ?
to do what ? to break stones , to dig rocks .
this is the only place where they could express their creativity .
they want to have no second choice of standards and <unk> .
and that &apos;s what sheikh <unk> did made <unk> .
i had to my loved .
mr. <unk> , who lives with a physical challenge , is just a 50 inches big .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> billion people .
or skiing . it &apos;s just fun and people love to love it and fun things .
so we worked very , very hard , but we knew it &apos;s so hard to develop the technology , like the acceptance of what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not designed to park next to the end ; it &apos;s wonderful <unk> to you to drive them between cities and forth , but think of that , we have all the problems with relation to the range and speed .
so if we could have this box here , we could have a couple of years for transportation , electricity , and communication and <unk> freshwater in a sustainable package , which is 60 pounds of a sustainable package , which is 60 pounds of diameter ?
and forgive me or explicitly , people who are dying , somehow in the drug that are involved in the drug that are involved in the drug or professional professional <unk> or even both .
los zetas is when you &apos;re a <unk> of psychopaths , fear and <unk> in cities , and the press press and the press , and it &apos;s also true for most of the time .
mexico and the u.s. , now , is now in a real international organization , the partnerships with the production in production and global employment in the world distribution is distribution .
but also part of it , a month of being a month of being a month -- you live in the future , and we have a long <unk> .
and after it falls under a critical price , it tends to be successful , and if you &apos;re successful , you &apos;re about a critical mass of <unk> , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re very , very cheap , and you can see the interesting thing . if you &apos;re cheap , the brands you lose , the <unk> and so , <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , you &apos;ll win .
if you look at linux , linux is in red , it &apos;s got 20 percent .
&quot; open up to &quot; you know , the gift of the silicon valley of the world .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works between and try to take the best out of the two .
to the second , it was very cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world access to a technology that it has enabled to him to change his life .
and these are the characteristics of the men and women , through all of the generations , all of the generations .
you remember , while the <unk> <unk> in his blog , over the <unk> and <unk> it often , that was just because it &apos;s just easy to use .
i love music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin play and i said , i can do that .
i wrote this post , and i &apos;ve been writing about einstein today .
and you see this .
these little things .
and maybe i have to <unk> , because i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it was a tremendous <unk> , except for our generation .
we need to use this technique to use a better understanding of how the oceans are going to get the oceans .
we studied these fish in the way , but we had to learn to how we have to keep them .
but it &apos;s just half the biggest tuna that we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . it could be sex under the ground . and there &apos;s it .
you can -- you can -- it &apos;s a seal -- it &apos;s a seal <unk> like a seal -- and a white shark will go on it , a <unk> creature .
and then we give us these animals even one encore , by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t know that the records of my <unk> were so right .
they said , &quot; apart from the one we &apos;ve talked about , they &apos;re not going to be groups of that u.s. damage ? &quot;
you need to waste your energy .
who &apos;s now looking at my <unk> , and i know that i was there , and i know that i &apos;d like to be a ninth of <unk> for a <unk> in the <unk> .
all the moments i &apos;m putting a <unk> on my life .
when i started to the project , people have said , &quot; why would you want to tell everybody what you do and where you &apos;re ?
now it &apos;s quite normal .
now , you see , please look at these <unk> of paris , to see how incredibly fast growth is .
i looked at thousands of these <unk> , and trust and efficiency and efficiency are the time .
how <unk> we went to face how trust face is built by face ?
i was a mind in the system .
this page comes up with a day , and 80 percent of them get a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality i showed you that i &apos;m going to come back to again .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second <unk> <unk> , with the 50 american states -- the same question : the more unequal countries are all at all of this scales ?
with a devastating effects , what the benefits of the human talent is .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find the same as opposed .
the social judgment take a lot of judgment , and fear of these people .
or for instance , for instance , why violence is in more unequal societies , is because people are squeamish sensitive to become <unk> .
a year , more than three million <unk> a year , a new knee or a <unk> .
you remember , as kamal before you were before the <unk> .
if you wear it under your pants or you wear a <unk> , it &apos;s very clear that she &apos;s a prosthetic , and in societies , in which disability is very sensitive , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want to make a dirty magazine ?
i actually have the <unk> <unk> bought bought . there &apos;s a little piece of paper on this , it stands , &quot; don &apos;t use this <unk> to <unk> juice .
so this is the result of one to 20 , &quot; google just so many , &quot; o , so many , &quot; o , &quot; there are pages .
strong fear is <unk> .
but if you always would be in that condition , it would never be done , because you would like to say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to make it . &quot;
almost all we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about to be safe in this world .
if the calving process was , it would be apart , then apart , they would never be a ride .
it &apos;s a very small piece -- you should have the results of the results .
so i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that would look at me like an alternative education .
and the evening that &apos;s 70 70 children &apos;s got on the internet .
so i could even choose to choose a cross-section of a cross-section of a <unk> , which is part of the world .
what you see is obviously a child is operating the computer .
natural systems are all <unk> : galaxies , molecules , cells , cells , organisms , societies , except about the theory of the intelligent designers .
and it &apos;s about <unk> of all over the <unk> .
i bought a nice suit and i was wearing a nice suit and i got the remarkable access to the <unk> that i had to <unk> .
but in 2002 , when my tour went to the end , i decided i didn &apos;t want to go back to me in london .
i felt that was destroyed something .
and i went through . i went through these numbers .
and i was traveling in kosovo and <unk> the government .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that is obviously , who is obviously , obviously , and there is a result of the world &apos;s fragmented .
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re affected these people who are actually affected , not <unk> .
this is the 21st-century politics . and in a certain sense , independent diplomat will be these <unk> , these changes that we all have .
&quot; hey , could you get me to get me ? &quot;
because if we go to the <unk> , they understand that they can tell through these practice that make an easier mistake , you can tell , or remember , why you love something .
we feel awe , mercy .
go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , the <unk> show &quot; the <unk> , &quot; the 1973 of <unk> in the top 10 , followed by &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; three angels for charlie &quot; .
i can choose it from the island .
and i &apos;m looking forward to talk about it with you , i &apos;m going to go in and say , &quot; can somebody tell me the question of the brain , and why it &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
next is making this <unk> stuff that the <unk> <unk> .
for a series of reasons .
or even worse , more <unk> education is always the same as the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have so much work in front of us and when there is a person in science , i &apos;m going to ask you to join me .
we climb the stairs and we experience a state of consciousness .
so many books say the same thing , which is that nothing is so much together they &apos;re so much going to be so much .
durkheim believed that everything was going to be a <unk> of success .
he said that &quot; <unk> and <unk> people don &apos;t get together and without <unk> <unk> , nothing can move to it . &quot;
it &apos;s taking the other .
once they were all in a different tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation for themselves .
it &apos;s about to connect with others , and we &apos;re about ethical ideas .
jh : thank you .
i realized quickly that don &apos;t just be in the world .
and right next to the garage , he has his own <unk> , where he can degrade his own <unk> , which is another important role in <unk> play .
all of it &apos;s always become simpler in design , and here &apos;s this <unk> , and , my god , i just photographed it .
&quot; the end of the <unk> is going to printed this for the fifth time .
