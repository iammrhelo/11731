you know , one of the big <unk> in the way , in the travels and one of the joys of research is research , with the people who can remember the old days , which is still in the wind , and the rain sheets of the plants can taste the plant .
just knowing that still <unk> beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myth of the world &apos;s oldest still fully meaning , or that in the himalayas , the &apos; breath are still the breath of the world that we live in an absolute meaning , but only a model of reality , as a consequence .
and of course we share all the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we &apos;re going through <unk> .
we need to be able to look at the <unk> of death through death , and so we shouldn &apos;t be surprised that we all sing and dancing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> of the forests in the woods , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , or even a <unk> on the <unk> of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to be guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , just with hope .
together , the <unk> cultures form a web of <unk> and <unk> life , which is as important as the biological <unk> and it &apos;s probably important to the earth as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of all thoughts , and dreams , myths ideas and the <unk> , <unk> of the human imagination has been defined by consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humankind .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we are as is an amazing species .
and equally as the biosphere has been so <unk> , it &apos;s happened with the <unk> -- just with higher speed .
no biologist would argue for instance , that 50 percent or more of all species are short in front of extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of the biological diversity -- hardly that , what &apos;s happening to us as a <unk> .
and the key for this is the extinction of languages .
and as any of you in this room were born , on the world , on the planet , 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the kind of <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture is access to the physical world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual opportunities .
and from these 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re in monterey , in monterey , that &apos;s where we &apos;re in monterey , which is not a half .
they &apos;re not taught to be more taught . that means if nothing is done , you know .
what could be more lonely than being <unk> to be <unk> to one of the last of the people who are talking about , one of the last of the people to be no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of children ?
and yet , the terrible thing is actually somebody somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because of all two weeks , she died an elderly man and take the last two weeks , a older language begins with himself .
and i know that some of you are saying , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world &apos;s a better place , if we all talk about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language . &quot;
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would see how it would be if you could not talk to your own language .
so i want you to a kind of trip today to a trip through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> to try to make them understand what has lost lost .
now , there are some of us in that kind of thing that i &apos;m like , if i say , &quot; different ways of existence , &quot; really different ways of my father .
take this child , for example in the northwest , in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east , from <unk> snakes .
this is a <unk> people , which is not a <unk> between colors blue and green , because the <unk> is the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language called a <unk> called a linguistic <unk> : you have to marry somebody who &apos;s a different language .
now , all this <unk> in the <unk> past . the strange thing about this big houses , which is about six or seven languages , but that you never hear somebody who is language .
you just hear and start to talk .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever been in , the <unk> <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the next year was 1958 .
in 1957 , five <unk> touch contact with five <unk> and made a <unk> .
they took pictures of the air from the air , what we consider as a friendly gesture , forgetting that these people from the rainforest in their life had never seen something <unk> .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , and they didn &apos;t find anything and <unk> that would kill five <unk> with the <unk> .
but the <unk> wouldn &apos;t kill us for the <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths went through <unk> .
we followed the eight generations eight generations back and found two of a natural death of death and when we had the people who were so old , they gave that one of the people so old that he died and we killed him .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
they could smell the urine of an animal from the urine of the animal , and what determines the animal species of this one .
in the early 1930s , i got an amazing assignment when my professor was at harvard , i asked if i was interested in haiti and the secret societies that were used to go to haiti and the secret societies that were using the foundation of <unk> and <unk> .
in order to give you a sense of a sense , i had to know something about this remarkable faith of knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i was going to ask you , the great race of what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , whatever .
a continent is always going out , because the idea was that there are no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was a and <unk> of this very profound religious thought that during tragic diaspora &apos;s <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting about this is that living relationship between the living world between the living and the dead .
the living will give the ghosts .
ghosts can be <unk> by the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance , the <unk> of the living in the world to fall in , so that the <unk> for a very short <unk> moment .
<unk> people say the <unk> love , &quot; you know white is in the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taking away from the mind , how do you do damage ?
you can see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> coal , an amazing component of the ability to influence the body so that it &apos;s <unk> in a state of extreme arousal .
well , of all people who i met was the <unk> from the sierra sierra <unk> de <unk> <unk> , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the ancient <unk> civilization , which is the western <unk> of colombia , and in the aftermath of the conquest , that people moved into a <unk> <unk> giant giant <unk> giant back above the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people have the only ones that had never been eaten by the <unk> .
until the day day , it will become a ritual priesthood , but a ritual priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are at the age of three and four years from their family , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> on the edge of the glacier for 18 years of darkness in <unk> <unk> on the edge of the glacier for 18 years .
and while all of this time , they become culturally culturally the values of their society , values that make the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing <unk> , she &apos;s going to take one day , and for the first time in her life , at the age of 18 , at age of 18 years , you &apos;ll see a stroke , and in the age of 18 years , you &apos;ll see a <unk> . and the priest comes back to the end of the first beautiful beautiful landscape .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about a native and we think <unk> , we &apos;re either <unk> and the old <unk> of the <unk> , which is a <unk> thought of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> thought , or the other people are connected to nature .
so , they &apos;re not <unk> , nor are the <unk> , nor are <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of place in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or cold <unk> of tibet , but they still have , through the time and ritual , and ritual has been shaped by time and ritual , the idea that the earth can only exist .
well , what does this mean ?
it means that a little kid out of the <unk> that is a belief in which the mountain is a <unk> , who is a <unk> , or your destiny will determine a very different person , and another relationship , as a little kid in montana , which is <unk> .
if it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which is the relationship between the individual and nature of nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> in the forests and believed that these forests are being there .
and that made me another person as my friends under the <unk> who believe that these forests are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> ghosts and the <unk> ghosts are involved in the <unk> world of the world .
well , if you start to look at the idea of the idea that these cultures can create different ideas , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph that i &apos;ve been doing since last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard , the most powerful <unk> are <unk> from the repertoire of <unk> .
so what &apos;s so fascinating is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> potential , but its processing . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , and on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden <unk> that &apos;s a series of <unk> smoke on her consciousness , and it &apos;s about as if a <unk> <unk> smoke from the family &apos;s family .
this plant contains some very powerful <unk> of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , you &apos;ve seen this stuff like this stuff , these substance that they &apos;re creating in different ways of creating <unk> .
this powder is about how to shoot like a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s going to be no distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i was even with my professor , richard evan , who was the man who &apos;s <unk> with the discovery of the magical mushroom in mexico in the 1930s , and i argued that you couldn &apos;t use this <unk> as a <unk> device , because in the moment you feel the implications .
but the thing is that they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to get <unk> , because they &apos;re through a human gut , of course , <unk> , <unk> .
you can only get that in conjunction with some other chemicals , which is the <unk> <unk> .
now , the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are used in the <unk> , <unk> of the way that is necessary to <unk> , so you ask yourself .
how can we find these people from <unk> species of 80,000 species plants don &apos;t find these two pools of plants that are starting to find a kind of <unk> version , so that &apos;s all greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which is something that &apos;s meaningless .
but , you know , the indians say they &apos;re talking to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 variations on <unk> that they &apos;re all at great distance in the forest that they recognize for our eyes .
and then you ask them , as they say their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you do some of the plants .
i mean , you know nothing at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out , you know , that every one of the 17 contacts are in <unk> and they sing them into a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
well , the problem is that the problem is that even those of us who have native sympathy for the very difficult location , they have to look at them as <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of going into the past , which is the real world .
so , in the fact that you don &apos;t see the twentieth century , in 300 years not to remember his wars or technical innovation , but rather than being an era we were in , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either have been actively supported or passively .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with a new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> stopped hearing less on the sioux , when they took an arch and the arrow of the time to be americans , when they stopped horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> , and it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and also , wherever you are in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the doom , these are dynamic living peoples whose existence is the existence of <unk> forces that existence by <unk> forces the existence of a generation in the forest , and now it seems to be <unk> and prostitution .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of the political <unk> .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people , is convicted of the people , but the <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle , not just <unk> , but generally , and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering doesn &apos;t understand if you haven &apos;t seen it .
i went around with a fellow colleague 6,000 miles from <unk> <unk> through <unk> <unk> by <unk> after homicide , and i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you hear , 6,000 holy people who were killed in rubble of <unk> .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as the followers of <unk> .
that meant that he was <unk> during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled with her holiness the diaspora to come to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned for punishment -- for punishment -- for the crime .
he was in the age of two years in the prison age to hide yourself under her <unk> , because she could not live it .
the nurse , the nurse was <unk> , became a <unk> .
one day she came out of a <unk> <unk> , and for these <unk> , she had to build them for seven years in a heavy labor .
the suffering <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people &apos;s mind is something <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really about a choice , and we want to be in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> : the big anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that we , as we , in a thread , <unk> , <unk> in the world , we &apos;re moving to a dream of the human imagination on a <unk> way to see that there were no other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species might exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that gave us agriculture , and we &apos;re at this point of cult of the <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> through the slideshow of <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus created -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world is how we know it &apos;s almost 300 years old .
well , the shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we face in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these <unk> <unk> to the importance of human beings , answers to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be the possibility of the possibility of what we &apos;re talking about , people with the importance of the importance of all people and creating a space , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the northern end of the <unk> column when i went to <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and this man , <unk> , telling me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> years of the world , in the world of <unk> , they were forced to move to settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family who was scared about his life , he took all the guns and all the tools .
now you need to know that there &apos;s no fear of the cold , they used to be scared of the cold , they used to her .
the <unk> of their <unk> were actually originally made out of fish that were created in <unk> .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t know about the arctic night or the white storm .
he <unk> out , took his pants out of <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and when the feces started cold , he formed it in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> the sides of the <unk> and when it was completely cold , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , she took a skeleton of his dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> another dog and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> .
you can &apos;t do anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the proton and all of the native world .
the canadian government was there in 1999 in 1999 , in 1999 , in 1999 , that &apos;s bigger control over california , which is larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , as a nation , a state , the <unk> with its people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent the parts of the human imagination that has been <unk> in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , how the dreams of our own children are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do in national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> <unk> is not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world and so we are probably the best institution for storytelling in the world .
reuters nations send to our <unk> .
we &apos;ve read our magazines from millions .
and we do a series of trips to the <unk> that we have to take in places of such cultural wonder that they get from this stuff , and hopefully , they will be one of the other the greatest revelation of anthropology : that this world has made it deserves to create a <unk> in a really multicultural world .
thank you .
so what i first can show you as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we microsoft is , as part of a woman in which it can either be local or large amounts of visual data .
we see many , many of the <unk> pictures of the digital photographs here that you can , and continuously , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these are collections or how big .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this is an example of a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in one area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing is the power of a system like this , the number of a system like that , is the number of panels on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can actually do something like that , you can really show that this is a real representation of <unk> and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience to read a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium at a scale .
we also have something that special edition of the guardian did .
we have a <unk> display with very high resolution , which is much more higher than in a normal display , and we have added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical intervention .
and this is really the ideas that really make these ideas on the existing space on the screen .
we hope that this is not going to be <unk> and other rubbish , that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping of the really <unk> uses a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be doing this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
<unk> on the <unk> picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something else .
now this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies .
one is <unk> and the other one is a very good research about <unk> , the <unk> of noah , a <unk> university of washington , under the advice of steve <unk> on the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick was done by microsoft research , a very good collaboration .
so this is a live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
and you can see that if we create these kinds of views that we can , through images , and this experience of <unk> &apos;s resolution .
but the spatial structure is the pictures that is in fact .
they took these pictures together to make them the real space , in which these shots that were all around near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> in the canadian <unk> in the canadian <unk> , and you &apos;re looking at these things they &apos;ve got elements in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are things that are much <unk> .
i would like to show you a <unk> <unk> of noah to show , and this is from a early prototype that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you that really , what i think is that it really is , if you look at the environments we think it &apos;s really not necessarily the punchline that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral notre dame , who &apos;s just in the computer with pictures of flickr , just just a <unk> lady in flickr and you &apos;ll just get pictures of the men in t-shirts and on and on the <unk> . each of this orange was discovered .
so this is all <unk> , and they &apos;re all in the same way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i didn &apos;t believe that i &apos;m going to work to microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception .
and i guess you can see that these many different types of cameras are : everything is that these many different types of cameras are , a pretty large number of you , all of them in this environment .
and if i can find some of the weird ones .
many of them are covered by faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which is really recorded .
we can see from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
so the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and you &apos;re going to collected data from all -- from the entire collective memory of how , visual memory looks -- and everything is going to be connected .
all these pictures are connected to each other , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes from all the earth .
consider this as the sequel of work by stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that is through the complexity that people use it , grows and use its use for the users of it .
their own photos will be thrown out with the inhabitants that another person has created .
if someone has done it , and all these sacred and all these sacred and you tell them who they &apos;re all , then my photograph of the <unk> <unk> of all of all this data , and i can use them as a starting to dive into this room , and i can use it as a start to dive into this room , in these <unk> , the pictures of the other people .
and of course , <unk> all of these are the tremendous virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through <unk> or images and so on .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? it allows you to get your software to a certain point , within the next years , all the images that are being used by in the world will be used to compete with each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter anything else .
if you want to make them <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting , if you think about the amount of <unk> information , which is the many of these pictures .
if you can do a <unk> for pictures where you could do sentences in the text and the text of the website , a lot of information that &apos;s picture .
but what would it be like if the picture with all your images ?
then the scale of the <unk> is <unk> and the amount of abundance that it makes it , it &apos;s enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book to tell you how i &apos;m hoping to be in love with other things that you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections if you didn &apos;t have that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies are societies .
it &apos;s going to be like this : if our goal is to maximize the common thing of our citizens , is this particularly through the <unk> of the freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , is valuable , positive , for the human condition for the human .
if people have freedom , then everyone of us have to do for themselves to do things that we need to maximize our own selves and nobody .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices have people , the more freedom of people , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common .
this is , i think so deep in our water supply , that there &apos;s no no sense of question .
and it &apos;s too deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you a couple examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to briefly say something about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t pay for 10 and 12 <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that they could buy a large number of <unk> in the store , in the unlikely case that none of the store is right in the store .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> store for a stereo -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> . and in this one electronics , there are so many <unk> facilities .
so we can be <unk> millions of different <unk> facilities , put out of the components that will be an business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have the phone on the phone , you could have <unk> on the phone .
they fired her phone . they &apos;re not bought .
one episode that the phone was never broken .
those days are over .
we have an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and you should not have seen that until you &apos;ve seen in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to walk in the business and ask them to ask this question .
now you know what the answer is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , not too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more <unk> than that , of objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
so instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor , you could tell you , we could make a job .
one has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and take risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a lot of these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and take risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doc , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift in the reality of responsibility for making decisions of the responsibility of someone who knows nothing and probably ill , and not in the best thing .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for <unk> drugs like it and me , if you think it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you &apos;ll expect the doctor to ask the next morning and to request a change .
something that &apos;s how our identity is now a matter of choice , like this slide .
we have no identity ; we invent them .
and we make ourselves as much as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up at the morning , you need to decide what to be a kind of person .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the <unk> was that almost every one had had one , and they were able to <unk> them as quickly as they could , and then they were able to do so quickly .
the only true choice was , &quot; not when , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy doing other things , they ask themselves , &quot; i want to marry , or not ? i &apos;m going to get married ?
do i want to marry later ? should i have children , or do a career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , if that means all of the tasks that i don &apos;t want to leave you and don &apos;t make good grade in my course .
and in fact , they should do this . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we &apos;ve been blessed to work out of the technology that makes us every minute of every day of every day on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s actually a <unk> , by the way i &apos;m going to tell you that the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is , this incredible freedom of choice we have in relation to work again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids in football , and we have our mobile phone at the end of the hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop would probably be on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute in which we <unk> our child at the <unk> of a <unk> , we ask ourselves to this call ?
i &apos;m going to answer this email answers ? i should write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it surely your experience of your child &apos;s experience very different than it was .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material , material things and lifestyle , is a matter of choice .
and the world in which we had looked like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was the choice .
and the world in which we now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
an effect , a <unk> way , is that it &apos;s going to happen .
so many options that you can choose , is it very hard people to decide .
so i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example , a study of investment in volunteers .
one of them had access to the <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she was found was a 10 <unk> <unk> who took <unk> , took the participation of two percent .
they provide 50 percent more <unk> -- 10 percent less collaborators than if you &apos;re only going to offer it . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 to the choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide that it &apos;s hard to decide that it would spend it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , never .
you know , it &apos;s not just to say people to eat food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to you , it means that they &apos;re going to make large problems that they miss great <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be done by giving them up to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the <unk> who were happy to breed .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world that looks like this .
they want to really meet the decision , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or something that &apos;s wrong .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the narrative and make a decision , we end less with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to choose less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is made by the big choices of different <unk> when they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s happening is that they had a different decision that would be better .
the more ways there are easier to regret is not to regret at all the choices that they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has a big point in this morning , and he told how much the kind of thing we evaluate about it depends on what we compare .
well , if there is lots of alternatives to remember , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive traits that you agree with , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have .
here &apos;s a couple of <unk> .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . it &apos;s great . it &apos;s all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn man &quot; man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my neighborhood neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility of day day , day , a great parking lot .
<unk> <unk> lower happiness that we get through our choices , even if we have fantastic .
and the more choices there are more attractive to the choices , the more attractive properties of these kinds of choice .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon does some of the statements .
he makes an assertion about it now and maybe things slowly do slowly .
but a very important point that he &apos;s power is : always who you decide for one thing you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like many , many attractive traits , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this has been struck me when i wanted my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a kind of time in which there was a way , and they bought them , and they have bought them , and they didn &apos;t have <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if they carried them long enough , they have enough , &quot; ok , <unk> .
so i went to buy new jeans after many years of the <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to be a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , slightly <unk> or a half ?
do you want to buy the buttons or <unk> ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
if you want to be a <unk> , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down , and after me , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way i was . &quot;
he had no idea what was that , so i spent an hour of all these bloody <unk> , and <unk> the business -- and i &apos;m saying the truth -- the best one i had ever had .
i had better . all that made me better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain to myself .
so the reason that i was feeling was bad for me with all of these options , my expectations of what a good pair of jeans went up to a good pair .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have any concrete expectations than it was just in a way .
when you come in 100 species , damn one of them should be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i expected to do , and what i expected to was was disappointing to what i expected .
the other thing that is , in the lives of the human lives , people are inevitably the expectations of how well that will be good .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even if the results are good .
no one in the world &apos;s <unk> knows this . because if you &apos;d like it , you know , you know , you know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that all better than anything was worse than everything was worse than anything that was worse , it was to make it possible for people possible .
now , in the world where we live -- we &apos;re wealthy , educated citizens , with perfection , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you can ever hope is things as well as you might .
they &apos;re never going to pleasant because their expectations are , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all came -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have it better . i haven &apos;t <unk> myself .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad day , jeans , if there &apos;s just a way to buy a way that when you &apos;re impatient , you know , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what should you do ?
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy a <unk> , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is , you know .
they could do it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people meet decisions , and even when the results are good good when the results are good , they feel disappointed .
clinical depression is <unk> in the world in the last generation .
i don &apos;t think a <unk> -- not the only thing , but a <unk> <unk> is the explosion of depression , and also , if you have these experiences , they have learned the standards , and then their standards , if you need to explain these experiences .
and so the <unk> thing that happens is that it &apos;s going to happen to us better , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is the <unk> <unk> , which is one that we think is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is something better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this very long time that we missed our public .
now , as an <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as an important question , the thing about the thinking is about , what all of these kinds of choices are in the developed societies , that &apos;s wealth wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of you , whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that they too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and it is : steve <unk> has told you yesterday how this expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they actually hurts .
they worry that we &apos;re bad at there .
if something of what the people of our society would allow us to meet these societies into a little choice , not only life that &apos;s life improves , but it would also be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> will worry about it all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are <unk> .
in closing , you read this cartoon , and , a <unk> person , says , &quot; ah ! what this fish is ?
you know , it &apos;s not possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i think that the fish is something .
because the truth is that if you break it down , it &apos;s so that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> , so that &apos;s all possible , you lose happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost true of perfect certainty -- potentially , for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what that means could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we try to create the digital code in a new phase of biology by creating new life and building new life .
we always have important questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think is that many biologists have tried to understand and that at different levels .
we have different approaches to simplify it to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve nearly nearly 20 years , when we sequenced the <unk> , the shift to shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of biology .
so now we &apos;re going to try to wonder if we can regenerate life , or whether we can make new life , that digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve been able to give it about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that there are .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our -- trust me , that &apos;s simple , but when we all look at these genes , it &apos;s very unlikely that would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way in the front of that chromosome is actually a little bit of what allows us to vary and so some of the fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , we can make a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps for the <unk> of life is exponentially .
our ability genetic code has evolved very slowly , but still , and our final point would be now on an exponential curve .
we &apos;ve started 15 years ago .
it took a few years out with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , <unk> is very hard .
there &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , and it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , right ?
so we had to design a new way that we could put these little pieces together and the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that &apos;s killing bacteria .
we made little pieces , and they made a <unk> and had a dna molecule by about 5,000 letters .
so the exciting phase came when we took this piece of <unk> chemical took into a bacteria and a bacteria , and that bacteria began to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were <unk> by the cells and they would come back and kill e. coli .
i recently talked to the oil industry , and they said that they kind of model this model .
they laughed more than her .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that actually can build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in the <unk> of the virus that we could vary the size of a living .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information is really <unk> .
when we sequenced the genome first in 1995 , the <unk> at a mistake was a <unk> base .
what we found was 30 errors , if we used to use the initial sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design of design is to create pieces of the 50 letters long and the other <unk> bits to build smaller <unk> to build smaller <unk> .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
we started just signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we have the pieces so that we could easily capture them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that these are enzymes and back together .
and we started making these pieces of five to the <unk> of the five to the <unk> of the characters , put these together in order to make this back together , to <unk> this together .
so in every time we get these pieces of the surplus in the surplus and we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of <unk> .
so this looks like a <unk> .
if we &apos;re going to get to those right big pieces -- with over 100,000 pairs of <unk> -- then they &apos;re not just in e. coli .
we knew from a mechanism called the <unk> called the biology that uses dna to fix the dna .
here &apos;s an example . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of three million rads of radiation .
you can see in the upper field that &apos;s just falling apart .
12 and 24 hours later , it &apos;s all over again .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can actually live in a vacuum in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space , and it can move on the search of conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many things out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> from the molecule that we made these processes -- in fact , we used to use these processes -- in fact , we put them <unk> with the right design of the pieces that we put them in .
this is not a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
this is footage over the last six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve done recently recently .
these are about <unk> letters in <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by the people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and <unk> , it would be <unk> pages , just about these genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we do it ?
it &apos;s obvious that it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s easier when you &apos;re in <unk> like we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out , and you &apos;re just in the <unk> , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve heard about the clones .
in <unk> , the chromosome is in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you could give a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to others .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . so , they &apos;re both as far as people and mice , we gave some <unk> to destroy this chromosome , and it was very amazing to destroy all the proteins .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there &apos;s the end of the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process .
this is the <unk> evolution of evolution .
we find all species of species that took a second chromosome or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of characteristics in just a second one second .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the <unk> , which is actually digest .
the chromosome that the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve put in .
it was deposited in the cell <unk> and the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had a cell at the end of a cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , all of it had lost all the characteristics of species , and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins that changed the edges changes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have .
it may sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can , by <unk> , things quite dramatic change .
now , i think this is not the <unk> -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i think that we could be able to create a new shape of the cambrian explosion in the cambrian there in this digital explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re from six billion people from six billion people in the next 40 years .
so in my context , i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three of people are born on this planet for every year in 1946 , within 40 years , it will be four .
we have trouble with food , with fresh water and clean water , medicine , fuel for <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million volumes a day .
if we think about biology processes , or any of the process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 from that material that &apos;s going on in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of it .
so we &apos;re in the first line of the biological reality of the biological reality of the biological reality .
we have now <unk> technology because of this rapid <unk> to what we call <unk> genetics .
so we have the opportunity to make a big robot to build the millions of chromosomes .
if you can imagine these 20 million different genes or these processes to optimize these processes to optimize <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can only change a little group of molecular change than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a photograph of the actual <unk> <unk> of the work that you actually work with , and new species on the computer design .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily understand what it is going to be . we know exactly what &apos;s going to look like genetic code .
we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
now , you &apos;ve just seen corn <unk> , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation that are relatively soon , much higher , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think the only way of biology is a big impact with no other growth , or the limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as the world , and therefore we &apos;re working on the cells that are going on that way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first part of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a technique .
but in our discovery , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> co2 in methane by using hydrogen as energy .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use <unk> co2 , which could be easily <unk> , mimics the co2 in the fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> goals of all the <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise ?
but the same thing we &apos;re working on is that the same way that we use vaccines for development .
you &apos;ve seen it this year with the flu , we &apos;ve always seen a year , and you have a little bit when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that it &apos;s going to be changed by the <unk> vaccines .
this is what the future might look like , can change changes today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re light years away from human beings . our goal is to survive that we have a chance to survive long enough enough to survive . thank you .
at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised back to come back like the machine works .
so now it &apos;s like , and for all those who were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that has ever been , 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second after the beginning of the universe -- and it &apos;s made up to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . it &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction column that you see the scale .
on september 10th of september last september , the machine was the first time .
and this picture was taken from atlas .
there &apos;s huge huge <unk> in the control system .
it &apos;s an image of the first <unk> that all the way around the lhc , then <unk> <unk> with a part of the lhc , to put a rain of particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is the largest <unk> , or that , as someone who went to visit the google and the front door .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that deals with these calculators here -- these golden wires .
these wires lead <unk> <unk> when the machine goes on <unk> .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far down , you &apos;re going to <unk> them .
so , at minus <unk> , cooler , cooler than the space between the stars , you can make these <unk> tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> <unk> in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and it <unk> its wires , and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> <unk> .
this was the result .
now , this is all about the story , if you think that the magnet is about 20 tons , and they &apos;re about 30 feet .
so we converted around 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all over again .
at the end , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and i can expect to collect first data in june or july , and we put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way that accidents look like the value of science and the <unk> of science , it &apos;s easy to be something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s hard is hard to make the fact that we reach beyond our limits .
i &apos;m going to give my english word words to a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as i suspect when he was the <unk> of his <unk> , his name was , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , his name was so dangerous to the development of the human mind . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books too is my job , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that change .
but a recent thing about my life is a strange thing in my life and my career that helped me to rethink my relationship .
so this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , decided , decided to be different than all my previous books for some of the reasons in the world .
the result is that i don &apos;t care about where i was going to be treated .
let &apos;s work seriously .
for example , they come up with me and say , &quot; don &apos;t fear that success will never be <unk> ?
don &apos;t you worry about it that they were going to <unk> her whole life , and never again a book that anyone in the world ? no ?
okay , it &apos;s really <unk> .
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> did you have no fear , never succeed ?
don &apos;t you worry about that people who kill humiliation ?
did you not fear that for the craft you live for life , and it &apos;s never going to get something that you will die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
and i always had .
and i was frightened of a lot more things that nobody would get .
like algae -- and other things do .
but when i write about writing , i think about asking myself , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that by someone should be expected to be afraid to do the work of work ?
and what &apos;s exactly going to do with the creative companies that you &apos;re insecure about the <unk> of the relationship -- in a way , the other people do not ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist that he was asked , if he was scared to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about it ?
it &apos;s just not before , you know ?
but in order to be fair -- the group of the chemist is not going to have the <unk> of <unk> people over the centuries .
we also seem to seem to have this kind of <unk> , but not just the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to be the mentally being mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is remember the bitter <unk> of really great minds from the twentieth century to see the young and often died of their own hands .
and even those who didn &apos;t really <unk> <unk> , seemed to be neglected , seemed to be neglected .
norman <unk> said before his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books has killed me a little further .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even think if we &apos;re somebody saying something like this , because we &apos;ve been aware of that kind of evidence since that , somehow , we have the notion of such a long and collective accepted that creativity -- -- in the end -- always leads to the <unk> .
the question i want to do today is , is this idea for all of you right now : is this idea for you all right ?
if you think about it ? because with just one centimeter , i feel that i feel with one centimeter at all .
i find them .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s going to take the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative habit .
and i definitely know that it was to me -- in my situation , in my situation -- very , very , very dangerous , to start to start to start to begin in my career in my career .
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s probably absolutely that all i &apos;m going to write about is what &apos;s going to be used from the world as being used to the work of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of friends -- it &apos;s probably most of my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what thought !
these are the kind of thought that someone can make someone to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d like to keep doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while , the <unk> seems to me that i could continue to write to write a kind of <unk> psychological designs .
somehow , i need to find a way to write a safe distance , and i &apos;m going to write a <unk> distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how to be the <unk> .
while i was looking at models for this last year , i &apos;ve been looking for that , i &apos;ve been looking at other societies , and i tried to find other societies to see if you could help creative risks with the emotional risks that connect with creativity .
this quest to bring me into the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome haven &apos;t believed that people didn &apos;t believe that creativity of people &apos;s coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is from a distant , unknown source of people -- from <unk> , unknown .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
by socrates , he &apos;s known that he thought he would have a <unk> that he would make him out of a distance .
the roman had the same idea , called this sort of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> .
that &apos;s great . didn &apos;t really think that a genius didn &apos;t really know that a genius individual individual was .
they believed that a genius of magic was <unk> creatures who believed that it was literally in the walls of a living in the walls -- something like <unk> , the <unk> and the artist , and the artist &apos;s work is invisible .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological thing that i protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everyone knew that it worked , right ?
the artists of the <unk> was to protect certain things , like , for example , too much . right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all the time for you . every knew that you had this <unk> genius that you helped .
when your work <unk> -- it &apos;s not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so people have a really long time thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s make the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no room more for unpleasant creatures .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism , and the people began to believe that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in the story , you &apos;re listening to people that or giving a genius of a genius , like a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of a mere person , he thinks that he thinks it or she &apos;s like the <unk> , like the pelvis and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , infinite <unk> is a little bit of responsibility .
it &apos;s like somebody to request the sun .
and it &apos;s made and <unk> all the egos , and it creates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> had our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe in an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can not just <unk> the <unk> 500 years just in a <unk> lecture .
and there &apos;s a lot of people in this audience that really <unk> scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> , <unk> people and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you to this journey .
but the question i want to ask is , why not ?
why not that ?
because it makes a lot of sense like anything else , which i heard when it went to that , that &apos;s absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> of the creative process .
a process that is -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s trying to make something -- so in other words , in fact , everyone here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s kind of <unk> .
i had an encounter encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , which is now over 90 , but she told me she was poet , and she told me that she was poet in <unk> virginia . she said she &apos;d feel like a poem .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
and the land on her land was <unk> .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could only be just one of them , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> running like the devil <unk> .
they ran as the devil to the house while she was tracked by this poem , and it was the only thing that they had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen to get it through it , and on the sheet .
at other point , they didn &apos;t get fast enough . they ran and ran and run around , but she reached the house , and the poem she didn &apos;t , she said , <unk> for a <unk> .
and then there was these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were no moments in which they were almost missed .
so , she runs to the house , looking after paper , and the poem goes through her , and she gets a pencil when it comes through her <unk> and then -- she was so much as if it was going to reach .
she <unk> the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took it on the paper paper .
so , at all the time , the poem came out and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first one .
and when i heard that , i thought <unk> that &apos;s scary -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i got to stand up every day at the same time , and sweat , and i &apos;m <unk> and really unpleasant .
but i even myself in my <unk> sometimes sometimes this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done it .
i even worked or ideas that made from a source of me that i can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing for ?
and how do we deal with this relationship without losing our minds , but we don &apos;t think of the contrary to intellectual health ?
for me , the most living example of how you can do this , the musicians can do tom <unk> . i gave him a few years ago for a magazine interview .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment , tom &apos;s embodiment , who was trying to hurt these <unk> of modern art that was trying to hurt with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he was telling me that he had one day on a freeway in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he was running at high speed when he suddenly hears a little patch of melody , which is how it &apos;s about a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and he wants it . she &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . he can &apos;t grab it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to see this old <unk> in it , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to lose this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of panic , he just heard about it .
he ended up all of the thought , and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , sorry , can you see that i drive your car ?
<unk> i see as i could do a song ?
if you really want to exist , come on a moment , come to a moment when i can take care .
if not , you know , <unk> one day .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as dark and the ones .
but the process of the process and the heavy equipment that surrounds it was , when he took the word out , he was <unk> , and he was where he was kind of <unk> , and he realized that there was no <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , funny , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing , which was not quite angry .
when i heard this story , it was a bit like i worked a little bit like i worked , and i &apos;ve never saved myself .
this idea was saved me in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> . i fell in one of those commonalities of the <unk> in which we fall , when we work on something , it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> this project .
but then i remember like tom in the business sky , and i was trying to do it .
so i took my gaze off the manuscript and i talked to my commentary in the direction of the room .
i mentioned loud : <unk> stop , you know , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s right ?
because you see that i have anything that i &apos;m investing . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to show you up here , and you &apos;ve got your own run .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the hell you don &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to write more , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a record that i was today for my part of the jobs .
because ... -- at the end of it , it &apos;s like the following , many centuries ago , in the deserts of <unk> people with holy dances and <unk> music for hours -- until the dawn .
they were always great because the dancer were professional professionals and they were fantastic .
but again , i rarely rarely happened something special . one of the characters was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you all of the life in your life , you &apos;ve seen this kind of performance .
it was like the time <unk> and the dancers through some kind of <unk> . he did nothing else than he had ever done before he did -- 1,000 nights before .
and all of a sudden , he had no longer whatsoever .
it was <unk> and down by the bottom , and it &apos;s all <unk> through a <unk> fire .
when something happened at the time , people knew what was that people called it in his name .
they put hands together , and they started singing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came out of the <unk> , they brought this practice . the <unk> changed over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is still <unk> and <unk> .
if a actors in spain can do something magic , something magic has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- great , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , of course , the tricky part of the next morning when the dancers turned out to wake up and see that it was 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday , and he no longer a <unk> of god .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe he will never get back to these heights .
and it &apos;s probably never going to be somebody &apos;s name when he &apos;s spinning , but what &apos;s supposed to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> aspect of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very full of <unk> , if they didn &apos;t believe in the beginning of it , that &apos;s most extraordinary aspects of their existence .
if you may just believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life that &apos;s passed on somebody else when they &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think i &apos;ve been working on the last few months while i was working on the book that &apos;s been going to be going to appear -- when the dangerous , frightening , powerful , is my <unk> success .
so what i &apos;m constantly saying to myself , when i &apos;m crazy it is , i &apos;m not afraid .
it &apos;s not <unk> .
make your job .
it &apos;s still not for your contribution , whatever it may be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid of god &apos;s genius , you decide to decide to decide for a brief moment of wonder through your efforts , then <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe that , and i feel that we should teach that .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for that , you know , you just love the human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> that the arctic <unk> , the size of the bottom , the bottom states had gone to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press very much enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic are the <unk> heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> which has happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is in red .
as you can see , it grows on the <unk> , and this is the <unk> ice ice , and it &apos;s summertime the summer .
the so-called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming is the frozen reason around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s vast amounts of carbon dioxide , which is when it &apos;s <unk> , of microbes , of microbes .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> substances in the atmosphere , it could double double when we cross this critical point .
already , there are <unk> in a few flat lakes in alaska from the water itself .
professor <unk> walter <unk> <unk> <unk> in alaska with another group to another <unk> lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is how it &apos;s going to be us .
and a reason is , this is a huge <unk> <unk> of the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are substantially bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in greenland .
if you want to know how the sea sea is flowing through <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> into the sea .
these rivers are starting to melt .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers have documented that the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that took over a couple of <unk> , is particularly very powerful .
this is a 20 foot <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , looking at the top of new lakes , a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their <unk> out of the world .
in the andes , this glacier is the glacier for this town .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in california in california .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as they read them , are serious .
these <unk> throughout the world will lead to a dramatic increase in the world .
and the disasters all over the world have really <unk> , and we never have an area of magnitude .
four times as many of the last 30 years , like the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right now , from the u.s. continent , the american continent is <unk> where there &apos;s a typical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one is a factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which 20 percent is , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and the coal is biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , and with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other <unk> .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
so here are the ones that over the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last <unk> to <unk> clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this is a picture of me .
around christmas , christmas fell at me in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> america .
this was about christmas .
one of the advertisement for the <unk> was to the christmas .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance in america , and it helps our economies grow .
<unk> , the <unk> is <unk> every day .
he &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and they stay in <unk> and bread in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of the majority in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for success is two <unk> .
this is one part of her .
in <unk> , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
so it &apos;s why we spend on top of the top of a major <unk> <unk> to spend a <unk> on the way that the truth is about .
the fact is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells of it .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave it .
<unk> coal , you have a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the <unk> <unk> .
and yet , the burning of the global warming is global warming , which is the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here changes everything .
look at it right now , this is the present , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the economy , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these together is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there is a bold , new solution to us from this <unk> situation .
<unk> america with 100 percent of electricity , in the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan to make america back to work more secure and to help the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence fuels from the old , dirty fuels that our world is <unk> .
the future is here . the wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment for making good jobs for jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old <unk> to say , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we need to be far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask for the time of your childhood <unk> when they were playing with <unk> .
while they realized how to reach the hands and <unk> the <unk> , and you move the <unk> and move problems through understanding and change .
the spatial thinking is intimately connected to how we understand most of our surroundings .
so as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- combined with my <unk> and my colleagues <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i started wonder : what if we could use computers , instead of a <unk> , who &apos;s moving to a flat spot , instead of ... ...
so this question was that we decided that we decided to study the answer and we developed the <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move with your hand , you can look at each other , you can capture each other , and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are physically physically , why you can only reach them out how to reach it through that hands and access it .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and when these tools will be physical and consciousness for their motions , each other recognizes and the subtleties of our <unk> with them , then we can detect new and more entertaining .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this is <unk> <unk> , and if i turn it into a direction , it &apos;s going to play the video , if i <unk> it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so , if i put them side-by-side , you make it .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that you can find something nervous .
and they &apos;re feeling like their motions and pitch .
so , an interesting thing about interactions we started to see is that we could use everyday gestures on data , like colors as well as to as colors as you do this .
in this case , we have three <unk> than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to cut color into the middle of the middle store , where you &apos;re going to mix .
if we overdo it , we can make a little <unk> .
there &apos;s also a couple of nice opportunities in education like languages languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the opportunity to go and find the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series that i &apos;m with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of combination of <unk> and <unk> .
in fact , you &apos;ve got every round round of every <unk> randomly randomly and while you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re going to be a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s going to be mixed again and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are a few children who came up with a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and read a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; do words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> on the bottom right .
it turned out that he wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to design a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can put new characters in the scene by using the <unk> of the table that shows the character .
here it lets the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work ! yes !
by taking the <unk> shake and you can put it next to each other .
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open and he can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example , for that i have time , it &apos;s a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the <unk> as a sound , like <unk> , bass and drums drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence of the sequence you can sequence in any patterns .
and you <unk> them , by just a <unk> <unk> .
there are the effects that you can change live , like reverberant and filter .
you hook it with a particular note , and it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
and then again , the effects of how the speed and volume that you &apos;re in the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to go into two <unk> <unk> and these in a row , and those in a row , they extend a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit more drums .
and now i combine the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of life .
i can speed the whole sequence , by the speed of the pace , by the speed or a different direction .
and now i &apos;m going to put the filter on the bass ; for a little more expression .
i can change the sequence as it is .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan it in <unk> , but it can improvise ; it &apos;s <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> .
and finally , i can <unk> the entire sequence of the sequence , by drawing the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is how to develop new <unk> , which is better to the fit of how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways that we work in our lab .
so the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re at the verge of this new generation of <unk> to interaction with digital media , information information in our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to talk with them all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited to me .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i need to start a little bit back to a <unk> , and that &apos;s a <unk> with the modern molecular molecular .
i study biology , and i &apos;ve been a few years with the <unk> <unk> , and i started because i just wanted to know , because i just wanted to know what i &apos;ve learned in the study of how i &apos;ve learned in the study of the study .
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think the molecular molecular biology now , so generally , biotechnology , everything you really count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , is extremely important , and more importantly , much more important will be much more important in the future .
there &apos;s been so controversial things like this all the way that all of these are <unk> plants .
so there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> <unk> trying to make it <unk> , so gas from algae .
there &apos;s also some things that are totally in the day , but what most people are not aware of , for example , that most people who allow us to wash up with 40 degrees of laundry are also <unk> .
and the list can continue on endlessly .
and so from interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going to continue to <unk> on this technology .
so what ?
most of the most people most people know this from the <unk> .
computer <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be like that in the media , yes , the hackers break down somewhere , and it &apos;s so on .
this is a kind of thing that &apos;s very sad for the <unk> very sad , because it &apos;s not that what it was like , actually , and what &apos;s it is .
and this is actually the <unk> , in the <unk> &apos; 70s , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s also about the internet .
and it &apos;s about a positive , creative , creative way , solving a problem .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a <unk> of what kind of simplify them , and how things simplify , so you can make it better .
and it &apos;s got to do with software , but it &apos;s also there , but it &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s a whole <unk> to do all kinds of things .
and now , now , even in biology , and i want to make this metaphor , which is that , from synthetic biology , is that biology is actually a <unk> code , because , the <unk> code is a abstract code that is , yes , it &apos;s not just like the computer , because it &apos;s dynamic .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program that , and you can also hack it , so , and that i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
it &apos;s actually <unk> eight to eight times these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally in switzerland , this is connected with europe and with a cooperation in india , but there &apos;s also a <unk> or active people all around the world .
so that &apos;s what has more artistic orientation , so there are many artists and philosophers and philosophers and working with scientists with these technologies that are going through these technologies and ask the creative process , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually about to find such a <unk> access to try to find such a <unk> way .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network of a network , which is actually a kind of forum where you are , and online , <unk> .
they &apos;re kind of a technical kind of <unk> and a little bit of a <unk> way , and then you &apos;re going to ask that , yes , <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that have made the whole <unk> , has been a scene that i &apos;d like to <unk> .
so here in the image on the left , you see <unk> , this is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , so a private school , a nonprofit and a nonprofit society where anyone can do .
kids , old , all kinds of people going to go there to just go through a lab and look at them through a lab and look at what can you do when these <unk> .
here on the left , there &apos;s a group in indonesia , <unk> , <unk> , who &apos;s quite long .
more than these other networks .
and the ones in such an artistic aspect of dealing with biological materials and , yes , also , <unk> , and combine it in a pretty <unk> way .
another group of ankara that i met for a while for a while , you have met this one for a while who wanted to go to the public more than what they learn in school , and they &apos;ve got so so that little action is made and people in school .
and i put in the other image of a lecture into copenhagen museum in copenhagen museum in combination with an exhibition .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s most of the most frequent people , but the only thing is , what &apos;s all the united states , is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and it also applies to the society and asking , so , okay , what do you want to work on , do you know what do you do .
so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need some material .
you need of course biological materials , and you also need tools , and this is a lab .
or what you &apos;re usually in the lab is that kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive machines , extremely expensive machines , extremely smooth , and so on .
and our approach was just saying to say , <unk> , that &apos;s not to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every every one has actually evolved higher technology as most <unk> , technology , that &apos;s really , really .
and there &apos;s an premise that premise with this premise of the premise of brian <unk> in the u.k. , then a <unk> <unk> , then then a <unk> , <unk> , yes , so it &apos;s got bacteria <unk> .
so every one of the time , a soup of <unk> is that he has left too long .
and i put that in my lab home , a little bit , and i put a little bit on the <unk> ebay on ebay and doing a little <unk> analysis , a <unk> , so <unk> <unk> , even at home .
now , this isn &apos;t supposed to be a joke .
here in the picture , in the picture , you see the lab , in <unk> , so this is a <unk> garage with a <unk> garage that brought in college &apos;s garage , a group in paris that has gone and quite successful things .
and this is <unk> , who also mentioned mentioned <unk> , this is a kind of <unk> principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you can see it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so this is a relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s the time of people who are going to make it in the home so far up to the <unk> shape .
but always the idea of the approach is that it &apos;s easy to be easy and to be accessible .
so the first project that we did was as an international group , as we were aware of ourselves , <unk> , we have now been aware of our own scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know that people are always going online .
and then from the <unk> <unk> website , the founders of the founders , and said , we &apos;ve got to really hit ourselves , and then put two of these things in london , <unk> 10 , and shortly in the <unk> , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco ,
and then there &apos;s also about , yes , <unk> , who are what we want to do , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what is our goals , our foundation ?
and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
so it was quite intuitive , so everybody has just like this wish , his wishes , his and what it was going to do .
there was , i think , a very good code .
and we don &apos;t have the end of it , but that &apos;s what i think is , i think it &apos;s pretty well , i think it &apos;s pretty well , people are quite convinced .
and we actually have tried to <unk> this into the academic world again , but there &apos;s no way it &apos;s not going to get that .
so i think we &apos;re out of the <unk> in the direction , even as the <unk> world .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do now ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland itself was that we call an optical optical case or optical <unk> .
this is when you &apos;re focused on a beam , in a room , then you can catch little particles in the air , or in the fluid , and then , in the fluid , so it &apos;s been there , so as a <unk> principle .
this really works , this is going to be done in the academic , and we &apos;ve thought , <unk> , that we might get a webcam , then we took a webcam , the <unk> , the lens , the lens <unk> , you have a microscope .
you see that there &apos;s down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> laser <unk> laser and then tries to focus on this camera .
and it didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we haven &apos;t learned a lot .
so another project that comes from french group in paris , which has been working in paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he does , as a <unk> , such a <unk> , so <unk> or something , so it &apos;s related to <unk> , his name is sam <unk> .
he &apos;s got this helmet there , and in the cooperation with the museum , and in cooperation with the museum .
so there could go into the room in the room , sit down on the chair , wearing these helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they were thinking , is there &apos;s different lights in space .
was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which is also involved with this <unk> device here , is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to <unk> genes , to breed , <unk> , fragments , fragments that you can make them visible .
so if i do that the <unk> <unk> at the scene , they go to collect any <unk> , and then they &apos;re doing this , then they can say <unk> , and then you can say , <unk> , this belongs to this person , like this .
and the machines that are doing this kind of thing that are pretty expensive that you buy commercial , which is the way that they &apos;re doing <unk> .
and that &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of a lot of a lot .
and they &apos;ve got two of two builders <unk> and said , <unk> , that &apos;s what we do , and it &apos;s cheaper , and then then made up open source , so open source , <unk> , that this device is <unk> and are now the cheapest <unk> of these devices .
i think so six dollars or something .
but it &apos;s still not cheap , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in any case where it &apos;s been available .
so i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
a project that i started recently had to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about as far , two centimeters or so .
you put <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and then put them into these <unk> , and then i shot them on a tennis shot , and then it &apos;s like this .
so the device that you see there is not working .
but that &apos;s my prototype that &apos;s so my prototype that looks pretty much like this , so on a branch of doing that , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure that was broken .
and then i took a <unk> , and it &apos;s about it .
a <unk> , if you got a full pressure with the water , so i think that &apos;s 40 to <unk> bar .
and then you can accelerate the particles as well , and then they &apos;re going to go into it .
and the commercial device costs about 16,000 dollars or something like something that is 50 euros .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
and this is a moment that &apos;s also the <unk> of the scene of the scene , this availability of technology , that availability of technology , and also the information that is more people can engage in .
because , as in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little sense of it and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as you did it yourself .
and i think technology is more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a <unk> citizen , make meaningful decisions in society , wants to be able to get , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to make it and understand it and understand it .
and the <unk> , then under the <unk> open <unk> and <unk> .
so , you know , you know , as a human being able to do with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they are represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think is there are fewer people in there than actually exist .
so i know some people who don &apos;t have .
and this is just the <unk> , the individual people .
in part , with these <unk> , these places , these places .
and this is very beginning .
as i said , <unk> has started .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a giant network of very good network , yes , <unk> that all around the world are represented around .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to look like the same thing as well , and they &apos;re also similar to the same connected , so that &apos;s going to be more people involved .
and i would like to invite everybody to deal with this , and even even more what .
it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not possible , but it &apos;s not possible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there .
thank you for listening .
it was .
yeah , hi .
how do we work people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moving to me as a designer designer , but also in the <unk> <unk> , and in <unk> , in front of all things in the field .
and it &apos;s about how people are in interactive media , so they &apos;re going to use these interactive media and so they can create a <unk> experience .
i think that the interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , so the paradigm that are in our biological memory , so a long time ago , and that we &apos;ve been in a very long time , and we can create interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these <unk> , you &apos;ve seen that the <unk> actually gets into the future , but in fact it &apos;s so that the future is right in us .
so what are <unk> models ?
i went to four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to you .
<unk> cognitive models and that are the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
so to these models models , that we heard a rather natural relationship for us .
that sounds in principle of this unusual .
i &apos;m going to put it right now , and i &apos;m going to prove them to prove that they can prove a natural relationship to the place .
so the second aspect is that we &apos;re able to be models since this <unk> models , very , very brain models , even though we can use a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains himself .
we all know that the interactive media is <unk> by definition , which is the denial of the linearity , and what &apos;s of course is that we feel that we can feel the linearity as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us .
now , what is the most natural thing with virtuality is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want you to prove this .
how many doors did the house that you live in ?
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen now , and just happening .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it &apos;s <unk> reality , and it &apos;s a lot of computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a hard for us to show the <unk> reality of our virtual reality , and we can actually show that the whole time .
and these assets , the virtual reality of the reality of the reality that people have been in the pre-industrial times of <unk> , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that had had been her head .
and in that head , memory was a memory .
in this head , you know , <unk> and using these virtual images , the imagination were passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with that virtuality .
the interesting thing about it is , if i can take a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s all .
and the interesting thing about this time is that this time of man at the same time , <unk> and medium itself .
now , if you think a little further .
what are the world today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you right now .
most of the <unk> tool have been to have been hearing .
<unk> , priests , so-called so-called <unk> , were actually <unk> to keep knowledge of knowledge in stories .
and also today we &apos;re very , very powerful at stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still <unk> every year hours with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a child that &apos;s most of the most <unk> most of the most time most of his life has been spent with the <unk> of stories .
now , we think our love to tell stories is that we have a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
that goes back to the cultures of the pre-industrial time .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as a particularly powerful media , we &apos;re in <unk> memory in our biological memory , the ability to think of <unk> .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north tribe of north tribe .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you &apos;ve got to navigate from island island to get food .
and they did this with the so-called <unk> .
you might know that if you &apos;re a little bit more interested in the australian world , by the australian .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have <unk> , but they have the so-called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the <unk> and the topography of regions via the songs are being turned .
where the language was <unk> by <unk> .
that is , you know , you know about sound and about rhythm .
and these <unk> and the rhythm had the geology , the topography of the region , and also , of course , that you could have these songs of <unk> and other things , and so on the left and back back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we know anymore to get from the top of a b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happened ?
it &apos;s going to happen so <unk> machine .
we &apos;ve moved to the <unk> <unk> .
now , what happens is the machine , and it &apos;s happened , and what &apos;s happened is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the <unk> of our individual memories with external media .
on the book and the image .
so we have unfortunately a piece of god &apos;s a piece of <unk> .
so in conclusion , demographers have become alien alien for ourselves , and i have to do nothing more .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> on the <unk> , is that way that these mass media , he thinks that these mass media , he says the book , so on tv , so what we call the television and the internet , so what we call this mass mass , so on the internet .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
<unk> for the machine .
what does things affect our thinking and on our <unk> ?
and then the <unk> motion of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to have more and more <unk> over the course of the centuries and more <unk> through the <unk> .
so , instead of being able to remember , we have standardized , very common patterns in masses of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we produce no longer .
we have an abstract language of language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing anymore , in pictures of things , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve used to know that things are linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as a law , and there &apos;s just still exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s left is the <unk> .
still , we are the <unk> as a <unk> very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine , and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and i &apos;m looking at a science fiction .
but these concepts of the <unk> that will bring us these back back to our capabilities .
here it is about stratford , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to quickly explain a little bit .
there &apos;s a technical concepts like that , like the <unk> reality , that is the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then a concept of what makes us virtual world with the real world to combine the real world with the real world , which is virtual , natural as a normal , natural way back .
another example is that virtual reality .
so , of course , this is how crazy in the context of my presentation , that &apos;s where we &apos;re moving into <unk> , virtual virtual worlds , right after the model of <unk> .
and another example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are rooms that will respond to people .
all that takes the ability to accept our fundamental ability to accept that in order for a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the end , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re also today today .
maybe you can just stand up for a minute , you can stand up with yourself in the pause with the project .
and this project as an example , as an example , again , again , again , again , about this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say that .
so what the hell of course is extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you know , you &apos;re probably very likely to have any people in front of some <unk> <unk> or they &apos;re playing with some sort of <unk> in your hand .
in every case , they &apos;re doing that .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s where i think that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data <unk> that we produce , which is that we produce the real world .
i apologize i need so much .
you can make it much better , there &apos;s more much more than that , there &apos;s more much more behind it .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s about is that i discover a city by looking at how much positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get a completely different sight of the city , a very different impression , which is negative and positive zones of a city , and it &apos;s so a different , virtual map of a city , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world is coming into the walls of our cities , yeah .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize this , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk and that in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve got out of the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the machine that we &apos;ve collected from the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s how we walked back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to you .
i &apos;ve been wondering if this bag is going to be a <unk> bag and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m going to throw it out of the same thing , which is inside .
but so far , i &apos;m not going to do it .
yes , children are inherently curious about nature , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of the house , so i &apos;m also involved with the subject of curiosity and how to change the curiosity , and why does the curiosity again , and why don &apos;t we lose curiosity and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking at with the actual experience as a result .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> them , they &apos;re often <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half year .
a <unk> for natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask you , why are all the designers involved in themselves with so natural <unk> communication , interactions and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because the things are becoming more intuitive , more natural , and more natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what is <unk> or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i have to design myself in the field of natural design , so the next generation of the human computer is to human computer in the relationship with the <unk> computer to deal with our tools like the computer , or how to use the computer from the computer .
so i was busy doing this , when is what of course or intuitively .
maybe again , a look at this .
why does this happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , right now , we &apos;re going to move forward from the third of the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from the modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning of the language , through the language .
so , you know , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked a shared language , you could communicate with each other , it &apos;s built in the same cave , or in other parts , cities are educated or <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
so , you know , you can &apos;t learn from nature to talk to you , but we &apos;re learning about it , and then of course , of course .
this is the <unk> society and the first form of abstraction .
that was at the time , a <unk> , because of course , the living language began to <unk> in a form that is called the <unk> and alive , and i go , and i put it in stone , and i &apos;m going to <unk> it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story , of course , as if it &apos;s a lifetime of view .
but then , <unk> <unk> , then this script as a <unk> .
then the next generation that we &apos;re living today is actually living in life today .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was the same as a <unk> , where <unk> , <unk> and other words , are actually insane when the people start to read , and then that &apos;s , of course , absolutely <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation and the exciting thing , so a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re at the moment in this phase stage that we &apos;re involved in .
so the confused of all of us , of course , is because we see on one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with the total of complete transparency , which is the new thinking , don &apos;t say that in the <unk> <unk> , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> , and no beef phenomena , which is i &apos;m going to just <unk> and want it to <unk> .
and these two worlds , opening up , new and old .
and the exciting thing is , if you look at this new society , these new society , <unk> very much of a lot of mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but not more on the local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
the theme of ecology is a global .
not if i think about a local organic , and the neighbor is less organic , it doesn &apos;t work .
this is , from the local village , actually a global village has become the same principles , of course , very intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so , as you know in the village , who has knew what to do with whom and when , the way that happens today is about this expansion of our self through this mobile level .
it is that we know globally , and always faster , and they &apos;re always better .
that &apos;s how it happened to the village that happened to the village .
before the back of the background , i &apos;ve got to look at this , which is that it &apos;s actually for us , of course , what is , of course , what we might do , of course what makes the difference ?
because often , people come up , they can &apos;t make it <unk> so that anyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with this , which is because it &apos;s not just changing it , but it should be better .
and then , of course , when , of course , something intuitively , and how can i take care of how to take action and make things so that they &apos;re a <unk> , so that they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re simple .
so , you too , as well as a student , with the theme of perception and the <unk> .
and so , of course , that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at and watch and look like , okay , now i &apos;m going into the inner self .
and what does it matter in fact ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and what does mean actually , of course , intuitively , and how do we work our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process ?
because steve jobs once said to you , you know , you <unk> your <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at all the details , if i want to make something <unk> or intuitive , what does that mean .
and you see , you know , you &apos;re a our seven senses , most of you think we &apos;ve only got five , right now , there &apos;s seven <unk> , there &apos;s certainly seven <unk> , there is certainly the next one of our own .
and how do we process information , how do we take information ?
by saying , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many of the use of the word , don &apos;t know what it means to do .
but i need to understand how to understand , in the understanding of what &apos;s going to happen , when you &apos;re data from data , and from information , and from information , so i know how i can do things with things or of course .
and of course , how does design influence on perception .
and we can see this when i make things , i can look at them as much as i can , on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can make it kind of intuitively .
so a lot of natural natural ones in a tank , but i can see it directly where is salt and pepper .
and if i tell somebody , you give me the salt or pepper pepper , then he &apos;s going to figure out the right thing where is in .
and so on the left , so i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in there , and then i hope that no sugar will give salt to the salt .
but also , our perception itself , how does it make us .
for example , this perception in context .
so the right circle looks taller than the small , although it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same size , and yet it changes our perceptions , depending on what context we &apos;re doing things .
does anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> is supposed to work .
there &apos;s actually a little bit of my glasses .
so it &apos;s the case .
so a second circle starts to interact with some kind of or associate .
and if i &apos;m going to stop even a <unk> <unk> , then we don &apos;t just see another unit , which is circle , and circle , and , but we can see a unity of unity , we see a circle , a circle , another .
so this is what you call <unk> , or <unk> , who &apos;s also influenced us in the perception of perception .
so important for the designers , the most of the most frequently semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> the closeness of the continuity and so on .
so often , again .
but this is an essential important component , if you think of things in the things that &apos;s going to do that way .
so the next phenomenon , which is very interesting about this vision .
it sounds very trivial , but it &apos;s so exciting when you &apos;re busy busy .
so we have the front eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the beginning .
that &apos;s wrong .
they &apos;re looking at one of the back .
and she &apos;s <unk> , a thought that you see something you see , <unk> circle .
this is , we &apos;re going to <unk> our vision before we see it back to the back in our <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve got so much cognitive <unk> , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s then there , then , again , that comes back .
then it goes back to the front , because the back of the front , and says , look at the back of the front line , and it says , look at you , if you see what you want to see , you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s going to be .
so a very , very <unk> process , how do things happen and what kind of <unk> things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this image .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to see .
does anybody see something ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that there &apos;s a <unk> in it , you know that there &apos;s a <unk> in it , you know .
they &apos;re never going to forget , because i &apos;ll show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , now you can see it .
this is what i mean , i &apos;ve been able to make it now that you don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short time to see this dog in a very short image , and again , this dog &apos;s picture .
and that &apos;s projection of vision , <unk> , see .
now , i know , i &apos;m going to go forward to the front i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , is , in fact , gray is actually not , but there &apos;s a <unk> mass that &apos;s just <unk> .
anybody knows what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to knowledge as a designer .
if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of like to bridge the present into the <unk> , then i can bridge very well <unk> that i &apos;ll always bridge with three seconds .
it &apos;s got to be more than present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what do <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you love in love .
that means if you know that if you know this , look at who you like long , because i don &apos;t get a <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the most of the most of us we have .
so this is the first glimpse of this first impression in an fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we also see things , we &apos;re looking at what we &apos;re looking at , and we also sort of <unk> against our environment , so we can imagine that .
now , of course , the <unk> is not only related to the topic and <unk> neural or <unk> , but mostly with the theme of the theme of the <unk> .
so , as a human being involved in some things .
there &apos;s so much <unk> functions , so <unk> things or <unk> things .
there &apos;s <unk> where i know exactly where i need to reach .
but there &apos;s a symbolic functions , why there is a little <unk> for such a little bit of a <unk> , which is not so practical <unk> money in the money , although it &apos;s not so practical ?
there &apos;s a little bit of us on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we as designers of course .
back to my real topic , natural computing interface and the subject , which is , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> always means how can i achieve a certain goal , or how can you get a user <unk> in a certain way efficient and efficient and a goal .
that &apos;s the norm .
how can i make a little <unk> ?
i can do it right now , or i &apos;m going to use it , or i need it , i &apos;m an training training .
and less or <unk> is it .
i mean that i just make it differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you put in the software that we saw , then you &apos;re going to look at that , then you &apos;ll understand why <unk> percent of our world are little intuitively , or not to be <unk> in a lot of areas , or <unk> , although it &apos;s more intuitive than classic software as classic software .
this is intuitive <unk> not ever since apple is a basic <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i could make a technological devices of the people .
why ?
because the rule of this new kind of <unk> , which is the natural user , which is the natural user , are five times faster at the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that they &apos;re doing something the classic <unk> , five hours , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software .
so that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably want to be four hours to go home , but you can employers or anyone , you know , how he was working with four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a <unk> for us of course , of course things .
so if we &apos;re going to go back into the field of software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line of interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to work with these systems .
and then the next thing that can now do is <unk> neural model or mental model like the software <unk> , you have an idea of something called the metaphor , the metaphor , the metaphor to make the computer .
so not anymore , and they &apos;re ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
so it was a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s obviously obviously much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is a lot more to behavior .
so there &apos;s a lot more more frequently than a creator of the behavior .
this is also the paradigm shift .
i think that it &apos;s always <unk> for success , right now the <unk> will be a app .
and then when i take a step in these natural interfaces into these natural interfaces , where i &apos;m using a voice , by language , by <unk> , by the gesture , and no more or <unk> things , then i &apos;m going to go faster and another one .
but that leads me to the point , and again , when things are actually intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive and then i have to see my little friend here and look at my little friend here , and look , what does that mean , because of course , the <unk> is now intuitively ?
and that is always a little bit of intuitively people &apos;s always intuitively to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think he &apos;s not like to think , but it &apos;s just going to do .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does this mean for designers ?
so if we look at that , if we look at that we could be able to transfer <unk> from one to something else , like the metaphor , then i can use it .
this is , i can just transfer such an intuitive , human <unk> software to create a software that makes software <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what is the <unk> <unk> of us , and now i &apos;m going to tell you .
that &apos;s what we call <unk> .
it &apos;s used to each of us and <unk> is an acronym , and it &apos;s getting an acronym , <unk> , <unk> .
this is all of you all the time , but he &apos;s doing it unconsciously , and it &apos;s sort of intuitive , and it &apos;s partly intuitive .
the model is in the womb in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it &apos;s work around the world &apos;s young and old , and it &apos;s all used to be used without knowing that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to <unk> times about the activity , so in the sleep , you know , it &apos;s less often <unk> than a day .
now , i can get this mental <unk> configuration , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the <unk> , but now , no more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and if i <unk> this now , for example , when i get into the <unk> column , <unk> as a choice , you know , it &apos;s big on me , i can look at it somewhere or somebody or whatever , and so on .
then i can transfer this whole thing .
i &apos;m going to try this .
you know , apparently , everybody has lost cake .
<unk> : now i &apos;m using this object with the object , again , <unk> .
i &apos;m going to filter all the <unk> , can now filter it up , and i can tell you just for chocolate for chocolate .
and once again , a interface which is a lot more intuitive and very much natural natural .
because that i can reach the things like that can reach the way that can reach the way , and they come to me , is substantially natural than if it &apos;s <unk> <unk> pages or other kinds of things .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;d like to close with this phrase , i &apos;d like to close to a , a half-inch , and again , designers need to think differently for your attention , and in that sense , thank you right .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you become a child , as a child , is that they take care of what they do , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the <unk> to play more and less .
and the curiosity can &apos;t learn .
all these are the ones that are and curious about these are people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
now i &apos;m about , in fact , practically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years , <unk> in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> is a chance .
every day , they give each other for the day they give up two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to get two grams phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just be as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t do phosphorus , we &apos;re not phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re concerned with something that &apos;s actually a <unk> , but not so much .
because all talk about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have two years of phosphorus , and already , in the <unk> world &apos;s much more dynamic in the world much more dynamic in the environment than all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , there are <unk> tons of <unk> on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we do .
it does leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re slightly less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , goes down .
<unk> the environment , making less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but this is not protection .
this is how if i would say , <unk> your child &apos;s child , just three times rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit of destruction .
so if we think of that from the <unk> to the <unk> , our world used to be a <unk> or a <unk> .
that &apos;s how to think about the <unk> to <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the floor as a first time .
in the soil is about <unk> percent of the <unk> .
at the moment , we &apos;re building <unk> , and they &apos;re going to lose between 11 and 30 kilograms or 30 pounds per hectare , or to the square square .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than <unk> .
we can , of course , look at the <unk> .
and it &apos;s all packaging .
in <unk> for instance , at the <unk> of 20 percent of the <unk> &apos;s now <unk> .
and because we &apos;re getting older , they &apos;re going to be the <unk> .
that &apos;s all the way they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby needs a <unk> <unk> .
so we could reduce that 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is going into a second in china .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these <unk> ?
this is one of the proof that men are not pigs pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be about <unk> components across the solid components .
in the people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it is , right ?
traditionally , we think we &apos;re in <unk> , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and when you say the people who exist there , if you say it &apos;s better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , then they will not be there , and they will be hostile .
and as someone says al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you know the earth .
here &apos;s how it tells you the more <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants look at the weight of the ants on earth , then you weigh the ants about four times more than us .
i could also take termites , but in the u.s. , i don &apos;t like termites in the u.s.
that means that the ants are more much more than us .
and because they physically work a lot harder work than we , and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re equal to their weight , in between 30 months .
that is , we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we really wanted to do , and we could really do , and how sad we are that we &apos;re at all the time on earth , you can see that for example , you can see that , for example , a program , to 20 , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yeah ?
the only one .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yeah ?
one ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be more than trees , right ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there are still six billion trees alone are still six billion trees .
now , you &apos;ve heard something from <unk> from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means we should be more than trees .
and where you can see , even with something like <unk> , the <unk> of agriculture is not allowed to go back .
every year , we lose so three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into that .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re feeling as guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as they all say that our own <unk> go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our environmental footprint footprint , but it &apos;s about what is going to be a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the ultimate , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot yourself , they would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can get rid of our nutrients .
we make in brazil agriculture where we get rid of the nutrients .
in fact , we can put nutrients in this way into agriculture .
we &apos;re doing that in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking the waste of it .
in china , a <unk> is still <unk> , sort of , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always going to be silly , our nutrients .
that is , the whole western <unk> draws out of that town , that the city has always taken only , but the farmers never have a consequence .
and it had to grow the cities growing up more because the farmers were going to go into cities and the cities to keep getting their nutrients away .
all the western empires are still expanding , until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you know , you know , <unk> civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get rid of the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to food , you &apos;re expected to eat that long as long as you get to the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
you &apos;ve invited them to dinner , not for the <unk> .
so that means you can see the internet , you can see the nutrients .
it &apos;s actually nice about , if you do that , agriculture makes a biogas , in a square country , with a hundred thousand country in favelas , you can get a farmer for about <unk> dollars and the facility for you , chickens and pig and vegetables .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in the favelas are about <unk> percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control the people , very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , <unk> , but the plants are carrying themselves .
the <unk> is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to design the design , which is a farmer that can easily grow them .
so that &apos;s called the <unk> coming back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve been built over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these facilities were ever <unk> .
they could just throw a liter of <unk> , and then you would be ruined for the <unk> of it .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people , very little bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to phosphorus <unk> .
and by the way , if you want to do what you do , in germany , they &apos;re at germany , in germany , in <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can do the <unk> of a little help .
because the <unk> facility could be the best phosphorus .
and i need to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we can see it .
we have now used over three years .
the dutch government has explained , they &apos;re going to be the first country around the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need it all over .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there is opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , 40 percent of <unk> control .
and the oil will replace us through other energy .
but the phosphorus is not going to be able to replace .
so it &apos;s not about to make the existing use of a little less bad , but it &apos;s about to do something right .
and it &apos;s especially to ask what &apos;s the right thing .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not to efficiency .
in holland , you understand that of course , because in holland , the land is built on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if for instance , your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;ve got them <unk> , and they come with 50 of us .
very inefficient .
but very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six of three pounds in their life .
this is .
this is not a scientific thing that &apos;s not exactly exactly because we don &apos;t know how much is <unk> .
but a <unk> , even in these lighting , i can tell you , is very inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
it &apos;s beautiful , which is beautiful , not efficient .
it &apos;s not about resource efficiency , but efficiency .
what &apos;s the right ?
not to ask the <unk> nor a little bit better , and it &apos;s going to <unk> it , and in the <unk> world , all of the materials going to lose all the materials for the bottom , but at first time ?
imagine it &apos;s efficient .
yeah ?
if i <unk> them up to dinner and say , there &apos;s a tablet with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you could fall in somebody fall , efficiently ?
yeah ?
that means everything in life , is it &apos;s not about saving to stop .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , oh , you don &apos;t have green green .
no , it &apos;s exactly the right , right ?
everyone in place where you &apos;re <unk> , yes , you get back again .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we think about the north .
there is every footprint .
if you walk , yes , <unk> , every footprint .
because the soil will die the mosses , and the wind and the wind and the water is the floor .
if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water has no longer in the meadow .
so it &apos;s about to create a big footprint , which is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say to sustainability .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
this is just the minimum .
so don &apos;t save the <unk> .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s like , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , like the car , made out of the car .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a <unk> form , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so we &apos;ve developed a <unk> approach , which is in temperature room .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building everywhere .
and they &apos;re seed seeds of rare plants , so they can make it by the way to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two cycles .
not all should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they use it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , the need to be so that they go in biological systems .
the things that &apos;s only used to be used in technical systems .
but today we talk about the biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
all direct ads , for the company , not for the company <unk> per se , but for that they help them now to help these products .
because we don &apos;t make things more free .
yeah ?
so , if i eat them , and say that &apos;s free of <unk> , it doesn &apos;t help you anything .
no , we &apos;re stuck .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic .
it &apos;s all about it , is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> can go into biological loops , right ?
everything about it is <unk> .
and if it comes to us , of course , it &apos;s like , of course , for nike , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry .
and this is half of all the <unk> around the world that caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help you ask for questions for people .
hey , <unk> , are really serious ?
because they &apos;ve been twice the <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure that you &apos;re really <unk> .
so , let me take a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that goes .
we can now make things so that they &apos;re <unk> , if they &apos;re <unk> , you can get into biological cycles .
technical is the same thing .
there &apos;s this one direct <unk> .
this is the first ecological camera , actually , that &apos;s what &apos;s done to go into the circulation .
so you can do that in every store , you can <unk> things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
if the trash is the trash .
all right , this <unk> rum , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
so there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , but in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside that they can go back , you can go back with a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yeah ?
in fact , if you take these these <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , sterile and the powder is to take trees to plant trees .
it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of life for life .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , sort of .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can bring it up again .
i created an institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people there , and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s an extra amount of extra things that can be involved in .
so no longer saving , it &apos;s not saving , it &apos;s not a <unk> , but smart waste .
do it curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that as a <unk> , myself as a <unk> , so in english , i understand .
<unk> are the <unk> notes in <unk> music .
you &apos;re not just a word for word the text into a different language , but the deeper sense of the words and the deeper sense of words and the deeper sense of words that make a reasonable translation .
you can translate into english to the english , more of it , because it &apos;s when you ask it to poetry or anything about poetry .
all of a sudden , it &apos;s for <unk> , which we do musicians with our <unk> .
as a filmmaker , i took the <unk> notes .
you know , you think of the composer in the notes , in the notes , what he thought has thought .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about equally or <unk> , such as a verbal verbal , as a verbal <unk> , the description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers don &apos;t smell to smell the level of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> don &apos;t hear the <unk> of the <unk> .
that is , the <unk> has to be these <unk> description of the <unk> in another , which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
today , i want to show you what i would like to be , like , <unk> , even in a verbal language .
so basically translation translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do it like this whole rather than german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be equivalent to me in translation translation .
so the music works for me as much as the spoken word language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a typeface .
so it &apos;s going to take you to read just reading the notes and the <unk> to the piano or the right place on a <unk> .
this is just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the meaning of the letter is to see if you can &apos;t see the language .
so you need for the process of the music process , at least as long as the word language works at least as long as the word language .
so there &apos;s also <unk> , if you learn it for the <unk> , you know , passively , or you can also talk to you until the musical crowd .
the work of <unk> starts like the one <unk> .
so after you first play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you know , you &apos;re looking at the backgrounds of the composition .
you collects information about the piece of information .
you read in your letter , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from the composers .
you studied the work that he took before and after .
you compare comparison .
the <unk> , writing it .
what does it do ?
how were his lives , like the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all interest me .
you think of yourself in this time by looking at some kind of <unk> pictures or read literature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also got a rich knowledge of the composers of the composers to the composers of the composers that you play more and it falls easier to it , and it falls easier to feel <unk> .
the composer is always going to be more to a friend that lives together .
his cause to write the piece of play is more and more and more to my personal concerns .
because now the notes of all other than a <unk> record of the cause of the <unk> of the composers of the composers , but just a framework , i turn this framework to make it again and meaning meaning .
i &apos;ll tell you my own words , which is between this framework .
i &apos;ll play <unk> , which these sound could mean .
now for me , and for the <unk> , and what you might mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself because i feel , because it comes from my <unk> .
it &apos;s got to me in here and now be <unk> , i can &apos;t convince my audience to that , that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience of the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve spent as long as i &apos;ve spent as long as a result .
as you happy lucky a happy new day , even though the same rituals of life , getting up to the same rituals of life , getting up to their work , so i &apos;ll also be the same thing again .
i &apos;ve become older , i &apos;ve become older , the seasons switch , my pulse goes down to the morning , in a <unk> it takes longer to come back than home .
i &apos;m going to take the <unk> of the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
and all that influences me , and all of these things also affects my experience with the composition .
quite a wonderful thing , if i stand up with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you take a new idea in it , and it &apos;s going to be answered with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things we don &apos;t have <unk> , and what you can &apos;t get samples .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you know , as the audience , how the music is alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like this .
i can &apos;t play today , like 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to therefore on my palette of the <unk> more <unk> , emotions and emotions as today .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;m going to <unk> some <unk> , but it &apos;s new <unk> .
have a nice concrete example .
it was a <unk> for <unk> in my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and a professor of <unk> in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was <unk> , when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , it was very early to meet him with 13 years , and i was in my school high school .
i was at the time 17 when i went to one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four , from the chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of these <unk> was to me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
he <unk> , and he said , this is what ?
this must be the <unk> .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you have a dreams , but no significant memories .
i &apos;ll play it with a couple of years now , and i &apos;ve always changed it for me , even though it doesn &apos;t have a note .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m going to read something new .
for example , an example of a very different one .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , at <unk> light .
he has translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as she saw , as it was .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;m also older than chopin with a chopin with <unk> years ago when he wrote the piece .
he was just <unk> years .
and i think it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even if i mean you can .
to keep <unk> , right by the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start to talk about the language of music music ?
i said yes , you need something like the word language .
often , the <unk> is so that you just learn the notes .
you learn to read virtually this before you just get a word .
you learn how to find the notes on the instrument .
if all of the time they move in the notes and you just like it to move into the notes , then the sound that looks like this together .
when that &apos;s <unk> happens , the student gets the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to talk about the interpretation of the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s the front on the front door , which is a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
loud and <unk> , and b and b , etc .
this is what most of them here .
but even if you put these data , it &apos;s still something technical .
and yet it &apos;s not a matter .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something quite <unk> .
namely , to make music in the instrument that affects your musical and feel before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn , because it didn &apos;t have <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t get <unk> .
it &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to be his own experiences and the idea of music to have the music to make it over another way to make an instrument .
people who have never been singing , they &apos;ve never felt immediately with their own body , how it is to form a note .
an expression of his own breath .
the instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the <unk> in the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make any more even music if it &apos;s boring .
no longer needed to whistle a <unk> or singing .
every single music is <unk> when you &apos;re constantly <unk> by the outside of music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who are saying , yes , but what do you do when i didn &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing them , is a because you think they &apos;re not singing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned , singing ?
so , in either , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t yet , or to learn how to muscles , how to muscles these little muscles that are <unk> .
you can actually train that .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it , they &apos;re <unk> .
so there &apos;s a question of how <unk> could be this diagnosis ?
do you have a <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , like you &apos;re beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want music to do it .
but what i would regret then regret is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you see , you see , all the time you don &apos;t have to be a <unk> .
but don &apos;t say i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
because i &apos;m sorry , but you can tell you whether it &apos;s like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it tastes to me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them , they tell whether it doesn &apos;t taste them .
whether the music is you too <unk> or too sweet .
tell what you feel .
and with the time you get , and you want to get some more spices there , or taste slightly more spices , or taste .
why am i now asking by my audience , that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a artwork that you never look at is not force .
the food that &apos;s being cooked from a chef or a chef <unk> , and not just looked at recipes or recipes .
so please listen to when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if you &apos;re in an environment where the adults are making music or at least <unk> music , a child grows , and then it &apos;s quite easy to ask what color has your flower ?
can you actually play them in blue ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , rather than a <unk> , a blue flower now .
and it sounds very different than before .
and this was the very first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step of a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of life today , which is originally originally a hundred , a <unk> ago ?
now the instruments have been <unk> .
there was a time using bach as an instrument .
it was just not invented .
i think it would have been excited by bach , if he had the <unk> of modern <unk> .
i can now <unk> the <unk> that bach has used to sound on the modern blades , which is a <unk> <unk> .
by beethoven , you know , he was more than he was deaf .
today , modern orchestra is going to be able to play everything , which is an orchestra from the time .
that &apos;s why the composers of us depend on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so you &apos;re going to be able to see what they &apos;ve dreamed of the mind .
and you also think of what &apos;s in the mind .
or what i &apos;m going to do is because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
are you <unk> ?
and how does that feel ?
<unk> .
i have a friend who drive a <unk> .
so when i come , with my little v , i &apos;m <unk> w , and i feel next to this feeling .
i &apos;m going through something through the head .
i &apos;m going to say , <unk> , what do you need that ?
that &apos;s already losing the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i have to afford to do that ?
and then immediately , it &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , this is an awkward feeling .
our organism has been a great way to invent as unpleasant emotions like the horizon .
you can also try to try and words like <unk> or <unk> .
i want to tell you a little bit about this mechanism , or something that you &apos;re probably probably unconscious .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard of when people say , no one has a wall to build a wall .
and then stones <unk> , and he <unk> them .
in fact , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it lets you light <unk> , that he &apos;s completely different .
it &apos;s not just she and not himself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , who has to do with it that they feel themselves .
they need that lie to a <unk> to get a <unk> of a self-deception .
they can be less easy , yes , <unk> , or also to move .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman &apos;s <unk> .
this woman was a <unk> , the portrait you wouldn &apos;t see .
picasso says , wait .
it will always be similar to them .
and at this point , if you laugh , you realize how important is this lie and how much time you need to learn to experience something , which artists are very good at us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
and the artist share with you , and particularly this lady you can &apos;t see , if you just look inside the mirrors .
and the artist gives you a kind of a portrait of something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with , when you look at this kind of artwork .
and then this awkward feeling , you couldn &apos;t see it all the way , and it &apos;ll always be similar to you .
here &apos;s the mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in the arts , too , in the mythology of the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in all the country ?
one day , this mirrors , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you know , as well as a lot of hostility from these things , the mirror can &apos;t lie out of the mirror , from that very true .
but we need to be familiar with that , you know , you can &apos;t tell you a woman somewhere that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere in there .
so here it is necessary to what we understand underwater <unk> , again .
we need to take this a lie that &apos;s going to give us the delusion of <unk> , not that we can &apos;t yet .
we don &apos;t just have the arts , in the <unk> , but also in science that &apos;s great lying .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s lady of <unk> .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of the people .
that should be from the monkey <unk> , and , yes , there &apos;s at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she <unk> her , and she said to her husband and she said , that &apos;s what charles is there .
the person should be from the monkey <unk> or a common ancestors .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it is true , we need to prevent people that people know about this .
why don &apos;t we need to prevent people to know that people know from some time ?
because we can &apos;t live those interventions without life .
because we think of these self-deception , this feeling , great to be great , descent of the highest creatures , not by one of these most <unk> , of such a <unk> of such a organism like an organism that exists in a stone .
so we can &apos;t have these things .
we need to stop that people know that people , especially when they &apos;re true .
and so you can see how slowly this works , and what the tracks look like that it &apos;s leaving to something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a very beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she &apos;s told by a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to think about it because it &apos;s an electrode for <unk> .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m on the firemen .
and because i &apos;m at the time , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re <unk> in this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a person in an moral <unk> , the <unk> is used to the <unk> because we should try to replace it through the future .
you make that once , you know the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the time , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that this is the actual truth .
so a little <unk> that &apos;s not interested in <unk> .
they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no <unk> where we can move around where you learn fire .
there &apos;s just the second second second , just the firemen .
there he was .
and the <unk> , you know , he &apos;s also saying that you &apos;d like to throw it up somewhere else , and i &apos;m excited when the fire after <unk> .
no , it looks like much better when we show that we are in charge of the threats to the dangers , the other one , if you just fire fire .
here &apos;s this little mechanism .
these <unk> that <unk> that in the <unk> knows that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t be loud .
so here you have these <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious of the conscious and the conscious , and it &apos;s not that you can do something about it , and the things that you know is that they look very different from them and others .
so , then just like these words that we &apos;re in the language of the politically politically right time , again .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we &apos;re doing this , the social condition is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s impossible to be these things in a society that works to work .
i want to give you a point of what we found in my institute .
according to the logic , these self-deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than that we actually know that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
i &apos;m going to give you two , maybe we present three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , some of you know , some of you don &apos;t value at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is such a little bit of mental , like leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about <unk> , nature &apos;s physical nature .
and if you have people in front of you who are strong persuasion , or you can also tell you , the belief that they &apos;ve been <unk> by the soul , then imagine that they &apos;ve got a soul of the soul to have a <unk> framework , not from meat and blood , <unk> , yes .
and from this soul , they think that they kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> , in latin america , is present .
and when this <unk> then goes through the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with spirit that can only live , yes .
and then he can just <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we want to them as something like something to be present to our lives .
and if you have that condition , you understand the logic that you see that the logic that we experience is to experience through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> you know from school .
now , this is a <unk> that gives us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
you need a little logic here , but the willingness to lie .
namely , you know , they &apos;re just going to be able to apply this logic .
in this <unk> , three sentences .
the first phrase is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , it &apos;s got no soul .
now there is a third sentence .
i showed him in particular .
the third sentence that immediately refers to the people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who &apos;s not a soul who is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and you feel here .
here is this logic here in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
first of the first two sentences , they &apos;re correct .
i can claim everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make an answer about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i was right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , you &apos;re not a man , not a man .
the logic is not statement about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s going to be .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now the consciousness of consciousness is immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s based on a third sentence , which is nothing to do with the first two sentences and the way that the opposite of the first sentence has been proven to be proven and <unk> .
because we actually have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it &apos;s easy to use two sentences that are correct , and a third of <unk> that looks like it would have to do with so that we can save our <unk> .
so we &apos;re doing that as though it was actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can keep these things in different ways .
so in the present , we have a very modern illustration , which is always the <unk> .
now , this is going to have to be another <unk> topic , a <unk> from the philosophy of philosophy .
so that &apos;s what we go back to the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> scholars called johannes <unk> , and after that is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is made of pure nature .
this is not the soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you place the exact in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do it first .
so he stands in the middle .
this is the <unk> probe .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , so if you can imagine that a little bit bigger power , it doesn &apos;t have reason and nothing .
automatically goes to the right thought .
if you have this idea , you know , in nature &apos;s way , you &apos;re being driven by being driven by the larger crowd that you &apos;re going to put a straight , then you have to feel quickly that there will be something like a free of will .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> , i remember the <unk> <unk> of brain brain .
there is a <unk> , who is called the wolf <unk> , and he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> , claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now , we can form the second sentence , and we can tell the <unk> <unk> right , then he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read about every day in the morning , this is what you find in this third sentence .
this looks like this , who has no <unk> , cannot be for his actions and claims for responsibility , and he &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , it &apos;s again .
in fact , you have to prove if there &apos;s something like that kind of <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to pretend to do that , as if the first sentence was wrong , you &apos;d like to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything , if you want to do anything , if you want yourself to test yourself , and particularly if you want to make people happy , this courage to lie .
practice , for example , if you meet a person who you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please use the german word word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
they won &apos;t call them , that would be a little politically politically <unk> .
they say there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately they &apos;re going to be one of the things that you &apos;ve been there , you know , you know , you can &apos;t prove it .
and you have a problem .
because it &apos;s while they &apos;re busy making themselves that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s misled .
because he &apos;s got it on a <unk> , he doesn &apos;t get it down himself .
because it &apos;s actually not prove to prove .
he &apos;s just interested in himself to be able to prove himself to prove themselves that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the way , in the way of the shift in the <unk> experience is the <unk> of the lie .
and once again , once you have an opportunity to feel these <unk> in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy if they &apos;re happy in this way to remember their <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to ask myself , if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here , and i asked me if i wanted to take a talk here , and my idea is to give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve been <unk> it , it was hard to talk to me .
and i may have a <unk> , maybe i &apos;m going to try to introduce you .
but of course , the sum is very , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably probably one of these are the two girls who are still there , i &apos;m probably probably one of the generation that this is <unk> for the bad <unk> image of the <unk> , because i think , today , i think of <unk> .
and i got me in the &apos; 80s of the &apos; 80s , after berlin , because i wanted to leave renewables , and there &apos;s not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> was all the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re called the hot world today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or <unk> .
but it &apos;s like this , like <unk> , from a little square watts of the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , it was a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m the <unk> grateful that he had the word again again , because after the <unk> they didn &apos;t get the word word , because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the 1930s .
because it was like that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you &apos;d think evil .
the place of <unk> , but it was called <unk> and the solar and the solar system , and i started the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;m saying was , very , very , very , very , very , because many , many beautiful expressions were that i have lived through .
i &apos;ve been working for 11 years in the collective , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if you haven &apos;t been told the <unk> , the <unk> , which has an entirely <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a 10 years , if i was a <unk> thing , if i could really <unk> my father <unk> , you &apos;ve really got the money on the window .
it &apos;s related to insanity .
and it was really very , very , very , very , very , very <unk> , and then you get into such a phase in the <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a picture of <unk> , where i asked for 10 years , a thousand <unk> was that we were supposed to be the great thing .
and then i went to <unk> , and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> of the company , <unk> of the company , which was <unk> together with the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s largest <unk> in the world .
a <unk> , but we have a course of course , of course , the problem of a growing company , and we then <unk> , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going back and go back and go to the next topic , that people think , what &apos;s the <unk> of the future .
and i &apos;ve brought you a project i want to you now .
and the title of my presentation was how you get into a hundred percent .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , where could you make a more abstract history in it .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s a couple thousand thousand people .
they have a renewables from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
this is just technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> , the system starts to fail .
and i &apos;m always telling you the politicians , when they &apos;re in <unk> our facility .
they always say why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent and seven percent , and our web is the same european .
if we had 20 percent of europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on the island of this island .
and the question was simple , it was <unk> , first of the first head of the island of the island , <unk> .
how big would you have to be a battery that &apos;s going to be a battery in 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back again .
the conventional system looks like this all the way around the world .
by the way , a year , about a hundred <unk> electrical performance on the world .
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear nuclear power , because it &apos;s pretty fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world is going to be accompanied with diesel because you don &apos;t need it .
it &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re like a box .
and then it looks like this .
they &apos;re always three of the <unk> , two are always waiting for two .
yeah , this is what you see is the burden .
we also have very detailed data .
and the <unk> , or whatever it is , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or or a system , which is only in small amounts .
our goal was just to say , okay .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> and the wind , the sun , the burden of the load , that they can map the wider percentage of map .
and if you want to take over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , is not the performance of the performance , then you have to turn the <unk> off .
that means , at the moment , they need to worry that the renewable renewable energy can take all the network .
and you can only do that , of course , if you &apos;re a kind of kind of , in some way .
so this has no one on the world .
now , there &apos;s a little bit of the little style , so you can also get your car <unk> on a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what &apos;s going on in <unk> , because in <unk> ?
it &apos;s already .
but if you want to get tens of thousands of these <unk> , and they &apos;re supposed to build a network , it becomes extremely complicated .
and the goal was , we wanted to go to 70 to the end of the world , and then there &apos;s the rest of the rest of the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent is very , very expensive and it won &apos;t work .
it &apos;s going to be an energy of an energy , which is , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , that will be it .
they need to look at a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what is a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then a whole bunch of simulation did .
and the wind and the sun and the load of <unk> and came to the outcome , a very exciting outcome , because 20 years is a <unk> outcome of about 50 cents per <unk> .
these were the first calculations calculations about six years .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper , like the <unk> , if the average rate five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would happen to be done ?
have helped investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
and we were only used to five people to build a society .
and here &apos;s another picture .
the brown is the conventional system , the green system , is our system .
that our system has been a <unk> , is because we &apos;re still 20 percent of <unk> , and it &apos;s also a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that &apos;s on the island of the island , has said , this is what we find .
and we want to support , but we don &apos;t think that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we have chosen to build a hall to build a hall where we sort of like the electric <unk> of the island of the island to three things exactly .
this is what we &apos;ve been looking for looking for the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from from asia , in the fall of japan .
and <unk> is her in the &apos; 70s , at the &apos; 70s , at the &apos; 70s , and then became developed in the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of power , and it can bring six hours long to this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they did .
and we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , like it stands into the hall in the hall to actually the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s going to be like the <unk> , here &apos;s the whole thing that &apos;s in the back here .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate all the <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to the sort of <unk> of the web .
and you can see this again again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> onto the net net .
so here we see here again , again , again , again , again , the <unk> , individual <unk> .
and what we &apos;ve done since the <unk> was the hall that was done , until now , basically everything &apos;s been between the single system of electronics , in software , software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the top battery and the net network and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate the web to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing about the theme of that island is that you &apos;ve been able to solve everything that &apos;s <unk> on problems that we &apos;re going to get when we increase our sources of renewables .
so this whole discussion of how is going to go back at the moment and <unk> , <unk> , like this , on the island , for example , for example , for example , is the wind and the sun <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start on the island of the island to integrate the <unk> , <unk> , you can cause the load .
so , if you &apos;re at 70 percent , you don &apos;t get that without memory .
you can <unk> through the n of <unk> , you can , yes , you should fall in whatever you do , the percentage of <unk> , but you will never get on memory completely .
and that &apos;s the n of a little bit .
and so many people come and look at that there , because you can see what &apos;s problems you get .
when we turn off soils , then you have no more sophisticated mass , which is a kind of inertia in the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically <unk> masses of big <unk> , wherever the wave around all around the world around europe .
we &apos;re looking at this web , which is the <unk> of 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to <unk> nine times nine , we &apos;re going to start a little <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;ll move again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly high .
if you <unk> it , it takes a little while .
this <unk> <unk> has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this spinning mass , and then you have to replace the <unk> and <unk> .
and we can two big battery in two milliseconds .
there &apos;s already , you know , there &apos;s enormous <unk> there .
and the message is , we need to get to this rotating mass of <unk> , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on .
then we need to break our <unk> capacity to the net .
<unk> is simply simply running the power power to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> moment at the moment , <unk> , <unk> , because we don &apos;t have , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make the capacity for the <unk> capacity to break down the <unk> capacity to the net .
and there are also a lot of studies now .
and to that purpose , people come up and look at our <unk> , sort of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get there a piece of a way .
and many discussions that i had spent in the last six years , like the discussion i &apos;ve been in the last 30 years on the theme of the last 30 years .
isn &apos;t it , there &apos;s no ear , <unk> , we &apos;ve never seen anything .
we have 30 <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to go out of the next 30 or the same capacity for the next 30 years , the same capacity will be .
it &apos;s just like this .
there &apos;s a whole bunch of <unk> there and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years now that the scientists are on my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million prescriptions of <unk> , and also to <unk> <unk> now on the german web .
this will happen in the next april .
so , from that , you know , there &apos;s a change in this change , and it &apos;s just from this <unk> to the idea , and a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so we &apos;ve always been trying to do all the arguments in arguments , these <unk> , who are <unk> , they have a very small web , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is simply , if you &apos;re totally independent , from some of the fossil fuels , or <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> in the world , and they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re an island .
then you use what the sun and the wind is there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision by a <unk> and i &apos;m grateful for you to have said that they have said .
and this is what we do , and this is the way we &apos;re going to come in this talk from <unk> <unk> , that you can get back to a collective and solar energy , a little bit together .
and yeah , i want you to just encourage you , in the senses , you can be a little bit crazy and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , in fact , in the los angeles times , she went through the streets of los angeles , one day was a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless on a violin , who was just two strings .
many of you will know the story of the story , because of <unk> articles , a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> junior , with robert <unk> junior , with robert <unk> <unk> , the <unk> who went through his <unk> and his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he was living on the streets of <unk> row at the center of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all the way to read the reading book , or to look at the film , so they &apos;re not just the wonderful connection that between these two men , but also how it was the music that helped make the <unk> , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , to walt disney <unk> hall .
he was just a clip of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and she came behind the stage to imagine .
he was speaking in a very <unk> and <unk> note about shame , and hillary clinton and how the dodgers dodgers would never be able to do the baseball world would create the last sentence from beethoven &apos;s 2008 .
we went to talk music to music , and a few days later , i got an email that nathaniel himself was interested in <unk> in me .
i still have to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already filled with electrical electric and <unk> and raised a trauma , a trauma that had his whole life .
and as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenics , which are particularly vulnerable , and it &apos;s sometimes bad , and he would stop in the streets of <unk> row , always the horror and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in fact , in fact , nathaniel <unk> was nathaniel when we started to disney disney hall to the walt disney hall , and he had started this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and didn &apos;t lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and smoke as he wanted to poison in his hands .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was scared that i could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and i would destroy him to the scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i started to play .
i played the first sentence of beethoven <unk> .
and while i was played out , i realized that in <unk> eyes was a complete shift .
it was , as if it was a <unk> impact , a chemical reaction to the impact of my game .
<unk> <unk> anger in understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and i began to play some of some clips of <unk> and asked me to play them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , started by bach over beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge about music owned , but it was a very tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i &apos;d like to my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by having music played and talked about music , it was from this <unk> , confused man who had taken away from the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music changes .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to be able to think of his thoughts and delusions with help of his imagination and creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is exactly what &apos;s the nature of art .
so this is the reason why we do music : we can do something that in all of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity for reality .
and the reality of that speech is all of us , and moved all together and move together .
in nathaniel , the music brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him in a family of musicians who recognized his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m always going to talk about nathaniel music in the walt disney <unk> hall or <unk> row , because it reminds me why i was a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i &apos;d like to do that i stole the <unk> .
i hope you pardon me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good gentle , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what &apos;s a fish .
even better , he was convicted of <unk> after the best standards standards of sustainability .
you could probably feel about it .
i had this one relationship with several months .
one day , the head called the head of the company , and asked if i could give you an event , over the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
so here was a company that was trying to solve what this is a problem for our chefs . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans as we &apos;ve been burnt <unk> .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , probably or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of arguments about it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
this is , 15 lbs of <unk> , you need to get a <unk> <unk> .
not very sustainable .
doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , a company who was trying to do it right .
i wanted them to be supported .
on day before the event , i phoned the ceo of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call it .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; don &apos;t worry about the facts right , you &apos;re famous for this to grow out of the sea , they &apos;re famous in the sea , they don &apos;t <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out of the waste of our fish being distributed from our fish . &quot;
and then he added to , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
the <unk> of <unk> came to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what do you do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what is a sustainable protein ?
so i phoned the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t know .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t matter what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know he . he &apos;ll just ask .
well , i &apos;m a <unk> with a few people in the company . no one could give me an answer to me , until i finally biologists .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; don &apos;t you say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , he &apos;s <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , alcohol , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in fact , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t think what is sustainable to fish , chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i got <unk> in fact of this fish , because , i swear to god , the guy after this entertainment chicken has gone .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the way you know better your fish , you know the fish .
i went to a restaurant first in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came on the table with a bright , <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
stop twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste so well , after he &apos;s got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . it &apos;s actually called <unk> .
and no , he has not cooked the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the stream .
the farm was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> on what the wetlands were .
they made it by the country .
they built this complicated episode of these complicated , and it absorbs the water from the land , and there &apos;s the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that work , not economically .
and it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what are many birds .
and this is how spanish a spanish company has bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow flow of the water .
they &apos;re literally <unk> the levers .
instead of the water , they used to use these channels to <unk> water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a million square miles of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company the ecological destruction completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something else .
they stare out on the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and all you see these are <unk> channels and these dense density .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three and three of charles darwin and a piece of &quot; a crocodile . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and fought us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> <unk> .
this is a rare <unk> <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here he sees a pattern of <unk> , which is the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has the greatest part of his career national national park in africa .
i asked him how he became so a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes away and covered in <unk> birds of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , like this .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was , and my head was a <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had .
so i cut it off . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it come as well that your fish are so good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that eat fish , what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
later on day , i went on this site with <unk> around the day , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that &apos;s so , &quot; unlike every farm i had ever been , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
at the moment , it was as if a director would have a <unk> .
and we took around the road , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of <unk> , a literally carpet carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t <unk> her fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> the birds .
well , last year , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one today , and one of the most important of the most important of the most important , in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> <unk> of the last thing you &apos;d like to do on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not hard .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the clash is better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s <unk> the <unk> . a farm that &apos;s not fed up , and a farm that affects their success in the health .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , these <unk> don &apos;t even be there by the beginning .
they breed in a city for 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , they &apos;re going to go 240 miles to farm every morning .
and every night , they &apos;re going to go 240 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , we &apos;re going to go 240 miles of the farm and you &apos;re going to go next kilometers back at night ?
do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me , as i was just a <unk> of whitney at the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . they &apos;re doing it because it &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , who was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m never going to <unk> almost .
and yet , when i try to do it in this restaurant in <unk> , you didn &apos;t have to be <unk> .
she liked so sweet and it would take a chunk of the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> and <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last <unk> before something something in the body .
she has evolved in the evolution of the evolution of <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feeds her fish . a farm that affects their success in their predators .
and then i realized when he says a farm that has no <unk> , <unk> <unk> , because the water that &apos;s flowing through this farm comes from the stream in the stream .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to lead all the things that rivers tend to tend to take them with themselves , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it was working through the system , and this leaves the water , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm that feed her animals , not just a farm that affects their success , but a farm that &apos;s literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but it &apos;s not just for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should also do that , because these love , like , <unk> , like <unk> .
you could say that it is a recipe for the future of good foods , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
so what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , which is actually good .
but for many people &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat food .
and if you say that these things are the things that the future is good at the future , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> , but how will they feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve been enough calories to produce enough to feed the world .
one billion people will become hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because it &apos;s the logic of our <unk> last 50 years .
the grain of herbivores , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken fish on the earth , chicken fish , and the whole time has simply grown up the arguments simply : &quot; if we &apos;re more people cheaper .
this was the cause . it was the easy . it was the business of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , an industrial industry in <unk> , an industry that &apos;s fast <unk> capital , which is that this production allows .
this is not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is not threatened by <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile country , not through pumps land , but through fresh water , not by pumps , and not by <unk> water , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that have every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> of the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are standing in there , and it never made a little good to eat .
so let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses , which are not the worlds for themselves , we are <unk> , including <unk> , <unk> , businesses , <unk> , farmers who are not just <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts who are experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be honest .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
now , if i want to you today , it is that the data of the data that we consume , greater than the sum of the data that we consume , as opposed to <unk> , i want you to think about how we can use information that would otherwise not be visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> age after age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain amount of death , say we &apos;re accidents .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because there &apos;s the people who are most active and they are over here .
we can take a step further out and see the data and see the data then and see that <unk> and cancer , are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we look at age , and after age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents even is the key thing to make people worry about .
and lo and behold , this is particularly true in men .
so what you see is that this is from information and data in this way in this way in a living <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not even for content ?
so what we &apos;ve now got here is the <unk> , &quot; sport <unk> , &quot; which has ever been detected .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk to the <unk> .
with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
they can dive into a particular year .
you can get directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this game and the <unk> .
so i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;m going to get there , i &apos;m going to show you all of a sudden when i &apos;m mentioned armstrong .
now , if i want to have a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all the theme of the theme of what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and <unk> .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> <unk> , wider , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t think or not just <unk> .
you make something which is actually slightly different .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it &apos;s changing the way information .
so i want to do this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
so what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> , and it &apos;s a little summary .
the summary is a quick <unk> and a symbol for the domain of it .
i &apos;ll just give the top 500 of the top .
but even in that , we can see a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the topics that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote the issue .
well , after i chose to &apos; government , i know that the <unk> <unk> , most of the time , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
so this is really important , because this is an insight that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you look back and look at this .
i can see a certain of these summaries , i can then <unk> the theme of time , &quot; people of the year , and everyone together .
now , if i look at all these guys , i see that the majority of these guys are <unk> , some of the science come from science . some , even less , coming out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono also is a ted prize .
so we can jump and take a look at all the ted prize .
you can see , we &apos;re <unk> the first time as though it &apos;s really a net , not just from side to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what could be a little surprise .
i &apos;ll show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at the websites that -- and we bring them to each individual website like this .
so i can go back to a step back and stare directly at a specific <unk> .
so that &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you &apos;re just looking through this websites in this kind of websites in this way , and in the way , all the <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in my process in a particular time in a certain time .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been held up to here .
and i can &apos;t have anything that i looked at today , again .
and when i turn back a step , and i can look at all the way , i can imagine my new york column maybe after my favorite <unk> . here , i &apos;ve been looking for <unk> , right here , or here , in <unk> , or here .
and from here , i can go into the site and you &apos;re going to call them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over again , and every time it does , it &apos;s going to be greater than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> in information .
what if we could turn this situation , and the internet is upside down , so that instead of being able to go from one to another , i can go from one to many things , and some patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , then these <unk> will be <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and instead , instead of just moving into information , we can know that .
and if we can experience , we can even pull out , we can even pull out .
so i hear that , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school , every day an hour , an hour .
and my nose always had always been in a book , a <unk> , which is my thought in other worlds , and in a <unk> way , my <unk> in <unk> , voracious curiosity .
and this kind of curiosity showed me that i didn &apos;t always work if i was in school through the forests of the forests , and the samples of &quot; collected , frogs , frogs and snakes and snakes and bugs and under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always trying to understand the world to understand the world and explore the limits of the potential .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be like in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explore the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living rooms with his amazing shows where animals and places and a world full of wonder showed that we could never have imagined before .
and i think that &apos;s all right at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there &apos;s no video video games , i &apos;ve got the whole <unk> with <unk> movies that i had to make the pictures in my head .
we had to all the time . when we read as a children , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> them on the screen .
my response to that was the drawing and painting of aliens , alien robots , robots , <unk> and all the way .
in the <unk> , i was constantly reading by the teacher , like i hidden in the textbook .
the creativity needed to hold out .
and what happened was something interesting . what was inspired by jacques <unk> shows , was the thought of an unknown world here on our planet .
certainly , i would never make a alien world a alien world . it seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk in , here on earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic as all the things that i &apos;ve been imagined was when i read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i decided to be .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally got a <unk> in buffalo in buffalo , new york , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
the ocean , but a real ocean , i got two years later on my face to face california .
since the 40 years , there are now <unk> , i have about three thousand hours of water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , as a rich oceans , as rich as we really can &apos;t imagine .
the minds of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
until for the day , i feel the deepest awe for what i see in my dives .
and my love for the ocean stops , with the same intensity as ever .
when i was an adult <unk> , it was the filmmaking .
it seemed the best way to get my inner desire to tell stories with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew books all the time .
so , movies of the way , images and stories bring together . that they started .
of course , the stories that i <unk> myself from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so , in these two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; to be a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we took <unk> animation , <unk> , back to <unk> animation , back .
so what came out was the first <unk> <unk> ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t take a money , right , exactly he was going to play it , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was how <unk> the magic that was <unk> .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law is <unk> technology and magic technology and magic .
so you saw something magic .
and i found incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what you need to be in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went into &quot; terminator , &quot; my next film , even a lot .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success depended on it .
and it worked . again , we had something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we have a little bit more money on the movie .
from those two experiences , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , and with my good friend , <unk> <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so the basic idea of this company was able to create the phase of analog processes with visual printers and the same with digital <unk> .
so that &apos;s what we did , and then we have an advantage for us .
but in the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- which we had created the company in which we had started to slow down .
i had this piece called the avatar , &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the equivalent of putting in some visual effects and <unk> effects in new altitudes , with endless human , expressive characters that had been made by <unk> .
but the bar , it took a nice back , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to do <unk> .
so i took this and made this other film about the big ship that goes into .
the <unk> i made this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became a <unk> of magnitude of magnitude , a very keen film .
but in fact , i wanted to really wanted to the real <unk> of the titanic .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know it .
i persuaded them , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re diving up to the <unk> . we &apos;re film that &apos;s real .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
it &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good marketing marketing marketing .
and i persuaded them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is what it goes back to it , that can be a reality .
and we actually created a six months later , a reality that i <unk> myself in a russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the actual titanic .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so that &apos;s really my head .
and the way to work was enormous . we had to put cameras and <unk> and <unk> and all kinds of things .
and i fell on , like very , very , very , very these <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and more sophisticated planning planning .
you go up in those capsule , then you &apos;re floating into these dark , <unk> environments where no hope is to rescue a hope .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like me in a <unk> .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , part of the part of curiosity and science has to do . it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a character that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t see what i could see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i haven &apos;t seen before , sometimes things that had seen before no one had seen before , and the science at the time we saw them .
so that &apos;s got me right away , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met something unusual .
after success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on hollywood on the ice , and i &apos;m going to <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we went to the <unk> <unk> , and they explored with <unk> .
we went to the wreckage of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was <unk> and the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody had ever explored the inside of the <unk> , and you had no means of it . so we developed the technology .
now , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see the <unk> that these <unk> are quite similar , and i know that once the band is quite similar , and i know that once the band is played .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the spine of the ship .
i &apos;m not <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner , i always know what was in the <unk> of the vehicle in the vehicle , since we did the film .
the set was an exact copy of the performance of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me <unk> that you use such a <unk> <unk> , and so consciousness in the vehicle , in the vehicle , in the other form of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something or explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> , i can think of myself as a <unk> .
after that , we began to really appreciate what we saw at the bottom of the bottom , really , for example , these amazing animals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . this is like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight , how we do that .
and so you can see the animals right next to 500 degrees celsius they can survive .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> again from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who care about space and nasa , and in <unk> , and real estate planning : you go to russia , through the mission of the <unk> protocol , they go to russia , they &apos;re going through and <unk> our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took <unk> with us in the deep sea .
i took them with and <unk> them access to the world : <unk> , <unk> , people who are interested in such extreme extreme situations , and i took them to take samples and instruments and instruments . so on .
and we made it , but in fact , but science , but actually , i was <unk> .
so the one circle between my own existence as a child , at the time , as a child , and the implementation in the reality .
in the course of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot of learning .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science . but i &apos;m certainly thinking you can also have a director to get a leader like a <unk> or so .
but i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i before these expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t bring us cash .
we &apos;re going to take the cost of a time . of fame .
all the way i was between &quot; the titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; <unk> , and i &apos;d put it somewhere on a row on the beach .
i &apos;ve got all these films , these <unk> , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the job of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most important environment that there are . you &apos;re doing it because of the <unk> connection that comes out when a small group of people have a team .
because we have only 10 to 12 people working for years that have been working for years , sometimes we were two to three months in a row at sea .
and in this community , you see the most important thing that you have in front of each other is the most important thing that you have before , because you have a problem that you can &apos;t .
if you go back to the country and says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all around it , the human <unk> , if you &apos;re working on the air , and the difficulty that &apos;s working on the sea , you can &apos;t explain it .
there &apos;s a connection that comes with each other .
so when i came back to the next film , my next film called &quot; avatar , &quot; i was trying to use the same leadership , which is that it &apos;s got to be respected in return of the respect .
it &apos;s got the dynamic really changes .
so there was a little team over the <unk> terrain , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been there before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we &apos;ve been at a time of four and a half years ago .
and it changed my way to make films , completely .
there were people who thought we had these <unk> really <unk> and on the planet .
for me , it was more like a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all that ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think about the first time , curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of the team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me an advice , like i can . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you own yourself .
you know , it &apos;s going to be different for you . don &apos;t do yourself , you don &apos;t pay yourself for yourself . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in the arts and you study it has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
not very important endeavor , for innovation , became no risk of risk .
you need to be willing to take those risks .
so that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way , failure is absolutely an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
and this is surprising to maybe because of my <unk> , mainly in the foundation of the foundation around the foundation of vaccines and seed seed , and the things that we invent and deliver the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually actually more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over a lot of years , and it &apos;s too much . the things will change the way it can &apos;t be able to withstand it .
it leads to the <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to me .
so , is an climate change for you .
the other thing is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of one thing , the <unk> would be energy by far energy .
well , the <unk> is over time .
in fact , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> opened the industrial revolution , and even in the twentieth century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> and therefore we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s meet the price of half -- we &apos;re going to meet a new barrier , and this barrier is flowing together .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear .
it &apos;s <unk> that <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the <unk> episode that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t evolve and so whole systems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where others are follow , there are some <unk> , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certain ambiguity of how bad these are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we don &apos;t have to go down to close to zero ?
you don &apos;t have half a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : we &apos;re going to close close to the temperature , the temperature will continue .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than to say , we &apos;ve got a little <unk> truck who has to bridge under one of three feet to bridge , and then you can actually put it underneath it .
this one has got to lower , right down .
well , we put a lot of carbon from over a year , about 70 billion tons .
every single american metric about 20 tons of people , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to produce changes that are going down .
it &apos;s all up .
only different economic changes have been influenced at all the time , and we need to go from <unk> increase , and we need to be a reduction in <unk> .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little multiplication . you &apos;ve got this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to be the number of people depend on the <unk> of the service that every person in the average uses of the service that every person is using .
so let &apos;s just look at each one &apos;s time , and let &apos;s think about how we get it .
probably one of those numbers need very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
we first have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it &apos;s going to spend on nine billion points to move over to nine billion cars .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are , we could probably reduce 10 percent to 15 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we can see it .
the second factor are the services that we use .
it &apos;s all the foods that we eat eating clothing , clothing , television heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means to make these services almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
in the rich world , in the upper billion billion , we could make it <unk> , and less , but on average , that number of each year increases this number of year , the number of services will be placed in the services per year .
here we can see a very basic service . there &apos;s home at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in terms of efficiency , the energy service , the energy service service service , there is finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
because of different successes in <unk> , by other <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods in the <unk> , there are many services to their energy .
in other service , like the process of <unk> , 65 bc : <unk> <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; <unk> or the <unk> , it &apos;s very much smaller .
in fact , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might have a reduction in order for a factor of three or maybe even a factor .
but the first three factors , we &apos;re now going to go from 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion tons of tons . and that &apos;s simply not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key to co2 -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going on an energy per unit .
it begs the question , if you can get that .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every <unk> of electricity <unk> nowadays , carbon dioxide , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term , i &apos;m using the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer &apos;s computer is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of a lot of these miracles .
i don &apos;t usually have a deadline for a given to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just wrong , and some of them are not , other ones .
in this case , we need to be <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really get to ?
there is a natural <unk> , a demonstration which is the idea of people here ?
i remember about last year when i was killing the mosquitoes and kind of liked the people .
the idea was really , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i noticed this one .
i decided that that would take out of the time , my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . you &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get much much .
we need solutions , either , or a half or a half of scale , and vast <unk> , and although there are many directions that people are looking for looking for , i can just see five that big demands .
i have the tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
and this might be a <unk> piece of contribution and if you can do better than i expect , it would be great , but my graph here is that we need to give them all those five work , and we can &apos;t give them from them because they all have significant problems .
so let &apos;s look at the first fossil fuels , burning fossil fuels from either coal or natural gas .
what you need to do is , maybe it may seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to get rid of all the co2 , which is , after burning , under pressure , and hope somewhere and hope .
there are a couple of <unk> that &apos;s going to be on 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very hard to get very hard . and it &apos;s a <unk> problem for the cost of the co2 .
who will make it make sure ?
who literally can guarantee what &apos;s literally a lot of billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can feel from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot .
so that &apos;s a hard problem .
next : <unk> .
it also has three big problems . the cost , particularly in <unk> countries are up high . the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human being <unk> .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s what you might work with .
the last three of the five is i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
the density is the density that these technologies are generating dramatically decrease as the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more than a normal power station .
and also , these vent <unk> <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day and the wind doesn &apos;t always <unk> the wind .
so you have to be , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have a way of the energy that &apos;s even available in times when they &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission of transmission . if we say that the power is the energy outside the country , not only the technology , you have to deal with the risk of energy where the energy comes from where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all made these kinds of batteries that will be made , look at the cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything , and i found that every batteries that we produce less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be 100 to 100 better than a factor of being 100 better than the opportunity .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these <unk> sources of sources of new sources of the rest of 20 percent .
if you want to rely on 100 percent , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project ? how do we get to ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , they &apos;re saying , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of ted in the ted group that are already engaged there .
bill has several companies for several companies , including one called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies making great stuff and interesting opportunities and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;m funding a company , which , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach is .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> .
the development has stopped in this industry , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never make any reasonable if it was going to work , but there is modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the <unk> is much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as <unk> .
instead of getting it to the head , you &apos;ll burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
so this is going to take some louder , a bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column as a &quot; <unk> wave . &quot;
it &apos;s really the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that &apos;s 99 percent ; you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s burned down today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
the <unk> earthquake for hundreds of years .
and if you get <unk> , you get enough propellant , you get enough propellant for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s lots of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we measure our success .
what should we look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot from one 80 percent reduction in 2050 by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be generated in poor countries , and there &apos;s still agriculture , hopefully <unk> and cement .
so to get these 80 percent , the developed developed , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note , if we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , if you &apos;re in all developed countries , if you &apos;re in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is a key feature of this <unk> .
if we go back from here , what should determine the 2020 ?
it should contain the two elements .
we need to use the <unk> use to get reduction in the way to get to the way , the less we &apos;re going to be less <unk> , the <unk> , and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re not going to do is not going to lead to the big <unk> , just the same , or even something less important than the other ones that are the <unk> of innovation .
we need these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the election , &quot; and david <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through and creating a framework that &apos;s been going to be discussing the way , because we need to need for all sides .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of this wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig in between long and in the long term , people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and nearly all live in those two billion are very much bad .
so what do we need to do ?
what do things do me ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they &apos;re not only talking about carbon .
they were supposed to talk about these arguments , and they would be shocked by the <unk> of the <unk> of this innovative way .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; d is something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the news .
we need to be dialogue , and we need a lot of things that &apos;s going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- you know , you can give you an idea of magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : in order to perform the simulation on a supercomputer , all big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need some 10 million , and even if we have our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure to make sure that it works .
so the hard step is building the first <unk> , another billion , the <unk> and the place of actually the first one to build the first one .
as soon as the first is done , if it &apos;s like promised , it &apos;s all clear because the economic density is so different , because the profit density is so different as the <unk> , as we know .
so to the right thing to understand that that means deep in the ground is almost like a vertical column <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , and then the process starts , and it &apos;s going to work on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . now you have to <unk> the reactor forever , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it and things <unk> or <unk> . that &apos;s not good !
if you have a very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you think of a column that she bury , without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and <unk> 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which is a solution for the <unk> .
<unk> : yeah . now what happens to the waste : you can sit in the seats -- there &apos;s a lot less trash with this technique -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that &apos;s already there that exists in these <unk> or <unk> in these reactors . this is our <unk> .
so this reactors , which is a problem for these reactors , what we &apos;re doing in our lab and it will dramatically reduce dramatically .
but while you &apos;ve talked about different people around the world .
where is the biggest interest in what really does ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t set ourselves into a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of interest and people in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here and talked about how to fit this .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese did have something in the direction .
this is another one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a <unk> reactor , and some countries have this built , so everyone that has done a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your mind , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to really call this life in life ?
<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , and then we have 20 years to <unk> and then 20 years .
so this is sort of the deadline that we need to see the <unk> has demonstrated that we need .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies , the same thing , if we work together , it can work for the work that will work for their pilots .
and it would be best when it comes to several , because then you could use a blend .
in every case , we need a solution .
the great thing about breakthroughs is this is the biggest thing that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important .
it would be without the <unk> , but it &apos;s still so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how much as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> , which is a little bit hard , but maybe they &apos;re saying that it &apos;s about us .
and so , there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing about it is that a <unk> one million times so much of energy has so much energy , we say , if you can deal with the problems , and these are mostly the radiation , which is the effect on the country and other things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to be <unk> , to try to make the stable stable , which is robust ?
<unk> : if you come to this situation , it &apos;s like you too much ate too much , and you &apos;re short in a heart attack . what do you do ? you need a <unk> or something like that .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is <unk> with various techniques to <unk> the warming , so we 20 years or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you should not just work on insurance because you might be lazy to the insurance because you know , because you know that one will save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you get the importance of this problem in front of your problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in <unk> , whether you can get things faster , if things can come faster than we expect .
<unk> : have a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you tell that there &apos;s negative effects that we have to do with the clouds that are going to move things ?
so there &apos;s very , very few things that you can tell at all of you , from which there is a chance in a million .
so the <unk> here is like aids .
you make the error now , and you pay for a lot of it .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of problems , you &apos;ve got to invest in something that you &apos;ve got to invest in , and this is that the investment doesn &apos;t necessarily realize that the investment doesn &apos;t necessarily realize the worst scenario and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that when you can make it , and the co2 goes down , they also say the <unk> : &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter that it was no co2 , i &apos;d wish it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> &apos;s argument that if you use all of these time and energy that &apos;s used to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals of the suffering , all the other goals are suffering and so forth , that &apos;s what we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending is spending 10 billion a year more than the research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year than you do today .
they shouldn &apos;t suffer from other things .
so you go to big <unk> , and there &apos;s a reasonable people can disagree with if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to finance it . &quot;
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in a <unk> and <unk> just the learning curve , and i think we should do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the <unk> you get , is a very high <unk> , you can only keep the wealthy .
i mean , each of us here could be five times so much for our energy spend without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why are the research going on ? &quot;
it &apos;s still still because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group , and therefore he does it now .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think for appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , it &apos;s just nuts .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk for almost all the people here when i say , i &apos;m hoping that your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty easy . <unk> is to the largest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about <unk> <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and even though it looks really easy , it &apos;s actually hard because it &apos;s people working very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a <unk> .
it was a big success .
since i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world with students , engineers and architects , architects and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and there &apos;s something about that , which is very profound , and i want to share some of them with you .
usually the most people start to knit themselves to the problem .
they talk about it , they think what it is going to look like , they &apos;re <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and an organization . she loves spaghetti sauce .
they invest in a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> structure .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , take the marshmallow , and you put it on top of the top , step back and put it on the top , step back and <unk> .
but what &apos;s going on , almost , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is doing that the whole thing , and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more <unk> than others , and under the worst , <unk> <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re really <unk> .
and of course , of course , there is a lot more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and under the best , <unk> student <unk> .
and this is quite amazing .
like peter , they &apos;re not just the top towers towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , what is that ? why ? why ? what ?
and peter tells me , &quot; none of the kids spend a lot of time to the spaghetti sauce of the spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;ve been trained to find the right plan , ok .
and it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
so what &apos;s going to do is that they start with the marshmallow and prototypes and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they would allow the opportunity to fix .
<unk> recognize these kinds of cooperation as a result of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get instant feedback and what &apos;s not going to do .
so this is the performance working with prototypes , but we can see how different teams are acting .
the average average is about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers do a little bit more , but not much more than the adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
three times the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometrical patterns are the key to build .
ceos do something about average , but there &apos;s interesting .
you put an <unk> administrator on the team , they &apos;re significant better .
it &apos;s amazing . you can see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand it .
and this team , and the work is , in the work , the performance is significant better .
and these are <unk> skills and <unk> and their combination .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , they &apos;re getting about six , they &apos;re about six , they have a strong structure .
i was trying to do something .
i thought , let &apos;s get the <unk> .
so i offered a <unk> prize for software for software .
what do you think about these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team .
if someone could build a <unk> high construction , he would have the prize home .
isn &apos;t it interesting that high arguers have a strong effect ?
we took these exercise with the same students .
what do you think ?
now she understood the advantage of the <unk> .
so the same thing was , bad team of one under the best .
it &apos;s produced the highest construction in the time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us to think about nature and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually do to create a biosignature ?
and the reason i &apos;m making digital tools and processes to help digital tools and processes to help , cars , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what it does is , they &apos;re helping to identify assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , creating a common language , or <unk> , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , of this experience .
and those of you who are interested in <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all the world , like people to optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport sport .
it requires that we all agree with our senses , and we think that we use our thinking , how our emotions and our actions , in the challenge that we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so let &apos;s have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to do .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here .
and i ask myself what they would choose , because i mean my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s looking for the superstar .
i don &apos;t know .
i think you &apos;re sort of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group i need to say .
i don &apos;t want to stop in the past , and not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because we don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was the planet on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re doing : health , affluence , opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was no time like this .
my <unk> died of all when they were 60 .
my grandparents had this number of <unk> .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there was a nine better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox had killed billions of people on this planet .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way , like it didn &apos;t have war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> .
in the wealthy world there are diseases that millions of us are still threatened by one generation .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anyone else knows what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the successes of the scientific method .
and in my view , the scientific approach is to try to figure out whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t change , one of the greatest achievements of humankind .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements and a billion people on this world every day hungry hungry .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not just that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , gas : they &apos;re disappearing , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t come from that mess , we also disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land that they live , to rape .
i think we can feed this world with energy that they don &apos;t .
i believe that , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but it keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that i think is awake at night , and we &apos;ve never been so much as needed as much as well .
and we were also never able to be able to do it , as we can .
we &apos;re at the cusp of an amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet i really think we can hundreds of hundreds of years before the enlightenment to go back to find a time that we &apos;ve gotten on these things in more front lines .
the people in their belief in their belief is so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right in his mind ; it &apos;s actually a right in its opinion .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
you don &apos;t have quite a right facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to find out .
about a decade ago , i &apos;ve written a article about vaccines for &quot; new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed at the opposition to the resistance of what the most effective is in the end of the public health services in history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did just whatever i do , so i wrote an article and went on .
and i soon wrote an article about food change .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote about this article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules on a certain rather than random kind of a <unk> area of a <unk> area .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article . i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type that we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and i couldn &apos;t find it .
and that &apos;s because those who kept me crazy , they didn &apos;t know me at all .
these were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that was so <unk> ...
but then i thought , you know what we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress .
we &apos;re talking about this .
we &apos;re talking about ironic that with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what are reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes in the science , and there &apos;s no reason why this is not supposed to be .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction of 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed that they were quite right . so are they <unk> .
ask questions , ask the evidence , ask them .
take nothing .
but now , if you get the evidence you need to take this evidence , and it &apos;s not good .
and i can say that we live in an epidemic of fear , as i haven &apos;t seen you , and i will never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that had been published in a terrible story with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
in fact , many studies were conducted to see whether this was true .
seventy-five studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , for sweden , in sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what do we believe that we really feel real .
we don &apos;t think about a <unk> of a bunch of documents that we have data , and i understand that , i think that we all do .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating .
<unk> because of this is the fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> are falling for .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
so , does anybody have t.b. ?
have a single audience in the audience , you know ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country at all , it &apos;s not going to be in this country , but in terms of the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because this is not going to happen here , we can do it in denial , and people like <unk> , and messages about <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and larry king live .
and they can do that because they &apos;re not going to connect and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that things seem to be equally , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he has just evolved with a few other people &apos;s developed .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 kids a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , this is good , apart paul walking around paul and says , and says , how are they valuable , and that people are just going to stop .
and that &apos;s what he does .
paul is a terrorist .
when paul comes in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell you without <unk> .
he gets to get calls home because people like to tell him that you know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
if you take them , they go on the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;ve now been <unk> in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me gave me a couple of weeks ago , and i said she &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever said that .
she wouldn &apos;t get their child in <unk> . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe every time , every morning , put somebody in lagos on an airplane and fly in los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s on ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and it &apos;s going to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not like it .
we love it , we know we &apos;re in lying . we love that .
do you have all the vitamins to this morning ?
<unk> , a little retailer , it &apos;s going to give you a little <unk> .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half of the americans that make it every day .
you take the stuff , and you take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
this data shows the time .
they get their urine . they never do it .
this is okay , you want to be 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health system is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and <unk> itself can afford to us .
so we &apos;re walking away , and where do we run ?
we run into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it &apos;s really a serious matter because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions dollars .
and i &apos;m all kind of <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , no , <unk> , <unk> , because i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions dollars of it .
and you know what ? if i tell that people , i &apos;m telling people and say , &quot; what does it matter ? let people do what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt my experts to mammography , &quot; or any <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to that way , where do you believe and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought to 400,000 his people around because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs , we know that they can shorten the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country that &apos;s worse than any other of this disease is <unk> .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
well , the <unk> epidemic we &apos;re right now is this <unk> fight between the <unk> &apos;s genetically fight and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , each of the people .
you know , there were no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 5,000 years .
and some of it has work , and it &apos;s not .
we &apos;re rid of what &apos;s not going to work .
now we can make it more precisely . and of course , there &apos;s risks . but we can do something like vitamin a <unk> , and the stuff can help millions of people in their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do this ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we neglect genetically modified food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing about is a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> hormones , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to have life .
we don &apos;t want companies seeds .
and you know what &apos;s my answer to all this is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
so this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , the science is not a company .
she &apos;s not land .
it &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do work because we &apos;re scared millions of people from <unk> .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . excellent .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? food has changed .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that &apos;s a half billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a <unk> calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and a scientist , all that &apos;s just one .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to that is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask us , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for the hormones that we eat for greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing so far as far as far as we have to do something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty , <unk> .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s ugly , and we really need to stop it .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; you &apos;re still going into this ridiculous time , and the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put that time on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want them to , and we will move them to where we want to .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the time , and we &apos;re going to be happy that we &apos;re going to do that .
i know that we can , and it &apos;s as far as it is , is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some of the time i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , it may seem weird to be interested in it , it &apos;s because you think it &apos;s like a magician that gets into something like that , if someone is very helpful . &quot;
in other words , in some studies have an measurable effect , the <unk> , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to you , is a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , if the patient &apos;s only found enough to think about it .
a delusion is to something , because someone is like that .
so let &apos;s understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been at least since the 1950s in every <unk> for children .
i remember him from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and it &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain to him .
so you see what happens .
the knife you can investigate ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m going to keep the knife just like that .
i get my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing is in my sleeve , or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that there &apos;s no time to no time anything , as long as i &apos;m here , it can &apos;t go into my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully when everything is good , it &apos;s going to be the knife by my bare physical .
it &apos;s in fact that i can shake it , i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes up with my body or comes out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often think of young children who are interested in magic , because you can see a lot about deception if you look closer , although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably a lot of you here in the room here .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i <unk> my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my body goes away or go out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist is that there &apos;s the actual secret secret , is that there &apos;s a real secret .
in the moment , where i put my hand away from you , so you can see it from the back of the back , it &apos;s moving here , my <unk> , just from where he was so <unk> .
great ?
there is someone who didn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s got here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers is changing his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a delusion , why you don &apos;t see that there &apos;s only three fingers to see that there are only three fingers , because the mind and the way he process information , they &apos;re not going to be individually .
but it &apos;s not about it now . and then i open my hand .
now , of course , it &apos;s <unk> , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , who is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing i &apos;m going to get is , it &apos;s going to be driven by the motion of being hidden again .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can take your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really has really been blown me out .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and therefore it was an amazing thing for me .
it &apos;s got this : if you &apos;re a <unk> in the shape of a white pill , in the shape of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round white pill , white pill , white pill .
but if you can change the shape that you give it to a smaller pill into a smaller pill , and these blue colors and a letters that is really measurable .
and that , although none of these <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really resonated with me .
it turned out that it &apos;s not all everything .
if you take a close-up , you &apos;re more powerful than you can do it .
there &apos;s a colored capsule that &apos;s on a end yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
and also the spider plays a role .
a pill twice a day , not as good as three pills -- i &apos;m not going to remember the exact statistics of statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that &apos;s also the <unk> one .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you need to grab a needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> substance -- a couple of a <unk> substance of a <unk> substance to a patient .
that creates a very powerful image in your head . that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
and this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a shot .
so the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has really <unk> , it &apos;s just our belief that it &apos;s just our belief in a stronger .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to take something which is obviously a deception , and let &apos;s make it real .
we know yes from the study that you need to reach to the needle , if it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is a <unk> <unk> . she &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to make you a little bit of a <unk> .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to throw this needle into my skin , and through it , until she &apos;s got back to the other side .
if you drop it out , if you drop it down , i &apos;ve got a couple of friends last night in the room room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman &apos;s almost <unk> .
so i propose that if you &apos;re going to get fast , you look for the next 30 seconds , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to do the first part of here .
you can see it in the same way , you can , but also , if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , on the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . does this crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin through my skin and over the other side of it .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had the <unk> .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> himself to himself the skin , just for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what looks like this is pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and they say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this . &quot;
people in the <unk> are coming in .
let me show you this .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re going to be bad , you don &apos;t look away .
the people back to the back or the one at some point looking at the video , &quot; well , this looks quite impressive , but if it was real , he would make -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it was really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me get a little blood for them .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
usually i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and you show them that there are no <unk> .
but i think , in this framework , and with the intention of a little real real , i &apos;m going to leave the needle just in and so on the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll be excited . thank you .
everyone &apos;s talk about happiness .
i &apos;ve been given some people the number of books that we count with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they took them about 40 , and there were much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these grains of work , there are several cognitive ones that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly by these cognitive traps .
this is true for <unk> who think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just so <unk> .
the first one of these , is a <unk> , complication .
it turns out that the word is simply not useful word anymore , because we apply it to lots of different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we might be able to do it , but in big , and all the things that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to make the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being .
second , the second case is an understanding of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s going to be between happy his lives and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about the fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> student after one of my lectures , who is a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said , he would have a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the recording , there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added to , really quite emotional , that has all been ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
she didn &apos;t care because he was a memory <unk> ; he was ruined , and he was ruined the memory of everything he had .
what we really says is that we could think about other people , in the sense of two ways of self .
there &apos;s an <unk> self that lives in the present lives and the present knows that the past will experience again , but it &apos;s basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> itself , the doctor &apos;s <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt now if i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s the physician saying , &quot; how did you feel at the last time ? &quot;
or &quot; like your journey , albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the <unk> self is part of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts with a basic reaction on our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t tell just stories when we make ourselves .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we consider to be a story .
and let &apos;s <unk> with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients , which is a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into details . it &apos;s not more painful , but she was painful , but she was painful at the 1990s .
they were asked to tell 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who owns ?
and this is a very simple question .
so the patient b has had no longer suffered . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how did these patients do that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient is a much worse <unk> than the patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends up .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse is the pain at its end . it &apos;s a terrible story .
where do we know ?
because we &apos;ve asked these people after their <unk> , and a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
so , from view of view itself had a worse time , b is a worse time .
well , what you could do with the patient is , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , and it works , it could actually be the <unk> of the patient &apos;s patient just by a way to shake it without him .
it &apos;s going to lead that the patient &apos;s suffering , but just a little bit and much less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve got to make it that the <unk> itself is a bad deal , and you &apos;ve got to make it that the <unk> itself is a better story about his experience .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory makes us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
so what &apos;s happening is , a story of <unk> is making considerable moments and end .
end is very , very important , very important and in this case .
well , life life itself lives .
it has moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean most of our life -- and i &apos;ve got this point -- you know , the psychological news is about three seconds , meaning , you know , that there are about 600 million of you , in a month , about 600,000 , most of you don &apos;t .
most of them are completely ignored from <unk> itself .
and yet , you know , they should count the impression that what happened during those moments of life is our lives .
it &apos;s limited resource that we &apos;re using as we &apos;re in the world .
and as we use them , seemingly important , but this is not the story that the self will hold for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the deal with time .
if you have a holiday view of view , if you have a holiday and the second week , just as good as the first one week , it &apos;s so good like the <unk> vacation .
so it doesn &apos;t work at all the time .
for the <unk> , <unk> itself is barely better than the <unk> vacation because there will be no new memories .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , the critical variable is actually the critical variable , which is a <unk> itself from a <unk> self .
well , the <unk> self makes more than to remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually one that &apos;s making decisions , because if you have a patient , you say two <unk> two different surgeons , and deciding what he had to choose two <unk> in two different surgeons and deciding which he needed to vote .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a bit .
we think about our future as a <unk> .
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a tyranny of self , and you can think of yourself as a tyranny of self , and you can think of yourself as one that kind of <unk> <unk> through experiences that doesn &apos;t need it .
i have the impression that if we make a lot of a lot of the case , this is what we &apos;re doing on vacation , in the service of the <unk> self .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how is we <unk> from our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about that , i think we &apos;ve done on a holiday that we &apos;ve made on antarctica , who was clearly the best day i had ever had ever had , and i think quite often about the relation to the relation to other <unk> .
and i probably took my memories on this epic journey , i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the <unk> with the 600 pictures , i would have an hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s an hour and a half a year .
there seems to be there .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , it &apos;s how little appetite i feel on the <unk> of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories of memories of the weight that we give memories of ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
if you ask your next holiday , you know , that &apos;s the end of the <unk> all their images , and you get a <unk> drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
well , would you choose the same day ?
and if you choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between their two types of self and you need to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of time , you might get another answer .
so why we choose the <unk> choice we &apos;re carrying is a problem with a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two species of self are two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of a self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in life <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness by happiness itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to the happiness of the self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy is the person or delighted to think about their lives .
very different term .
each of these terms of terms of these terms of happiness , and i &apos;m involved in a bunch of researchers about the happiness of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being as long as this .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and the satisfaction of the <unk> itself is the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global poll that has more than a half a million people asked more about what they think about their lives and about their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we started thinking about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main thing that we think i &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy somebody with his life is , and you don &apos;t care about how he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you meet somebody else and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life like eight to a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is about his <unk> himself .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what &apos;s called happiness .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly being satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;m told here is that we really don &apos;t really want to imagine if we really don &apos;t want to imagine replacement than a replacement .
it &apos;s another term .
well , all right , another reason we &apos;re not thinking about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same stuff when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california won &apos;t be the correct answer .
if you think that the question you think is that people are happier when they &apos;re happier , let &apos;s say , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what makes it , say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important to the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the <unk> is responsible for itself , you can -- some people could move to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to california , to california , to become happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happy .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happy , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of what was the weather in ohio . and you &apos;ll feel that they &apos;ve got the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;m hoping to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
well , when we heard a couple of weeks ago , you know , there was a pretty interesting outcome that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this place .
is that something that you can collaborate with , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gallup gallup survey is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotions with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more miserable , the poorer they will .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely have seen flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , but that lack of money , you know , lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve .
it &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , in the whole american effort is about life , freedom , freedom to happiness .
if people take this serious seriously , i mean , it seems to everything in the head , everything that we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there an opportunity that politicians generally take a <unk> country like this country and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i believe that there is recognition for the role in the politics of politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening in other countries and in other countries .
people are saying that they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore , or whether they want to explore , we need to explore this conversation quite soon .
how to get happiness is very different depending on how you think and if you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
it will affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , they &apos;re <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
this is going to be part of the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me this issue , or should the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been building now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to save the world &apos;s equivalent to save the world in the reality , as it is in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince you to more people , including them all , more time playing playing games and <unk> play .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we wanted to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i calculated that needed for 21 billion hours a week .
it seems to be a little bit more <unk> , so i &apos;ll plug it to it : if we &apos;re treating problems like hunger , poverty , climate change and obesity , obesity and obesity and obesity , i think we need to play games online for at least 13 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty much why i think games games are so vital for the survival of human species in the future .
this is a tudor photographer <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to catch the emotion of how to catch the emotion of a camera .
this is one of the classical expression .
if you don &apos;t know any player , you might find some of the nuances in this picture .
you see , you probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also , concentration , it &apos;s going to be a real difficult problem .
if you &apos;re going to play , you see some of a couple of <unk> here that are <unk> up , and the mouth is an indication of the optimism . the eyebrows are the surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that they didn &apos;t know so much that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , you know , they &apos;re shocked to be something like that . this is an intentional victory .
this player &apos;s a short victory in front victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of <unk> all over the world , if we have to see the barriers of the next century in the attack , the face of those who are <unk> on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it as &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; <unk> . &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i &apos;m like that , i &apos;m like that , in life , i do bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we looked at better than real life .
that &apos;s a problem that &apos;s a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not as good in the reality of the reality .
and i don &apos;t just succeed . even though it &apos;s heard .
we &apos;re going to get more in <unk> more . i mean , well , i mean , in the context of the relationship with the motivation , and inspired to collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think that many of us are going to turn into our best version , every time , and immediately helpful to try to solve the problem as long as you need to go back to the <unk> again .
and in reality , if we run on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , or depressed , frustrated .
these feelings we never do , when we play games , they don &apos;t just exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a student .
why is it impossible in this way to think , you could not do anything ?
how can we translate these feelings from the <unk> reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for the collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve figured out some things that &apos;s going to do the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
so , first of all , if you &apos;re in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to <unk> them up a <unk> mission , and immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect at your current level , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t fix them .
but always the edge of their capabilities , so they have to work , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around it , and you &apos;re always <unk> . they &apos;re always doing something important .
and there are tons of staff .
wherever you go to , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to do their epic mission .
so we don &apos;t have that in real life , that feeling that there were a lot of <unk> in there .
and there &apos;s another epic story that inspiring history , why we are there and what we do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have defined by &quot; level , &quot; &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + an intelligence . &quot;
this is feedback there &apos;s not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i didn &apos;t like this : &quot; + one speaks and + &quot; + a crazy idea , &quot; <unk> 20 idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of <unk> as the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we would rather spend our entire time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world &apos;s world has been working together for millions of years to solve the virtual problems of solving <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it sounds like bad .
but to see it in the context of <unk> million years ago , we started going to meet our first <unk> .
so the first is so primate .
ok , so when we talk about this , how much time we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend in terms of the magnitude of the human development in terms of the scale of the human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that we use this whole time , in fact , that changes what we are as people .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking so much .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
so , looking at this interesting data , recently recently published by a researcher carnegie university : the average boy man of man in a country with severe <unk> spends 10,000 hours to the 21 .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first once , for children in the united states , <unk> hours of the united states , which they spend in high school , from grade grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a whole bunch of <unk> here where young people are learning as well , what it means to be a good player , like anything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell &apos;s book , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research that if we <unk> 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of another subject to the 21 , we &apos;re going to become <unk> .
we &apos;re going to do so well as the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players who are good ? &quot;
because if we could find that out , we would never have to have a potential of human potential .
so many people do we have in the world that live at least an hour per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people , which are quite good in &quot; something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinarily well in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
so the <unk> advances are designed to save energy and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , with the world , particularly in india , china , brazil can play online .
you expect one extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started to think about what it is like to do these games .
here are the four things that i found . first : <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire , immediately , to do something , a vibrant barrier , with a belief that we have a prepared for hope .
players always believe that an <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worthwhile to try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
gamers are masters in the spiders are <unk> social networks .
there &apos;s a lot more interesting research that shows people more like we &apos;ve played people after we played with them , even if they defeated us .
the reason for that is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time with us , that the rules are going to be <unk> that we have the same goal and until the <unk> .
so it allows the <unk> to grow the <unk> , trust and each other .
and as a result of it , we build stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why of <unk> 22 hours a week playing 22 hours a week .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard to work hard than when we relax .
we know that we &apos;re going to work as human beings work , if we do hard work done .
and the players are willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , is meaning .
so the player &apos;s going to love to be part of the <unk> of the world &apos;s going to be <unk> .
this is a <unk> to the right light light on the right light , you all know , the world , the largest bang in the world .
the second largest bang in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet , as opposed to every other the subject in every other the world .
they created a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a witness from a <unk> virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and this is an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
i don &apos;t like to play -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little <unk> .
so he says that it makes sense , because the players can be more likely to achieve more than real life .
they can play more powerful social bonds than in real life , and they get more feedback and reward rewards in play in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s now fully logical that players in virtual world than in the real time .
i agree for the time that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cubes , from <unk> . you know ?
before these fantastic <unk> were <unk> .
and they were kind of evolved the first of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> of the ancient greek , you may know that you may know this story . the story about how and why games invented .
according to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> while famine .
<unk> was such a great famine , the king of <unk> was a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extremes .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and a national strategy . on a day , you would eat . the next day would you play .
and they would be so much into the <unk> , and there &apos;s so fascinating and we &apos;re so fascinating and with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they had nothing to eat .
and then you would play the next day . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> <unk> , she survived for 18 years , and they were eating a day and the next one .
likewise , i think we &apos;ll sit here today .
we &apos;re playing games for the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games for everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re going to take us what we need .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is the exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years , famine years was not better , and so the king decided to <unk> one last <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a <unk> , and they were able to make a <unk> adventure .
they went out of <unk> , and they were looking for a new home , and they &apos;d like so many people back to the survival of the survival and looked for the rest of the area that they could thrive .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> shows that the <unk> that later the roman empire is the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists , recently , the notion of the crazy story of the crazy story .
and geologists discovered the evidence of a global <unk> , which almost 20 years ago , what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story could be true .
you may have actually saved your people through play for 18 years in games , and then they have these <unk> , and then they had these <unk> and so much about that , they have the whole civilization .
so we can also .
we &apos;re playing since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in real time of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing <unk> for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to play our own <unk> game .
so , you sent half the civilization of your civilization to a new world , and so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should be <unk> that half of us have an hour a day playing an hour , until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the problems of real world in games ? &quot; and i &apos;ve done that question i &apos;ve been working in the last few years at the institute .
we have this banner in the office in palo alto , the way we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to think about the best best result , and then people like to empower this idea into reality .
so we ask ourselves , and give people the opportunities to achieve it .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people to try to get people in their own future .
this is the world without oil . &quot;
the game is about 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it will be realistic for them , and you &apos;re actually going to actually have to figure out how much oil costs , and then you get in the game , tell you how to sign your life , tell us how much oil costs are closed . and then you ask them to do it , video or photos .
we &apos;ve been in this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve got them since over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an adventure and i said , &quot; look oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go .
find out how they survive , most of our players are going to have <unk> habits .
so we have to play for the next <unk> game for a greater , higher objective of them than just <unk> .
we have the game called <unk> , the institute for the future .
this is the calculation of a <unk> that people only haven &apos;t left or 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call of gamers , <unk> , we have almost like a <unk> <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; the astronauts , the scientist , the <unk> , and only they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , let &apos;s say , everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our challenge , the future for energy , food , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 gamers playing this game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google <unk> .
and the last game we put on the third march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award from the world bank , &quot; social <unk> , &quot; <unk> 2010 . &quot;
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and invite them to social learning .
we have a comic . we have &quot; level high , &quot; level up , sustainability , sustainability and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all of this game with young people , all around the world , particularly in the world , particularly in <unk> , who are going to benefit together to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you believe , next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have the real world yet saved .
well , i hope that you agree with me that the human resources are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games will have a big meaning for change .
so we have this whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to get tight social networks , and <unk> and the desire to make meaning .
i &apos;m really hoping that we &apos;re going to play great games for the planet to survive another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like this .
so if i &apos;m in the next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things that we can create each of two things , and we can create each other games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i write in front of a few months ago at mit &apos;s wired .
i always write my <unk> right now , but i was working with the <unk> of the text , and i noticed that i never have in my life , and i noticed that i never mean in my life .
i read them in front of them .
&quot; disabled , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i have this list of a friend read aloud , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just got to <unk> , and i couldn &apos;t stop , and i couldn &apos;t stop reading the <unk> and the following emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i was just thinking that it has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an issue in the early 1980s , when i started using primary school , my sense began to build my sense outside of my family , and to form my sense of self and the rest of the world around me .
and i thank god , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
i would take this point seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me could see me as a person that whose life would be positive in a positive way , but i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity .
so i immediately looked at the <unk> of 2009 , and i expected them to find a <unk> of 2009 .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
in particular tv , i &apos;m going to shake the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe to these words .
it &apos;s about the values that in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the greeks , they were really believed that they had a huge force of a big force , because that &apos;s what you can call <unk> , <unk> .
so , what do we want to do is -- one disabled people or a healthy people ?
in fact , you can call a person more than a child , to call a child , you know , <unk> and you &apos;re <unk> .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them ?
a man who opened for me , was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name you can think of that most americans can &apos;t breathe correctly , so he was called dr. p. p. .
and dr. p. <unk> was very colorful , and it was working for work with kids like created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to build a little bit of these <unk> , so often with these big , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated them more than everything else . i &apos;ve got them . i &apos;ve got them .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even seen as a <unk> child with dr. p. <unk> , and so it &apos;s trying to stop doing this practice without success .
and one day , he showed me in one of my hands -- these were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll get one day of one day .
and if you can make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. <unk> , so i &apos;m making the practice i didn &apos;t want to make with the chance of the richest five year-old girl in the hospital in the second floor , but he made me a new and enjoyable experience .
and i wonder today , how much his vision was as powerful and powerful young girls in my sense , and i could imagine that as one of nature from strong , powerful and <unk> individuals .
this is just an example of a lot of a lot of , like adults in the imagination of a child .
but as you prove the examples of the <unk> examples , our language , our language is not to imagine what we would all wish to do : it &apos;s every single possible to make yourself as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes as well as that in many cases of a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , you know , you know that my legs , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of titanium and artificial <unk> for aging bodies that allow people to understand natural destiny and complaining about social <unk> , people allow them to do natural destiny .
so , maybe that technological change comes out because there &apos;s always another truth , which is that there is always a person of a society can be something very powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt something very powerful and very powerful .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me about how i <unk> with <unk> , and i &apos;m going to feel very uncomfortable with them , and i think very uncomfortable with the questions of people , and i think i was very uncomfortable with that .
this sentence from being <unk> by the idea that success or happiness depended on it , a challenge , without <unk> , a challenge to master , without having been so successful , because if my life would be so successful because i could avoid my disability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i claim that this is good .
<unk> are not an obstacle that we need to be <unk> to us to come with our lives better .
<unk> are just <unk> to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes i can barely see it , but it &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact , or the <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are <unk> and challenges the challenges , and they &apos;re just <unk> real and every person &apos;s about it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come up with <unk> , or not , but how we come from it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people who we love to keep in front of <unk> , but they also prepare to prepare well .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you don &apos;t have to separate two things : the medical fact : the medical fact , and the other social opinion is about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability , which i had to put up to me , is that the world &apos;s time , you know , it could describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart , and they &apos;re the cold , hard truth about your medical likelihood or even a prediction with the quality of life that you would expect , we need to pay attention to that someone is actually disabled .
maybe the current concept that is just what is in a broken , and how we repair it , for each one individual disability and how we repair it , for each one individual disability .
if we don &apos;t treat people , and not all of its forces and possibilities and perceiving all its forces , we create in addition to the natural fight , which you might have to have another disease .
we <unk> a people who has value value for our society .
so we need to look beyond the <unk> , and focusing on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> .
we shouldn &apos;t <unk> these <unk> times , or we shouldn &apos;t do it , we should not try to avoid it , nor should we avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize the <unk> .
i think it &apos;s a bit more about to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of the <unk> , but that we &apos;re open to a hug , you know , they &apos;re open to the <unk> , and maybe you might even dance with it .
and maybe we can do it as a kind of natural , <unk> and useful and useful to see us through the presence of their presence through their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 one of charles darwin and by charles darwin , and when he wrote about the evolution 150 years ago , darwin has written in my eyes to something very true in the human character .
i would like to use it : not the most powerful of his kind of surviving , and also not the <unk> of his kind , but the thing that changes can be at best .
in conflict , creativity is creativity .
it &apos;s not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the capacity of the people , to survive , and <unk> , from the struggle of human mind , is determined by conflict .
so , again , change and customization are the greatest skill of people .
and maybe we don &apos;t know what the wood we are in , if we &apos;re really involved .
potentially , the sense of <unk> , is a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can make ourselves something like this .
we can give up a new meaning that we &apos;re going to go through .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> is a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to it .
i think the biggest thing that we have is to believe that we have to be normal .
let &apos;s face it -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . it &apos;s the typical . but not the normal , and you would really know this arms , gray person , if you really want to learn ?
i think rather .
it would be great if we think of this paradigm against a different possibilities or the strength to make it even a little bit more dangerous , so we can release the forces of very many dangerous to the society , and they invite their very special and valuable skills to society .
we found out that we humans have to have people from members of our society , and they &apos;ve always got an opportunity to do it .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals are about 60,000 years ago , and people have older people with severe physical injuries with severe physical physical injuries , and that happened , because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people are valuable for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as <unk> and <unk> , and they were treated as something special and precious .
a few years ago , i went to the city in the town i grew up in the <unk> in the <unk> in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there in front of a tomato tomato sauce .
it was summer , and i had <unk> <unk> .
and i hear the guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who is he .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , they &apos;re not allowed to remember me .
when i saw her first time , i took her out of her mother . &quot;
oh , you know .
and then , of course , it did .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i knew only about narratives of my mother over this day , because i of course , quite typical of my birthday was late .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> my mom was on holiday , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and since i was born , i became born , and my feet were born after you , and i just had a few toes on this and a couple of toes on this and he was the <unk> of the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell you the parents would never walk , and they would never be as mobile as other kids or you could never live an independent life , and then they have me <unk> . &quot;
really , i found that he had collected my entire childhood <unk> , no matter , if i had a <unk> in the class of the second class , whether i won my scholarship or one of my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he took these clips to teach his students .
and he called this part of his <unk> &apos;s potential , the potential of human being willing .
you can &apos;t stop enough to emphasize how to be critical for the quality of life of a person .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that children , if you don &apos;t get anything else , if you don &apos;t get a bit of a support , if you can get kids , you can get a lot . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his mindset .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with , two different things .
and also , i think , in the course of time , when i asked me at the age of 15 years at age of meat and bones , i &apos;d asked my <unk> against legs and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i didn &apos;t want to make normal work .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experiences .
and maybe that change was going to happen , because i &apos;ve been a lot of people who have opened to the doors , rather than people to face me , and i wanted to give an idea of <unk> .
you see , it really takes a people who show you how to <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you can give it to someone to activate its own , internal forces -- the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment a door open , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something to create something that is , in one , the potential .
again , what &apos;s potential to do we know ?
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , in britain was done in the u.k. , we were transformed into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the u.s. &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
students are going to get into the notes .
and the students are going to be <unk> harder for the better teachers .
and you &apos;ve got them over a <unk> period , <unk> <unk> , and they were told , they were <unk> that they were very smart . and after three months , she wrote a <unk> .
and , of course , it &apos;s going to be a heart to hear that vice versa , the vice versa , they &apos;re just enough .
and it &apos;s just the three months .
but just those who still were at school , besides -- besides the students who had to school school .
the key thing about this trial was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something has changed .
they were just told that they were the <unk> , and they &apos;re the students with the grade . and they &apos;ve got something they teach them , and they treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind of a mind that has broken , has no hope . it doesn &apos;t find a hope of it . it finds nothing more <unk> , <unk> , and our collective ability of imagination .
but if we manage it to help the human mind , to continue to hope to yourself and other people around them to find beautiful , curious and <unk> , and then we put our forces really positive .
if a spirit about these qualities , we can actually create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the 14th century , and by my friend jacques <unk> , and the poem is saying , &quot; every child knows , &quot; &quot; every child knows god , &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god &apos;s dance . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
so suppose i said that , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more precise and faster and faster .
or want to be <unk> , more powerful , more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always <unk> for more than more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many of the creative people there are .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say , as a doctor .
if you could just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this just a conceit ?
or is it maybe possible ?
evolution is a <unk> issue here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor of a doctor .
the big geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> on the russian orthodox church , wrote a essay called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t think of biology . &quot;
well , if you are one of those who are not the evidence for the biological evolution , that would be a very good time , your <unk> , take your personal <unk> -- i give you permission -- and you might give you the lens -- and you might see nothing else .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think this is just about the past , or it &apos;s about the future ?
is it for other <unk> , or it &apos;s also too ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this image , i have an bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> of these branches have been success : they &apos;ve survived ; it &apos;s got to be fitness and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , very far , is , of course , is what we &apos;re interested in most of most .
we &apos;re mapping from a shared ancestor , about six or eight million years .
in this period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different types of hominids of hominids .
some went and went .
we &apos;ve been here for <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re pretty remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , the biggest mechanisms are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is you clear that we can pull out and create the mechanics of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is used to treat <unk> <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> of what &apos;s wrong .
and while we talk about bacteria , you know , that each of us in our gut are more likely to be more in our gut bacteria than the other cells ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think when antonio damasio comes to your question , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you will all of the nutrients that you could only wish to do without effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re not going to help for digestion nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a sort of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or is we think something else is going to be different -- something that &apos;s actually adapted to the environment .
now let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indication of being 800 to four billion years on earth -- first of three to four years ago .
in this great <unk> symphony symphony in the universe , is life on earth just short ; the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> .
we were .
and this is the <unk> of this talk , so i hope , ace of the ace of them .
well , when i was a <unk> college at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by definition and beauty biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i asked something very fundamental , in most of the existence of living in <unk> organisms , <unk> every cell , and all the genetic information is going on in both of the cell .
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms , things started to change things .
sexual reproduction is coming in the image .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome of sexual reproduction , is the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body is in evolution at the same time as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but every year , is there .
i &apos;ve got to get the feelings of george burns , who fell in las vegas in las vegas show in the 1990s .
and one night , there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
front of it is a beautiful <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
and i came to know as a physician &apos;s physician that i was in a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily criteria .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to explore the health of a disease .
i wanted to make a long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about the <unk> of the genome to the next generation , <unk> and generation generation .
and from a evolutionary standpoint , it &apos;s and i think like <unk> rockets to get the genetic <unk> into the next stage of the orbit to send it into the ocean .
i think we all would all the mood the mood that woody all of the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality through my work .
i don &apos;t want to die by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to the largest life of life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily <unk> the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that are best at their environment .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean bacteria , the <unk> are there , and that hot , <unk> , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum , they would have a vacuum , they would have managed to have a <unk> environment .
so what does that mean , if we think of what &apos;s going on in evolution in evolution , and how we think about the place of the place of people in evolution , and particularly as we <unk> in the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to go forward .
we have a kind of balance .
and the reason that we would be able to do that is that we &apos;ve succeeded in medicine , a lot of the genes that were otherwise <unk> , and they were removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species we have our environment so that we &apos;ve done it to us , that they adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we &apos;re walking around , and we can make ourselves so much that you can &apos;t say , that isolation is necessary for evolution .
a second opportunity is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional type , of course , by the forces of nature .
and the argument here is the wheels of evolution , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far that isolation is going to be , if we colonize as a species , it will be <unk> and the changes of the environment that could make evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not easy , but led and decided to make us as a <unk> in the decision we do .
now how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s face the reality that people are making , in some cultures decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , choices for more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so if you think it &apos;s not just possible gender of your child &apos;s gender , but also the body genetic adaptations will cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes for diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s disease or stem cell emissions ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do these changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , it could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome for about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more long , until the reality is that there will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will become increasingly available for everyone .
a week ago , led the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , which developed the natural process of evolution that makes the natural process of evolution to lead faster and <unk> proteins . &quot;
a few years ago , the <unk> of the scientist <unk> was awarded for his research in which he took a grown-up <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell induced to a <unk> will be able to get to your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that makes the human insulin in bacteria can produce viruses that are not only protection of themselves before themselves , but also can serve immunity to other viruses .
whether it doesn &apos;t believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gait of influenza that has been grown in the cells in the cells .
can you imagine something good ? it &apos;s made of tobacco ?
this is all reality , and the future will be much more possible .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your respective ?
what if it would be the <unk> and <unk> or the <unk> <unk> <unk> to make their kids a better chance to give their kids a better chance to give you the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer .
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can enable the changes of the science to prevent disease to prevent the disease , allowing us to adopt the better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially if you can get it to the next generation of the <unk> ?
why don &apos;t we have the quick <unk> that will allow you to get faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the <unk> that we &apos;re going to be transformed , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process where we might have 100,000 years , which is that we can compress it to a thousand years , and maybe in the next hundred years .
these are decisions with these are choices with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren .
do we use these decisions a society that is better , more successful , more friendly ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us , and not for others ?
are we going to be a society with <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we &apos;re going to face .
and the deepest of all , we will ever be able to evolve the wisdom , and the wisdom that we will need to make these decisions ?
in the good like , in the evil days , as you might think , these decisions are going to be these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine that you can imagine a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another one , the <unk> helps to come up and go up and go .
we call this robot <unk> robots .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning , and it &apos;s extra strength to give them extra strength , and that will continue to help them , for example .
this is actually the real <unk> of man and machine .
but not just that -- it and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who &apos;s about 100 pounds on his spine , and it &apos;s going to be the request that they &apos;re going to wear .
of course , this is some major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- <unk> <unk> .
so we thought that we would embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help us with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or the human being universal <unk> .
a soldier with the <unk> terrain i can wear 200 pounds of <unk> terrain for many hours .
so his intelligent design allows you to make it deep deep , <unk> and highly <unk> .
it feels what i want to go to where i want to go and increase in my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re in the way to introduce this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s now take our gaze on the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there &apos;s 68 million people who have been in the wheelchair around in the wheelchair .
it &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and this is actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal young people with spinal cord spinal life in the <unk> of the body -- 20s , 30s -- the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose number .
and so pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a <unk> , or the other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years since his , as i say , very successful introduction .
so we thought that we could start an entirely new chapter to create a whole new model of mobility .
so let me introduce you to <unk> this <unk> of amanda , which is that 19 years ago , a <unk> ago that she couldn &apos;t run anymore for 19 years and until now .
thank you .
like i said , amanda is <unk> .
it has sensors .
its completely <unk> sensors on the crutches , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is here on her back .
and here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on its hips as well as the <unk> <unk> that they move forward in this very <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost each feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my inbox and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he leaves every <unk> of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to learn to go again to ski again , to climb again , and even with the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us , and to discuss them with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life in future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all the <unk> , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i was ceo of a non-profit organization of a non-profit organization called <unk> .
if i was not the poverty of poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> with a volunteer <unk> fire .
now , in our town , in the volunteers of a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ve got to be pretty early to be pretty early on the <unk> to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second of the <unk> <unk> , so i was quite good opportunities in it .
but it was still a race for the other volunteers to reach the <unk> <unk> to try and figure out what was going to happen .
when i was the <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which was certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the <unk> and a <unk> outside of a screen in the <unk> rain while her house in flames .
and the other volunteers i arrived in to me was -- let &apos;s call him a <unk> of luther luther luther luther first and sent to the house first and asked the dog to save the dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was some lawyer or <unk> , who now for the rest of his life , the people who could tell him that he was a <unk> house to save a living living , because it was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> to me .
he said , &quot; <unk> , you need to go into the house .
they need to go up to the fire , and you need to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i was hoping for , but i went -- walking up the stairs up the hallway on the hallway , on the hallway at that point , &quot; real &quot; <unk> , which is at that point in a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking about , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i put my prey back to the bottom , where i <unk> my <unk> and her loved dog .
we put it out to the <unk> , the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> <unk> was a letter of the <unk> , where she was <unk> for the brave <unk> .
you know , one of them might have heard of kindness : somebody had a few shoes .
so both in my profession , robin hood , as well as a <unk> in my inbox as a volunteer firefighter , i witnessed of generosity and kindness at the scale of the big scale , but i can see it &apos;s <unk> .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room and people see that either have a <unk> success , or on their way , i want to offer that memory has to offer you : wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in another life , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give you something , you give it .
you use them in a <unk> , <unk> a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save life of a person , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so they put them off ; they save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going to go from a community that &apos;s the secret of the human <unk> of humankind .
a place where the women would lead to the <unk> sex with sex , and the game game determines -- where &apos;s fun .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their <unk> .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living with chimpanzees .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which is about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees of great , fear of <unk> are going to be led to be <unk> by <unk> females .
they really have this kind of thing up because that leads to a <unk> society , in the lethal violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos at least known as primates .
they &apos;re living in the depths of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re only the observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country &apos;s extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent argument that has been planned for decades and almost as many lives .
it &apos;s not surprising that the destruction of the bonobos are at risk .
<unk> and the <unk> <unk> lead to the <unk> bonobos could fill it -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the trees was .
who are these related ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> <unk> , <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying this is the answer to all of all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos are made of more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just <unk> .
for us , and she &apos;s kind of engaging with attachment by relationships and the care of the <unk> .
learning trust and the rules of the game .
play dramatically creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of creation -- variety of interactions , variety of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity on connections , diversity .
and if you look at bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight from the wild wilderness .
first of all , a <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> <unk> .
see what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; it &apos;s put it on the eggs . &quot;
i mean , i think it &apos;s like it &apos;s not true .
yeah !
so <unk> is distributed , both of bonobos are being traced as well .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , where you get new elements to play new elements -- like the testes -- and also , like it &apos;s hard fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take lots of shapes that some of some are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to explore the back again .
and i want to show you , this is a <unk> , a young female , and she plays with water .
i think , just like you &apos;re going to do that sometimes , and we <unk> boundaries of our inner and outside worlds .
and it &apos;s kind of playful curiosity to make us explore , and interact , and the unexpected fragments that we create , are the real ingredient in creativity .
this is just a little predictor of the insights , the bonobos give us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s also true to a mystery for our future , a future that we need to adapt to the greater challenges , by greater creativity and cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , our <unk> is our <unk> .
to be successful in a <unk> world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life doesn &apos;t come from teeth and claws .
now , if it &apos;s barely appropriate , maybe it may seem to play .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s give you this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re doing the creativity of <unk> and <unk> .
thank you .
i want you to introduce two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , in the same day , at the same day , at the same day , every <unk> one baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each <unk> is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want them to use too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you imagine the whole time you imagine , you &apos;re not listening .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case that &apos;s a case called a <unk> <unk> , which is the x chromosome in the <unk> .
and in the other case , this is a result of the x chromosome that &apos;s on the x chromosome .
they &apos;re both <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;ll come later on these people later .
in most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of the anatomy .
i studied <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy <unk> -- that &apos;s the body , animal bodies , animal bodies -- like they thought about the body <unk> , <unk> .
so the other hat i &apos;ve been carrying in my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as a <unk> lawyer -- of people who are patients from doctors who are born with doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> social norms .
so , i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people who worked with <unk> -- so people who were very common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different shapes .
i &apos;m just going to give you some examples of the kinds of <unk> guys that are not going to be the male or female standard female .
in one case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> leaves the <unk> that we all have the stage to fall in .
and that &apos;s why the testicles will pick testosterone .
but because this individual receptors missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone of the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction .
as a consequence , the body is more of the body as a consequence of the body .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as girls .
but it takes time until they reached puberty and their breasts grow , and they &apos;re going to grow up , and they &apos;re developing , but not their <unk> gets something different .
and they do some tests and find out that they rather rather than <unk> and <unk> in reality , and you &apos;re in reality that you have a phantom chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person for the fact that you could think that person for you may be more likely .
women , like men , have something that &apos;s called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the <unk> represent <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think , i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably have a typical -- most women like i &apos;m talking about <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the implication is that somebody like me in a brain that was more <unk> than a woman who was born with <unk> , and a woman has been born .
so what &apos;s gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender , gender -- in a way , can you spread across the whole range of bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 , man , who was born as a boy , he had a girlfriend , he had a girlfriend , he had a girlfriend with his girlfriend , and he had just figured out that he had <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , it was so strong , so strong , that they basically created a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> &apos;s male , his brain was the <unk> male part of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody could see something .
and when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually he got enough medical problems , in fact , because it &apos;s <unk> that the physicians found out that he was female .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , which is something called <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
gender can occur in many different forms .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often to be adapted to the norm , isn &apos;t because it could be for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why do you often get different kinds of interventions , because they threaten our social categories .
in fact , our system is based on the idea that has an anatomical form with a certain amount of identity .
so we have the concept that woman has to be a woman to have a female identity ; a black person is to be said to have a african anatomy .
so we have this kind of <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually something very different , confused by actually something very different , confused with these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , the two people are born in a body .
where i had most of the most exciting thing ever had ever experienced was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender was <unk> in berlin .
many journalists would call me a lot of the question : &quot; what test test you will make that tell us whether or <unk> female female or male ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that it &apos;s not there .
now we know that gender is complicated enough , that we need to admit that nature is not between male and female leaders , or between the male and <unk> and female and female , and the <unk> , we are , the <unk> .
so we have a situation so where we need our science at the time , we need to acknowledge that these categories that we were able to get in charge of authoritarian categories which are very simple <unk> made to create permanent <unk> .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true in the race race , which is much more complicated than our <unk> .
in our way , we put in all sorts of <unk> areas .
let &apos;s turn into the fact that we &apos;re at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from you through a few <unk> ?
while we continue to move our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly going into a zone of <unk> where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we had probably too simple .
we see that in all kinds of human life .
one of the regions that we see in the <unk> is in our world culture , in the world today , are the fights over the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got hard talks about what the body is to the people &apos;s body , so that he &apos;s a different rather than <unk> life .
we &apos;ve got very hard on these days -- maybe not in the same way in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
you have someone else &apos;s feather a feather under his nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t bury them yet .
if you didn &apos;t moved more , you &apos;ve got it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation today where we could take people to take care of organs and you want to put them other people .
and as a result , we got to the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really hard situation where we don &apos;t have a very simple , very simple categories .
well , you could assume that the whole crash of categories would someone like me happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s really nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , does .
and it makes me clear that democracy is about democracy .
so to tell you about that <unk> , i &apos;ve got to <unk> , i &apos;m first fan of the founding .
i know that they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and they were very strong , and so radical , what they did was that i would take a few years to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely too .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s <unk> with the <unk> .
the founding of my view were the original <unk> activists , which is why .
what she was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they replaced it through another , and beautiful and beautiful and 200 years for us .
and as you all remember , <unk> was the concept of the monarchy at the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the masters of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion of that people who had political power to the political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of the grandfather , for the son and so on .
so the founding of the idea was back , and they replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all the people were created .
they <unk> the field in the field and decided that , <unk> , which is the difference , and that was very radical .
well , they did this part because they were part of a <unk> system where two things together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science continued to do science .
if you look at the story of the fossil record , that many of you were very interested in science , and they were in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from explanations , <unk> things , such as a <unk> concept of power , back , where the transmission is based on a very <unk> concept of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it was a concept that was common by <unk> .
and they really have a wonderful way of the future rights rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened ?
for example , women who <unk> the <unk> , the concept of the founding of the founding , which says that psychologists tend to be more important than the anatomical difference , and we said that we have a <unk> and <unk> the very property , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> .
when the next century , the successful civil rights , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; am i no woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> line that says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different skin color , which is in anatomical terms of <unk> differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
and of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the commonalities , we need to ask ourselves to ask , why we &apos;re going to sustain certain <unk> .
well , mind , i &apos;d like to maintain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish that doesn &apos;t give the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be the right thing to spend your permission or to get married .
so there &apos;s some anatomical <unk> that make sense for me , and we think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re making sense .
so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both of the middle 1979 , both in 1979 .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , was born , three months <unk> , so she was born near 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to <unk> , so he was born at one march 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born , three months <unk> , they get all sorts of right back three months before <unk> -- the law must have sex , right .
<unk> has to wait for all this , not because it &apos;s a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other <unk> about what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the male <unk> -- because you think that he is male , he can now worry , what is he &apos;s male .
maria , in fact , can &apos;t be the same thing in all states the same way , the <unk> <unk> in all states , and that &apos;s quite a happy .
<unk> can marry a woman in every country , but maria can only marry a woman in a few countries .
so we &apos;re all these permanently <unk> categories in many ways , are problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do is that our science of progress in the field of the anatomy is that we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like the science itself on its own .
so where are we going ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to move somewhere somewhere , so we move them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people <unk> in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at a point , texas , is that , a man means to marry , you know , you have no chromosome , and a woman to marry , you know , you &apos;ve got a <unk> chromosome .
now in practice , people are not going to test people on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i dream , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people , &quot; their skin color , but according to their character , &quot; judge , and goes through anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you tell people about their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to get to the people right now , because i &apos;m going to admit that i know a number of golden <unk> , which are probably more important than some people i know .
i want to <unk> that i &apos;m probably going to be some bright <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , more intelligently , more intelligently , more intelligently to make their sexual relationships as some <unk> i know .
so how to we do the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of my question is what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be in the future that would be made in the future -- could be made ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is a leader in the united states , thinking about questions of democracy .
in our quest for democracy , we have our very good job , and i think we would make it in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like it for instance , in iran , where a man who are attracted to other men , with death , unless it &apos;s ready to be a <unk> , where he &apos;s ready to be alive .
don &apos;t exist in this way .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon with a which i talked about a few years ago , who had <unk> twins with his name to make a name .
but when i looked at him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high <unk> operations -- was his answer that in his country , these kids were very bad treated , and therefore he had to be treated .
and i said to him , &quot; well , if you &apos;ve got a political driver , rather than a operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states have incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are , without they will change the state of will .
so i think we need to be a leader .
well , just to finish , i want to realize that i was very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about how democracy might look like democracy could look like , or looked at the mothers .
and i want to say something is radical for a feminist &apos;s feminist , and i think there could be different ways that are the anatomy of different kinds of anatomy , <unk> people of the anatomy .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research , i &apos;ve been interested in research .
and one of the things that i really thought was interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not every but on average -- more complex social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable within the world , very much .
and therefore , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation .
before years ago , when i was a graduate student , i asked myself one of my <unk> , who was my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist question .
he said , &quot; tell me what is female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about stereotypes about gender , which is why feminism is not female .
but the more i ever thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something wrong in feminism .
this is supposed to be , there could be something , on average , which is female , which is female brains of male differ for social relations , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers were extremely important to figure out how to be protected from the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that when we more moms in this concept , we &apos;re more like a concept of <unk> , not just how to preserve it .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to be in the future if we democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body -- less about the individual body , and more about relationships .
so that when we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you , what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it to every opportunity to find another <unk> , <unk> outfit , and in the last time , it &apos;s also to photograph and to photograph .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of a second hand in <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
it allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment , and that &apos;s the environment of my purse .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars serve for a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to buy a personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it my height ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it be less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers is loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve done for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pair of <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly one week , what i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve got a bet i &apos;d like to wear anything , which i might find , if i left palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman , who &apos;s here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found , i found a few things .
and i want to show you my <unk> for this week .
does this sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to tell you some of the lessons that i believe you don &apos;t believe it or not , from these <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call the <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t need to spend a lot of money to get great .
you can almost look more about less than 50 dollars .
this whole thing , including the wheel has me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this entire week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad <unk> if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : <unk> is totally <unk> .
i have a lot of time in my life to try to be trying to be myself , and at the same time .
they &apos;re just who they are .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the right people , you &apos;re not just understanding them , you &apos;re going to estimate it .
wednesday wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes i sometimes tell people , i looked like i play &apos; games , or i think you can remember it .
i smile , and i like , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s pretty safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not going to look good enough , they &apos;re probably quite right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap it for a minute .
if you think they &apos;re a wonderful person inside and there &apos;s a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can do .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
on friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> .
and finally , saturday : a personal , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell you a little bit about one of the world , without having a word to say a word .
it was always proven to me , and over again , when people came to me on me , just because what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
it &apos;s obviously not all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home after brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to make these things , because the <unk> is always going to be another <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , waiting for me , if i love a little love in the heart and you search it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as <unk> as flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows in italy with this picture in italy , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is that the formula one has something very interesting .
some time ago , it was so that if you wanted to win a formula for a race , then they took her budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver &apos;s good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , you actually want to win something like this one here -- something that &apos;s the car in real time , a few thousand sensors , the information that information is going on , and then you process that information is collected .
this would you , in <unk> , a <unk> call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s from two parts -- a <unk> portion and a <unk> portion .
so what &apos;s interesting about today is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities have been working in the last couple of years , working with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
and as a computer , in the free , they start to react to the other way , they &apos;re perceived and <unk> .
if we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just the way i want to mention is that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s land .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of that sense , all of this sense and drive into objects of everyday life .
this is an exhibition called paola antonelli at moma , in the year , in the summer , in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk back .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there , a sensor and a sensor <unk> .
and that &apos;s really extraordinary the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses , he says that he took the hammer on the end , and it took him on moses , you can still see a little bit of <unk> -- and i said , called <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
well today , our environment starts for the first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and <unk> .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i &apos;d like to think is in fact one of the first our lab .
it was developed in italy four years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done since was actually a new kind of network of the network that was used around the world -- this is a <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk> information from this network , which is collected from the phone , to understand how the phone is working .
the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was when the <unk> won won .
some of you will remember , it was a italy against france , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , in italy .
now you can see what happened on this day , just looking at the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , before the game .
you see the time .
and then afternoon , people used to make the phone calls and move around .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a gateway . in italy .
<unk> , people make a short call , go to toilet toilet .
second <unk> . end of the normal <unk> .
first of all , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
in italy . yeah .
well , at that night , we went to center .
they saw the big thing .
the next day , they went to the center to the <unk> and the prime minister and the prime minister .
and then everybody went down .
you can see the image of the place , <unk> <unk> , where , since the <unk> time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the question at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we feel today the city can feel , in a way , like we couldn &apos;t .
another quick example , another example : this is not about people , but the things we use and consume things we consume .
well , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that you show you all the chips , which is a mac computer , like they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go .
so we actually have some little markers in this project to track the garbage through the trash while it comes through the system .
so we started with a couple of volunteers that we have , a little more than a year ago , in seattle , the things that they have helped -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would see .
and then we have the little potato chips , the little brands , the little brands , and they started to track it .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve got right now .
in seattle ...
after a week .
with that information that we realized there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in which we do with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away , is that they still throw away somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day .
and if we show people , we can move into a behavior behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more about that , and the whole other wonderful things that you can perceive with , i want to talk to the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and <unk> a beautiful tradition of working in public areas as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you create technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that happened to be in a <unk> <unk> , imagine , imagine these tubes , and the valves , <unk> , whatever , and close .
they do something like a <unk> with <unk> water .
if those tiles fall , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to you , to let you see how you can see on this picture .
well , we launched the mayor .
it &apos;s got very well .
and we got to make a building a building in the expo of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re going to approach it , it &apos;s going to open and you .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to reduce it , you can even lower the roof .
or you could have the building , and the whole architecture is going to be like in this case , you know , this time when you <unk> the roof , you get pictures of people who were there , and they say , &quot; they have the building . &quot;
no , they have not destroyed the building , it &apos;s just so that the architecture is almost disappearing .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks you what happens inside the inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the test of the sensors that the water opened the water , not wet .
well , i should tell you what one night is going to happen at night as all the rest stopped .
but actually , it was a more fun fun .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer longer a building that would open it to you , but a building that still breaks and holes and holes in the water , you had to get rid of it now .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how the people we use things we design .
but the reality is always unexpected .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are being used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building , <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections on it .
and this is what makes us think about the project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine if these <unk> could really start to fly .
imagine you could have little <unk> that walking through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost as a cloud can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter in front of you saw earlier , which is completely moving to the other , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or an ad , like these -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently , but infrequently , in three dimensions , where changes the light changes .
you can play with different ways .
imagine if the screen could appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from <unk> , which you can , and you can move through the way that you can see it from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , <unk> <unk> to form a <unk> .
if you turn the lights on it , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person is being treated .
it could have an impulse to have a impulse that is coming from people who come from the motions of the people or so on .
i want to show you a little first one here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> <unk> at the metropolitan theater in 3d -- we &apos;ve taken his movement in 3d <unk> to use them as a momentum .
here you see dancing dancing .
on the left you see the <unk> , the different sensations , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so you can feel the whole movement .
you can make it all the time .
but then , if we have all <unk> , you can play with color and color movement and <unk> .
this is what we want to do as a kind of impulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we work on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working for for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people with something to do something , and the environment is almost like we call it <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that every single donation can give you a little donation for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable of the things last years , the last decades is that we have a physical one of the digital world .
it &apos;s got all over digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s going through the internet .
nowadays , we can for the first time -- and the president &apos; 60s has shown this -- we can , from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the networks to the physical world .
it can be in our case that we use it to design and a symbol .
this is what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can make us the next challenge -- think of the climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to change .
so the idea is that we actually do the people involved in that they are doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is back to a cloud of <unk> in the same way as a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud .
it &apos;s a new thing in london , but covered with <unk> .
they can move inside and different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and other parts , and it &apos;s as kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go to the top of the sky and something at the top of london .
they can go inside .
and a sort of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are separated from nature , and that &apos;s all connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
jim awe .
my heart conductor . i was <unk> , while i was trying to grab what i was .
the <unk> around me was 60 feet from the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year after year .
<unk> is born as a calf of a glacier or by <unk> of <unk> .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact in clear ways with their surroundings and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and <unk> to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t withstand more and <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated isolated , apart and just as we humans see .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg , it &apos;s melting , i <unk> its <unk> atmosphere .
during the iceberg , it &apos;s got <unk> drinking water that makes lots of life .
i &apos;m going to go on my footage of this <unk> as if i was portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that they exist in these individual moments of this way , and never again .
it &apos;s not a death when it &apos;s melting ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of your life life .
a part of the ice in the <unk> is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i put a iceberg in greenland in greenland .
very rare in fact , you actually witnessed a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
if you look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it makes about 120 feet of the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just as it shows you a different side of his character .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary to work in some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , was this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back , and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of this as .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was telling him .
i have a company called design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the world &apos;s world .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and his cause to support .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we will give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk about tony .
i just want to talk back to him , and i asked , &quot; wait time , is that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking &apos;s not -- can &apos;t all the <unk> people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about the <unk> and a remarkable insurance can you really do that .
normal people are not going to be accessible . &quot;
and i was like , &quot; how do you know ? &quot;
does someone have the film &quot; <unk> and <unk> &quot; ?
so they communicate -- they &apos;re running their fingers .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can it be ? &quot;
so i came up with a need , just a check check a check and i asked a check check a check that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of what i needed .
i was reminded of the place , and it &apos;s about his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to be speaking , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art .
because it &apos;s an farce that somebody who has yet , it &apos;s not communicate to communicate . &quot;
so i was talking about a few months later .
and i met these people from <unk> , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on every surface , and then they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then the appropriate area of the negative area .
so they &apos;re pulling around and do <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are going on top up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , and then the <unk> , after the least people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life life in their presentation .
so i went home and i ate with my wife and she told her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there is this technology that you can use your eyes to create things , and then we should find a way that he could make a laser . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year , after a year and a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have reached some things .
first , we have the <unk> doors , and actually we have the doors , and they actually have a device to get a device to communicate -- a stephen <unk> .
this was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children , and i went into the garage , and this hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> .
so many of our friends thought that we were beautiful , that we &apos;re beautiful , and we all the pictures on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to <unk> <unk> in venice , my children were involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the prototype and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they put them on a <unk> , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can put the code for free to the software , the software can do for free .
so we created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
it &apos;s not a hospital .
each <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , this was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in the <unk> room .
i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all this <unk> from the great revelation .
and after about a year , two weeks ago , two weeks ago , <unk> and <unk> nights , <unk> and <unk> nights .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he sees about his life .
we have his bed , so it can see it outside .
we &apos;ve got a tag on a wall in front of the hospital in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was in the parking lot .
<unk> , we had to do it again in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the <unk> .
at the end , he asked us an email content : &quot; for the first time , &quot; for the first time for seven years .
i feel the feeling , i got under the water , and i finally got somebody down down and my head up to the bottom , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t it ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that keeps us , and let &apos;s continue to evolve .
and we need to improve a lot of this machine .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> right .
and someone who has a <unk> potential to make it much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us .
it comes from our own pockets .
so they were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us , and then , in december , has been honored to us as one of the most 50 inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
and the <unk> of this is -- and this is all the circle -- that there is this april , in <unk> <unk> in downtown city of los angeles a show called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and there will be pretty much the hardest representatives of the world &apos;s population -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty lame .
so basically , to me , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i didn &apos;t have anything to do with <unk> , but i &apos;ve just got a little bit caught and me with amazing people , so we could put something together on the legs .
and that question , every one of them should ask you , every single day that you can think of something that &apos;s going to be done . if not now , when you don &apos;t know who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i probably think of america &apos;s most commonly <unk> .
and i always tell the people that i don &apos;t want to come .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen the farmer .
today , i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you have it somewhere .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of a more complicated circle of what i want to tell you today .
so my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was green in the <unk> green and blue beaten , until she saved my life .
she saved my life by making me the toilet at the <unk> .
they did that .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had to get <unk> , and it turned out to san francisco in california -- i found a <unk> -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it &apos;s important at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from the night of this teacher , a woman who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , and i &apos;m going to come to ohio , and please come along with the man i &apos;ve found you .
and i should mention that i have a <unk> , and i think i want you to go . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laugh , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we went around them to , and we gave us to her family eight , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know me as an adult , i turned them into a box of <unk> and <unk> into my hands .
what happens was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of which i was talking about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i &apos;m saving her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything in the rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is happening today .
it needs to be the same -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s like us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a great blast , as you go to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
this is <unk> fear .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat in <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot was already <unk> , and we weren &apos;t so far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up to the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route .
it turns out the <unk> .
imagine a <unk> aircraft .
and then he said three words -- the previous words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more .
i could see it in her eyes , there was my life .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned that day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have these <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in the lives , and i thought to all the people i wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to do , and i never made all .
while i was thinking about it , i noticed a phrase that is , &quot; i &apos;m eating bad wines .
because if the wine is as far as it is the person , then i open it .
i never want more to change more in life .
and this urgency , that goal is really changing my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george bridge , so much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my own mistakes , i got to better , to become better in everything i <unk> .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego space .
and i <unk> the time i wasted for <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to my wife , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to be negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i haven &apos;t got two years away with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the internal clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please throw in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
as we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , to die , is not scary .
almost as we would prepare for our lives , for example .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want ; i love my life .
and the sadness really <unk> in a thought , which is that i just wish to do one thing .
i wished i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i went to visit one every month of my daughter -- <unk> , not much <unk> .
... not .
and i <unk> , i don &apos;t like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense for me .
i realized that at the time , i realized that it &apos;s just a great father to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my greatest goal in life to be a good father .
i became the miracle of the day that day not die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and coming back and come in different ways .
my call everyone who &apos;s going to fly today is , imagine , the same thing happens in your flight -- not -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they throw it because they think they &apos;re always there forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , you are the best parents ever can be .
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is quite straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important thing for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if you can do that , the systems are going to <unk> , which <unk> and the <unk> control , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these <unk> don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on another technology .
but if we can do it that is an effective <unk> on a laptop &apos;s laptop that &apos;s being used by a <unk> to <unk> the gray box , and then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will be thrown into the gray box box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started doing our research , six months ago , absolutely unknown , what was the purpose of the purpose and purpose of this .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most difficult part , the <unk> part , he made by <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> .
and it seemed like something <unk> , with these <unk> boxes .
so the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project where we saw our environment with a <unk> infected , and we studied that .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> it , but he didn &apos;t eat it .
that didn &apos;t make any sense .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a <unk> attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> activated in the gray box , when a special configuration is discovered , even if the special program is discovered , it &apos;s trying to cut on that goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t <unk> anything .
so , really , really , my interest and we started to work with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> code , and we found that it &apos;s in two digital journal -- a smaller and a larger .
and also , we noticed that they were very professional constructed , from people who had gotten all of the information available all the time .
they knew all bits and <unk> that they needed to attack .
you know , they actually knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard about that , the <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> are kind of science .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip of this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were smart to become smart .
so after all , we were looking forward , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this is .
and then we looked at <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring them to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or <unk> .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s got to be a <unk> goal , and it has to act in iran because there &apos;s most of the infections that most of the infections are reported .
well , in this area , there are not several thousand targets .
so basically it &apos;s running out on the <unk> power of nuclear power and <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; take a list of all of the experts for <unk> and solar power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called her , and you know , you know , to compare their expertise to compare their expertise , what we found in the data and the data .
and that worked very well .
so it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the <unk> is moving inside of the centrifuge , these black objects that you see .
and if you rigged the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to crack the speed of the speed , and eventually , the centrifuge explode .
what we also found is that the goal was actually , it was slow to it , it &apos;s slowly getting slowly and <unk> in the attempt to <unk> <unk> so that they &apos;re not going to be able to go quickly .
so the big digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of looking at the data and <unk> us .
so for example , the number of <unk> is very clear out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to <unk> scientific literature , how these <unk> were built into <unk> , and found out that they are <unk> in <unk> , and each <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense of it .
and it &apos;s got better .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in <unk> .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the <unk> ?
almost identical structure .
so again , they really work well .
and this gave us big confidence that we studied .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , not just like this .
these results were reached through several weeks .
and we often put it into a <unk> and we had to see ourselves .
anyway , we found that both of the digital lectures were actually on a one and the same goal , but it &apos;s from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> the branches and slowed them down and slowed them up and slow the big <unk> loop with six <unk> in interactions .
so , in big , we &apos;re very confident , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;re actually sure what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be made by <unk> .
so here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- actually , really , i &apos;m really <unk> .
there &apos;s the gray box box , and on top you see the <unk> box .
well , what this thing is going to do is that the <unk> values of sensors -- so , for example of <unk> and <unk> -- and there &apos;s <unk> code to be the attack , with the <unk> data , goes on .
and in fact , this is the <unk> <unk> data .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> fed .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> <unk> in the control of the control .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more .
the idea is to be a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a plant station , for example , when the big <unk> becomes rapidly , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this is not going to be done by a human being done .
so this is what we need digital <unk> .
and if the threat is , then really bad things happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither is the <unk> , nor the <unk> .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so he would work just as well -- in a power station or in a power station .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be the <unk> stick over a <unk> stick , like we &apos;ve seen <unk> .
you could also use a regular diagnostic technology to get the spread .
you just need it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east for these attacks in the middle east .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most important environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we start getting better for ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was a lot of that reported that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> of it .
is it also yours ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s the <unk> involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most important superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise the problem is even bigger .
thank you for a <unk> , thank you ralph . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years that i spent in situations that normally be very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i photographed in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing to eat nothing like this to eat -- happy at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous .
in fact , i have the greatest part of my career that seemed to be involved in <unk> situations , and all this is just for trying to explore social , and hopefully it &apos;s interesting , and hopefully in a way to understand what makes them work .
so when i knew that i would come here to come in a tedtalk looking at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i was a little different .
some of you may have heard about it that i have an ad for a couple of weeks on ebay .
i sent a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the way to <unk> the <unk> of my tedtalk .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure , chris anderson will never allow a lot of content , because i &apos;m sure chris anderson is never going to allow a lot of clues to the talk .
so what you got was here : you name this : you name here : my tedtalk that you have no idea what the topic is going to be the issue , and they &apos;re going to be particularly if i could fly your ears , especially if i was stupid .
but it &apos;s time , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
now if you had asked this before one year , i would not have been able to tell you this .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i went over the course of a couple of terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be so hard and so dangerous as to these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film was funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so what &apos;s called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that all the way down to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , totally with brands that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to the film in 1946 -- forever .
and so the film is that this whole idea is looking at -- that &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more on the face .
it was &quot; forever , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to be the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;ll make sure we &apos;re going to be able to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we &apos;re going to sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever carried .
the greatest car that they &apos;re ever in danger of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink that they had ever had , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , apart from being a part of life , actually , you know , brands are part of life , actually , to finance the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to help me , if the <unk> help help .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be <unk> people .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to look at it , because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it in any case , some really famous brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we see like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think about the answer ?
the answer is probably probably &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing about the film or a hard thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... means not so optimistic .
so , my doctor , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands brands .
yeah .
when you look at the people you see it .
there are some digits that we can .
take the camera .
i thought , &quot; put the camera out of &quot; dignity that we wanted to be a <unk> .
it turned out that it meant that it meant , &quot; we want to have nothing . &quot;
and just like all the companies disappeared , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product could be so many people like that , so many people can see it .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media media and the most powerful media media -- is it not the idea that the mass of this new exciting is that the masses is it .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was this .
actually , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would be no problem at all .
that would be okay .
but what that picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re in transparency , this is what -- this is one of the first images that looks like .
i love your way sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover , and <unk> , immediately -- <unk> of <unk> and access to information , particularly , the biggest problem is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we hear a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president will say it , even our ceos .
but if it comes to the time that it &apos;s going to be implemented , it changes something .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange bear , which is still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what &apos;s going on ?
all of a <unk> foods .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started to talk to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell them this story , they said , &quot; no , we want a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father would lie to me -- and he &apos;s sitting my father in front of me -- and he &apos;s sitting looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s my version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the story .
but there &apos;s only a company , an authority willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i have john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i found that i had to do the <unk> , and i just had to go through my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a <unk> problem .
i have friends , the big ones , giant <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends , the little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , saying that the reason are so successful , why are the reason they are so successful that they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , like , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic modes of compete ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see what we see in the film ?
whenever i open up to the way , and always when i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i <unk> somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re at that point ? they &apos;re a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so , you know , maybe a little bit about this interview . &quot;
and then we have one that great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have your choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men as well as women who are equipped , <unk> , or whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can answer your questions and give them a <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as brand a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like another brands .
so these things -- you know , you know , reminds people of <unk> -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
in what words would you describe ?
we &apos;re <unk> .
this is a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that &apos;s someone under the <unk> .
we &apos;re <unk> , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh , &quot; is a super word that they really do a little bit of positive power , unlike &quot; <unk> odor and moisture moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we take them longer fresh -- better fresh , more fresh fresh fresh gas .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what &apos;s wrong with me ? what is the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man in the street that are like i , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love like beautiful clothes .
<unk> <unk> meets <unk> , except at <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is , &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like lots of black colors , lots of <unk> and stuff like that .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such stuff .
girl : if dan would be a brand , it would probably be a classic <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m like , i would say , <unk> fly .
girl 2 : part of a sudden , part of the yogi , i don &apos;t know .
boy three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i &apos;m selling <unk> in all the country &apos;s land .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was <unk> .
boy 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
a lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i see the intersection of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> helped to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for that , they could also help me .
they brought their images , yes ?
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how to deal with their thoughts and emotions about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live your life , work and so .
all these things come from and start by a place , and for me , you start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of the mind and emotions about it itself ?
it &apos;s like i like to be like .
i love things that are different .
i love things that are weird . i love things .
tell me about the &quot; why <unk> -- what do you do ?
what is the <unk> ? what &apos;s in what <unk> are you in ?
why is it important ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about it , they &apos;re not .
what else are they going through ?
... it doesn &apos;t have to be frightened . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for her .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what is going to happen .
there was a beautiful lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her <unk> two are two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand <unk> .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are just to focus on a strength , rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to be -- and this is the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re scared , they &apos;re scared , and they turn these elements into something positive , and they turn them to something positive in itself .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is an classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , <unk> , mini of a little <unk> and <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , what would you be ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? they &apos;re doing something that &apos;s blood ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s a little bit more quiet , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh as the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , <unk> , magic and <unk> .
or are you more like a <unk> ?
are you <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they designed , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like <unk> ?
are you <unk> , stable , <unk> , safe , all-powerful , holy , <unk> , and the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who are up and <unk> and <unk> , and they said they &apos;re not going to be part of the project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film because they didn &apos;t control , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 <unk> that were ready to dispense with these control that people wanted to do business with someone businesses and playful as a result to tell stories that we didn &apos;t have to tell them -- stories that would never support support .
they <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> to tell the story , as we used to tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using <unk> to the <unk> of the brain .
we went from sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no <unk> , no posters , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school in school where companies are able to go into the olympic schools , in america , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of whom i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what these tags did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with an artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him , and something completely different , something that people think is that our view is going forward .
and what was that for you ? what it does ?
well , there &apos;s the film at the <unk> film festival , we can look at this time .
according to <unk> was the first place in january , and it &apos;s got -- and it &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million movies from this film .
this is just one of two / two weeks ago .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be .
it &apos;s not even online . no <unk> .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
well , finally , the film is a very big momentum .
and this is not a bad thing for a project , which is almost every <unk> , who we were talking to their clients , the fingers .
something that i think is that if you take a chance to take your extra chance , take risks that are in these risks .
i think if you get people from it , then you &apos;re closer to them .
i think that when you &apos;re trained to his staff , the risks we get prepared to avoid a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to make risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of options that you might recognize .
after all , we should be frightened to be <unk> .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome to fear . they &apos;re welcome to risk .
each one &apos;s big , fully hot , so we &apos;re welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
nowadays , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of honesty .
and that was , with honesty , and transparency , my whole whole talk , &quot; that transparency welcome &quot; was transparency welcome by my good friends of <unk> that $ <unk> on ebay for ebay .
big data will transform for organizations all around the world in large opportunities .
<unk> presents : &quot; hot transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , this is what &apos;s going on with the $ <unk> ?
this is a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- check a check out of <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i was doing something different at google , and i <unk> to me about a little bit of museums and art <unk> that &apos;s also , gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you about 17 and 17 countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy with this slide and her access to her access .
i grew up in india .
i was given a great education for -- i don &apos;t <unk> me -- but i had a lot of museums and this artwork and this artwork .
when i was traveling and these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working on the google , i was trying to do this desire to make art more accessible to technology .
so we took a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to talk to the demonstration , and you &apos;re going to tell you some interesting things that happened for the beginning .
so you can just <unk> yourself .
you can look around in all these museums here .
this is the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , van gogh .
i &apos;m in one of my favorite at the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you &apos;re in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , mexico , doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and <unk> .
you want to get into the museum ?
and open the map , you jump with a click .
in fact , they are , they want to the end of the gangs .
just further . so much fun .
look at them .
thank you , but the best one is .
so i &apos;m standing in front of my <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the museum , let &apos;s click it .
this is now one of the images .
these are all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click on here -- but i click this way .
this is one of the images that we &apos;re using with the so-called <unk> .
this picture for example is about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can make it very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want deep in .
and so i started to play around , and i realized that there &apos;s something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to get close , and i noticed slowly that these kids actually chose something .
i wrote a little bit , i spoke to some famous famous in the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is a <unk> with a stick with a stick .
it seems to be quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
in order to go really close , you can go to the <unk> .
just to give you the <unk> , <unk> me , so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s go to the moma jump , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
at the previous example , it was about detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what happens when you want to see what van did this masterpiece , because van gogh ?
you <unk> in it . you can go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite <unk> of this slide , until i &apos;m really at the <unk> .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part of it .
every one of them , everyone -- whether rich or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
and you can create , online , you can create your own museum -- from all these pictures you can .
very simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; <unk> .
so you can give it all up to your friends , your friends , and so a conversation will start what you feel like , if you look at this image .
i think , finally , is the main thing that all the wonderful stuff here is not google .
they come from me to the museums .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience of humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be doing this digital medium medium of art , and they &apos;re <unk> online .
and this is the biggest question that i recently asked to do , &quot; do you have that to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it should add the experience .
that &apos;s about it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be in two tosses .
this is the one on the left half which is the logical side , and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a measure of scale to measure , we could visualize the brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s fully logical .
this is somebody that &apos;s fully intuitive .
now , where would you take your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have thought about one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both <unk> or so on .
you can logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , with most of the other experimental <unk> , which is a good fraction of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play and play like it . and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the things that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably a thing to be at the same time .
i mean , it may be weird to think about that one thing at the same time in two different locations , but they were not born with this idea , they have evolved .
i remember a kid to see a kid in the <unk> .
he was still a toddler and not very good at it , and he fell constantly .
but i bet that it &apos;s going to play with a very valuable lesson , which is a very valuable lesson , which is the big thing you can &apos;t just let you go .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and if they play with their particles , they &apos;re all sorts of weird things -- how they fly straight through walls , or they &apos;re at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
now , that was the physics of a few years ago , and you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
this is not like my intuition , and it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t like that often play with particles .
well , i don &apos;t play , sometimes with them , but not quite often .
and i haven &apos;t seen them yet .
i mean nobody has ever seen a particle .
but i don &apos;t like my taste .
because if all things are made out of particles and all these kinds of particles , all these particles do the rules of quantum mechanics , not just all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this is not supposed to be .
so i &apos;d like to feel like the whole thing i could feel like , if we could be able to show that , <unk> also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that it was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer chip chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
there &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to do here . we look right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of paper .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s like a springboard and it stands over the edge .
so i made this thing on a similar way to the computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all these big devices .
for the last little bit to my own machine , i had to build my own machine -- to take this as a <unk> pool of the hole and the thing .
this thing has been the ability to be in <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i was in the elevator , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people , and i listen to other things , because i &apos;m listening to all these things , because i &apos;m frankly , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are feeling like this .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not just people , but also the light that &apos;s looking at it , and the wind , and the wind that goes on to you and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal <unk> is how we had to take that piece of metal in the entire <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we have the lights off , put it into a vacuum , and <unk> the whole air , and <unk> it up to almost on the elevator , was the piece of metal free to behave like that .
so we measured his movement .
we realized that it was really weird .
instead of that , it &apos;s easy to be there , <unk> it . the way it &apos;s like <unk> was about like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
where we gave him a little push , we could be able to vibrate at the same time , and not to vibrate -- something which is just in the mechanics of quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to show you now is what &apos;s really awesome .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time , and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms are the piece of atoms coming out of atoms out the piece of metal , and at the same time they move the same atoms .
it &apos;s just <unk> , you know .
the rest of the time are they <unk> .
this is called every atom at the same time in two different places , which is the same thing that &apos;s all of the metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year into the clean room , because , check that the <unk> between one individual atom and this piece of metal is about how the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if one atom can be at the same time in two different locations , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you do it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical page is .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would you deal with it that your body is <unk> in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to design this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really <unk> objects that are in a small room .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s still more of it , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them around them , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and weird quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i have decided that we should think about economic development as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about it , where they live and work , you know , the opportunity is to pick up between at least one hand of a hand full of different cities that are all around the competition .
at the moment we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world , which is not even a single city for the benefit that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs them .
so we could see the world very simple with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new towns .
they &apos;re just doing it from homes against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in houses , this is already , but the other half are not .
they could try to expand the capacity for existing existing apartments .
but you know what you would like to do , in these homes and their environment , you know , to avoid the environment of everyone in these homes and <unk> .
so it turns out , as a very difficult , all of these kind of space .
but you could go to a completely new place , an entirely new block of building that would support the laws that would support them and support it .
so i proposed that governments are creating new spaces that have enough place for a city and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i &apos;ve found that , for example , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform .
they knew that every year has been around 75,000 <unk> <unk> their land around the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do the same thing .
at this point , <unk> <unk> , said , &quot; what happens when we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , what if we simply want a message of our country to be a part of the american embassy , part of the canadian <unk> and when people are working under the canadian rules or the ones the united states or america . &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , they suffered under severe severe <unk> .
in the next elections , the <unk> won , <unk> <unk> in a <unk> surround , both of its program , as a <unk> promised .
he was going to be <unk> <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared myself to a lecture at tedglobal .
in fact , through improving consumers , i &apos;ve been trying to use this complicated concept of the <unk> city city , which is essentially elements elements on the <unk> elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws , laws , that you can &apos;t be able to learn how to get <unk> .
we &apos;re giving new technologies , but for the progress , but for the progress , it requires technologies and laws . and they are usually the laws that help us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala , <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
he showed him <unk> .
the two call me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to our country . &quot;
so we met in december <unk> a hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear how valuable cities are how much more frequently than they cost them .
and i used to use this graph to show how precious <unk> is to a place like new york . think of that area in some cases per square meter , thousands of dollars is worth value .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion of a place when there was a <unk> discussion , &quot; paul , could we take the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk so much easier shape is that a <unk> city is a place that is the beginning of the beginning , the beginning of the country , a <unk> , which is the opportunity to choose either under these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of immigrants , who meant that we need to realize that we need to realize that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way that this is the way of our country .
i was asked to <unk> <unk> , and i was going to keep the fourth and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve given another one with an facts scientist who &apos;s given a graph like this , which is trying to prove that when you create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , <unk> , and the sketch for the new airport that was built in <unk> .
at the end of this , it has an area of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> of it , if you want to build a new city , you can start with an area of at least 1,000 .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
hi all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the head of congress came on the stage , and she said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you to your talk , but maybe we could see the tedtalk .
i have him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you have the tedtalk .
and i came to the conclusion that a new city is given to the people &apos;s new possibilities .
there was a way to live in a city that would be in peace , rather than hundreds of miles away from north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
and the executives of the government would be on the aid of <unk> on the aid of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , which they could benefit in the way of the laws for this charter and in which we could support this charter .
and the discovery of president <unk> , that the knowledge of the <unk> was about the <unk> of the foreign investors to bring this city for all the parties in honduras for many years of fear and mistrust suffering .
we &apos;re in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it takes a thousand thousand miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , you have to be in the congress for a change of the constitution of the constitution to have a <unk> policy policy in particular <unk> .
in a country that has been a terrible crisis in the congress , has been elected to be elected for these <unk> with <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
in order to be part of the constitution , it has to be twice by the congress .
on february 17th , it was a second time with <unk> <unk> .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24 of february , the delegation of about 30 levels of the world , most of them were interested in two places of the world that most of them were interested in business .
the one place is south .
this is a picture of a large , new urban city , which is built in south korea <unk> in south korea <unk> .
everything you can see in this picture was being built within four years after it took four years to get the needy .
the other place that was very challenging is singapore .
it &apos;s got two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; and you think this area for the second town .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that allows you to participate , and it &apos;s also going to be a external system .
one country has taken its supreme court to provide its supreme court for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
and also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually even get funding with one .
one thing you know , as you know , we &apos;ve got lots of <unk> .
there are many of the companies that would like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live there .
over the entire world , there are 700 million people saying that they want to live in another place to another place .
there &apos;s a million people running every year in latin america and <unk> .
many of them are fathers who are forced to be forced to sometimes their families , and sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who need enough money to eat food and clothing .
unfortunately sometimes sometimes children who are trying to find their parents , you know , in some cases , they haven &apos;t seen more since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about building a whole new city of building ?
or even <unk> of these cities , or hundreds of them all around the world ?
so what is it for an idea that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to new inhabitants ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends were asked me to tell me thanks to ted .
do you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a poll with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , the <unk> of the decisions of a day is <unk> .
and also , recently did a study of ceos called ceos in which they had a week of the ceos .
and these scientists have documented just the different themes that we documented with these ceos and how much time they were making decisions to meet with the issues .
and they &apos;ve found that the average of the ceo is a week with <unk> tasks .
each of those issues , of course , from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were making by nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their choices needed an hour or more of their time .
think about their own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine in the nine minutes is an hour in an hour ?
how good , think they &apos;re making decisions that are making decisions ?
today i want to talk today about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
well , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to give you some questions , and i want to know you some questions .
so if i ask you a question , you &apos;re going to ask you , you &apos;re just your hand when you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask them , if i ask you a question , and you answer your answer , so my first question is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very high store ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of <unk> and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we were actually drinking <unk> .
i loved it to this business , but at one time i asked myself , well , how do you come , you know ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil olive oil , including those who were locked in camps , the thousand years old .
so i decided to visit one day to visit the leader , and i asked the head , &quot; work this model that you really want to make people all these options ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of tourists who came every day and usually their cameras had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve got a little <unk> right at the entrance &apos;s entrance .
so we have six different tastes <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things , first , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i would have to stay more people ?
there are more people left , if it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what &apos;s the people who bought a glass of <unk> .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
by the people who are used to be 24 , they were only three percent actually a glass of <unk> .
by the people who are left when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually had a glass of <unk> .
well , if you do it , the people bought six times a glass of <unk> , who they had six to choice when they had 24 to choice .
now to decide not to buy a piece of glass , probably good for us -- at least , it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that it &apos;s <unk> us with very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is the resource .
i &apos;m going to describe you now a study that i <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re making decisions on the retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the entire states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> that could be a <unk> possible , the <unk> plan that will affect whether it &apos;s saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a relationship in the fact .
so , in these plans , we had about <unk> plans for the people between two to the <unk> of the new fund .
and what we found was that the more organized was offered the fact that , in fact , the participation rate .
if you look at the extremes of the extremes , the plans that two fund , had a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want to .
in the plans that &apos;s almost 60 fund , the <unk> <unk> now is about <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you could be able to participate in <unk> , if more options , even has unintended consequences .
so people who decided to participate in the people who decided that the more options were available to them , the more fulfilling it and the <unk> .
the more of them were available to them , the more options they put their whole whole money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions that someone would recommend that someone would recommend someone if their future matters .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve been observing three of the negative consequences of what we have three and more choices with themselves .
they make the decision -- they pin them , even if they &apos;re against their own best .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- poor cash and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re willing to do more things that they even feel less comfortable , even if they make it better .
and the reason this is , we might be able to enjoy these giant shelves of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we don &apos;t actually capture the comparison and isotopes and regulations , and then they can actually vote something out of that .
so what i &apos;d like to show you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve got in different ways and on various <unk> -- they can apply them in their business .
first of all .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true of real than today , that less more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , there &apos;s more and more that if they &apos;re willing to be willing to be willing , and they &apos;re going to be willing to go back , and they &apos;re going to cut the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a decline of <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the various head of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of 26 percent , you know , you &apos;ve got a percentage of sales about 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation corporation took her 10 , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- a result of the rise of the sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today are going to show you about 45,000 products .
so a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is now <unk> of the world today , is <unk> , and they &apos;re only <unk> products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world , i think i think of one of the best examples that have recently come up on the market , about the choice of the choices , was something that david <unk> has been very powerful at harvard .
every single harvard <unk> <unk> takes a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice will be 20 , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to make it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask is the staff question , &quot; tell me how options are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t grow them , they can &apos;t . &quot;
well , before we have lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience <unk> to the most beautiful road in this audience .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read them to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and i ask them to clap them , if you &apos;re willing to take <unk> &apos;s offer .
all right . everybody &apos;s willing to take gary care .
is that everybody ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i might hear more hands .
well .
the fact is that it &apos;s looking at the first time more information than the second time , but i would make it a car that it &apos;s the second time .
because the pictures made it for you .
and what &apos;s next to me about to the second technology is that they &apos;re helping with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people who understand the difference between opportunities to understand the difference between understanding what are the consequences that are associated with the individual , and these consequences are unexpected and it may seem to be .
why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more than a <unk> or a card card , if you use a <unk> or a card card ?
because it doesn &apos;t really make money .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels like , it &apos;s a very good tool for you to save more .
so we did in a study that i made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people at <unk> -- and these people were working in a gathering in which they had their participation for their <unk> .
and during those meetings , we &apos;ve just like these places exactly how they always have , we have a little .
the thing that we had to have <unk> was that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in the course we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation in the participation of 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people that were willing to save , or a increase in order to pay for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can better with more categories than using more choices .
here &apos;s an example , for example , we &apos;ve done in a <unk> <unk> .
it turns out , it turns out that it &apos;s going to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> up in the northeast , the number of <unk> different kinds of magazines up until <unk> .
but you know what ?
so if i show you 600 magazines and you put them in 10 categories of <unk> , or i showed them to show 400 magazines , and those in 20 categories , then they believe that i had more selection and a better <unk> than i had to give you 600 .
because the categories can tell me how i can .
these are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and &quot; the other is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left is <unk> , and the ad on the right is -- you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think the one on the left is jazz , and you &apos;re on the right hand , you &apos;ll clap .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories need to say something called the choice .
and this problem is often when you look at the long points of all this .
who do you really want to know ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s make a very , very complicated decision .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely <unk> .
you &apos;ve got to make 62 different decisions to design their car .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that make them a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i was 56 .
engines , you get four possibilities .
so what i &apos;m doing is i &apos;m going to change the order in the choices .
half of the clients is going to go from many ways , <unk> <unk> to the low opportunities .
so the other half of the clients are about the worse possibilities , four pathways that <unk> 56 , many ways .
what i &apos;m looking at ?
how are they interested .
if you use the <unk> decision to make the decision , that they &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find out is that the people who go from many of the many things are always going to go over and over and over again .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choice to the very many , they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order of change in this information is presented .
if i start to start with the simple approach , i &apos;m learning .
even though you choose the gears , i don &apos;t choose anything about my preferences in the field , it &apos;s still getting still to pick it up .
it makes me a lot of excitement about the big product that i <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to make interest .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told them by four techniques that the problem of <unk> <unk> -- they &apos;re going to be the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- they do better ; we can do better with more categories , less possibilities .
so every one of these techniques that i &apos;m going to show you today is to help them the possibility -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who are making service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in the selection .
and the more we pick up , the better we are going to be able to practice better .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i &apos;m looking at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are <unk> , and then then why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be <unk> -- <unk> , singers , comedians -- when i was a young , it seemed so an infinite hard .
but we &apos;ve allowed that we all , or all of our creative talent will be famous for us , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours video video per minute .
it &apos;s going to only one tiny percentage of ever <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be thousands of times and so the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> of this video that he had shot in front of his house in yosemite national national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer .
actually , don &apos;t want to make a viral video .
he just wanted to share a <unk> .
because you &apos;re just like this , if you <unk> <unk> <unk> .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually sent to january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video took the video last request .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , let &apos;s ask new things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
rebecca <unk> <unk> is one of the popular videos of the year .
it was nearly 200 million times .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; seems to be there .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday .
if you want to know about it , these other spikes are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular ?
well , <unk> <unk> on , many blogs started to write about this .
michael <unk> : <unk> science theater theater was one first thing to twitter on twitter .
so what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> is a place of a place , with a large audience , with a large audience shared with this process .
and then this community was formed by people who shared these big <unk> shared , and they started talking about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> . &quot;
already in the first seven days , it was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the 20th conversation of the 20th century , the part of the 20th century is part of the community that &apos;s going to become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s it just .
this year was nearly 50 million times .
and if you think it &apos;s crazy , you know , that there &apos;s been a <unk> there that has been looked at four million times .
even cats can look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
so what &apos;s important is the creativity that is in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody has made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
all the <unk> shot out of the floor that it &apos;s made of a silly joke that we all participate in .
now , we don &apos;t know how to do something we do with .
who would have all of that ?
who would have &quot; the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; or google black or <unk> <unk> ?
what you could do is you could write your write , which is something like that ?
in a world where every minute two days of video uploaded it uploaded , just unique unique and unexpected as the previous video described video .
i &apos;m going to admit , i wasn &apos;t interested in my interest when i said a friend , and i &apos;m supposed to look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york for parking traffic .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not standing on the <unk> threats , but often there &apos;s a disability that doesn &apos;t really get out to the <unk> .
because this was completely surprising and humorous , casey became casey <unk> , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do .
and this is all going to lead us to the big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , totally unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to the audience and in the audience .
as i said , one of the currently biggest stars -- justin beaver -- made his beginning to youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas to your ideas .
and today , we &apos;re feeling as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re not going to make a lot of the media from today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the discussion between women over three minutes , and how the amazing strength of this connection is to live in a four year-old girl , when she was about 30 years with her little <unk> in a little boat in the national ocean and never disappeared before over 30 years with her little boat in a little boat .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s another <unk> .
i want to tell you some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece of : a man who is burning his life .
it &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who was full of the whole life of unity of unity of unity and freedom of his home .
if you hold him in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> eyes , like it has to admit that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> now .
he moved into silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother has never forgotten me .
i had to worry that it was not for free to it , and it was my job to learn that the story was true to us , we were .
the next <unk> shows , like a boat in the early <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
my mom was 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , two little girls .
for her life , she had a challenge : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely keen to fail .
after a high school and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat on the lake , as <unk> .
all the adults were conscious .
the greatest fear was she had <unk> , rape and death .
like most of the adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> .
and at one point , my sister had only got my sister and i , and then , her grandmother and my grandmother .
my first memories are coming from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the motor , the <unk> one every wave on the front bar , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , the many times came , but the <unk> of the men on the boat would make up the boat , or the <unk> of the motor that didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights in front of the coast of the coast , and the young man who broke up , and he died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first one that was too much for him .
no apple ever had no apple again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations to build a new life .
we went down in <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , there were no <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came out of the rest of the world .
and the <unk> of the <unk> were caused by people who shared one thing together : they started new .
my mom was working on farms , then on a line of <unk> , six days , six layers of <unk> .
it &apos;s managed to find out english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every one dollar has been given , and became in other words for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for that , most of the time , the new things that come from all the time .
two couple of <unk> for the school , every one in order to cover the holes at the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to do six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; and there : &quot; <unk> , goes home . &quot;
go home where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was an meeting to the reconciliation and an quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to you . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mom was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other of our day , and listened to the motions of our grandmother .
my mom suffered from the boat .
and it was my job , every night awake , until her <unk> came , i could <unk> her .
she opened a <unk> , made a <unk> and a store .
and the women came with their stories over men who are not <unk> , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsor were looking for .
<unk> centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , who made a <unk> demand for himself .
in the other , i was in <unk> life , the tragic wave of violence carrying up the tragic and the <unk> .
but so many of them got over the years .
and because of this help , i was in my last year of <unk> as a young <unk> of the year .
and i got from a <unk> to the next , and the <unk> didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was <unk> le , refugee and social activist that had never heard of the places that she had never heard , and in houses that would never have heard .
i was not familiar with this .
i didn &apos;t know how to use it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into the class and the convenience of life of an unknown <unk> back -- a grandmother , a mom and two daughters , who were telling each other for their day , and <unk> , we still fall in the same bed .
i told my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do this .
she reminded me that i was so old as it was when we had the boat .
no , no way .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the clash of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more time i spoke , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , they were in the borders of the possible .
and even though i graduated from my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t make myself a career in <unk> .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a musician , a <unk> , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the <unk> .
because it can make it easy for the <unk> of the <unk> , can mean that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i went out enough to know enough to know that , the world <unk> , but not as much as you <unk> it .
possibilities that were not allowed to have been resolved .
there was an energy , an optimism optimism , an optimism of the humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut .
i collected a little team of people around me to the <unk> , &quot; not &quot; a <unk> challenge .
a year , we had no cents .
at the end of a <unk> , i took a huge <unk> soup that we shared .
we worked to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to the united states .
after just a journey there .
my gut self .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure went on .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local <unk> is the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died in front of her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
at age 17 , she was the second woman of a forger , her mother .
no of the support of her husband , she was worried for a <unk> , by taking him in front of trial and <unk> in their own case , and another greater <unk> than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t be an <unk> .
i was just <unk> in a hotel room , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked at the <unk> and saw them on the other side .
i knew that she was coming to .
my mother phoned me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a temple temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk> .
we told her stories and <unk> her , that we were still in .
at midnight , the monk came and said , he &apos;s got to close the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she hold them in tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t . &quot;
if there is a band in our family , it &apos;s just through the women .
and you see who we were , and how life evolved us , we can now see that the men that might come in our lives , we &apos;d be used to the <unk> .
the defeat would be simply .
now , i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever be a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m scared of privilege , <unk> <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave of <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the motor , the vast horizon , which is nothing wrong ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that , and you could make it safe , i would do it .
and also , <unk> mother is today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because , of course , this is an image that you can &apos;t take with his camera .
and yet my interest in photography , when i was my first digital camera , at age 15 years old .
i put it with my former <unk> , but it was a little bit different , because the camera was using the camera in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about to go to the right place to be the right place at the right time .
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s going to start when it &apos;s going to cause the trigger .
photos like this : a <unk> along a lot of <unk> street .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and still , a realistic level .
or photos like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all of the shared desire to keep an realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something that you can really , but i want to look like this , as if you could have this , you know , on a photograph .
photos that you have to think about a brief moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s really about to capture an idea , as a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how to interpret the world on a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is for realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i &apos;m looking at it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and recombine to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three , three of physical objects that we all identify in a three-dimensional world in three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , you can combine something that is actually creating something that &apos;s still looked at , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we <unk> our brains , because our brain is not really making sense .
and i see the same process in order by taking pictures .
it &apos;s really just about different realities .
so the things that look like a look like a realistic image , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about it in our daily life .
but if we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they look at it .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to obey a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
and then you combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that we should have pictures the same way .
secondly , photos have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures are these two assets , and they &apos;re fired out of the same height and the same <unk> .
third is it &apos;s about it , it &apos;s impossible to make it possible , where the individual images will start and end by creating it seamlessly .
it &apos;s not possible to say how the photo was made .
so by using color , contrast and contrast to the edges of these individual images , photographic <unk> , like <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the boundaries between the various images and let them look like a single picture of a <unk> basically .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s just a landscape that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part is being manipulated .
this picture is actually completely composed , from pictures of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place to create a place where a place , because you don &apos;t have to make trade-offs with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan to plan them to find these different places for the pieces of the jigsaw .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the bank comes from another place .
the <unk> came from a quarry .
and yes , i went to the house on the island red <unk> to make it <unk> .
so to make a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s actually from me to <unk> .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very well planned .
and if you make good footage , the result is pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so these are all the tools there are there , and the only thing that is to us , is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to the <unk> is to make a <unk> .
it &apos;s not particularly a scientific scientific -- she &apos;s making a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient , families , relatives , , &quot; like this ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems that all -- maybe the most of the electronic <unk> fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i jump .
and yes , i have a job , as you recognize .
i have my job for 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i get into the scale , you send my data to google health .
and there &apos;s also going to be <unk> by my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need to help you , or that &apos;s a glimpse of the past .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with the 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i turn on my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , rather than a little salad , <unk> . &quot;
but this is what &apos;s going to happen , which can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
it could also be used to people to get people out of their chairs , and they get them together to play together some kind of game to control their health .
next week comes up to the market .
it will give this little <unk> that you &apos;re at an iphone or so <unk> .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to send it to your doctor and to send it to the other , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patient will come into the game , and they can &apos;t just take control of control , the captain on their own ship , but can also help us in the health of the health care of the challenges that are going to be in front of us , and the public health rate , and so on .
do they make it easy to use the light and start them to hug patients in a team .
and they can reach through these kinds of ways , but also through .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we all know exactly where all these are atms around <unk> .
we know one where all the gas gas is .
and we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next <unk> was in the moment .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where it &apos;s when he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes it is <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> have been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we have a <unk> approach .
we have developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone , you can , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , you can do your iphone , and within the next few weeks , their lives can save the lives of life .
and we don &apos;t want this to just <unk> this as <unk> as the product , but also as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us how to help us behave behavior in order to crowdsource these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s your own blood <unk> or somebody else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all around us to do is that companies are going to help us in the <unk> world .
this could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still <unk> .
and please help us and try to improve the health of health care just something , but in the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to make us protect the environment , by doing ...
... it &apos;s <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it until it is .
now , we can just skip it -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a few years ago , i started a program to set up the stars in technology and design a year , and working in a environment that &apos;s pretty much what they really do , we have to work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> for the geeks .
we &apos;re going to vote every year , and we let them work with <unk> work .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in <unk> .
and there were great apps where they were working with urban collaborators .
but what you really do is to show is what &apos;s happening today .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s <unk> him when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> .
how did he came to look at this particular way ?
and we had a team last year of birth in boston , in the process of the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of february .
and they realized that the city was never going into this fire hydrant .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , who realized another thing and that was that the heads of sidewalks were free to <unk> , right before that parts .
so he did what everyone was going to do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> to him free , if it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that you &apos;ve written in last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other .
it &apos;s going to be expanding .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> division of the city , <unk> the city <unk> , which is that he could use this app , not for snow , but for that citizens , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but the people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to check them .
and then , seattle seattle , the app used to use to use the citizens to clean the <unk> .
and chicago is just introduced to the people who &apos;s <unk> when it <unk> <unk> .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and she &apos;s being distributed , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s usually not going to happen .
the <unk> of software takes a few years .
we had a team that last year on a project in boston , it was working for three people .
it was about a way to figure out with the parents who are the right public schools for the right public schools .
we &apos;ve been told later that if it would go over the normal channels , it would take over two years and it would spend over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not yet .
now , there &apos;s a project right now in the silicon valley , which is the cost for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then we can spread from <unk> , a kind of shot in front of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private companies , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important about this app is that they &apos;re represented a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now , there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to create things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; the code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all around the country who are getting up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t stop the government .
they &apos;re so frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about they fix them .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you &apos;re all your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things that we forget about is the government , the core , in the nucleus of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do is we do not alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , you know , you &apos;re because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally makes their power of us -- <unk> , &quot; we &apos;re people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought it was mainly in the government to vote in a office .
well , after two years , i went to the conclusion that it &apos;s in the community , in front of the community .
this is the call for service and information .
they come out , you get out in your town in your town .
if you ever want to have the chance to work in your <unk> call , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you do all -- you will see that people , the government , the government for a lot of different problems , including that &apos;s a <unk> in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open up all the doors in your house , and you see a lot of music , and see , if you see that ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but this was not the end of the <unk> .
in boston , it &apos;s not just a call call .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- that &apos;s an actual report -- this is an actual <unk> -- i can &apos;t say if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what &apos;s called &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is happening .
scott <unk> himself to man .
but in the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s all the way you can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next thing that we have received was , &quot; i went over there , i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
the <unk> on the site . went home .
good afternoon , sweet <unk> .
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i mean , not necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citizen helped a different citizens , but the government was played here in a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have to connect them with the government , if they were needed , but a neighbor is a way better and cheaper , cheaper to government services .
when a neighbor helps , we need our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think is that the government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that &apos;s our contribution to the system .
how many times we have chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy being used to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going back to us , and we expect the government , our values , our values , and then no much changed ?
this is because the government is like a rising , and politics are the top <unk> .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call the bureaucracy .
and we use this word with these words .
but it &apos;s this kind of weird thing that we own , and we pay for it to be something that &apos;s working on us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work , we have to make it sexy sexy .
because this is where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to respond to the power of government .
so the <unk> did .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens that has written a very detailed report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not politically active , this is <unk> active .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you need to ask .
do we really believe that we have to do what we need to do without an institution to improve the name of all of us ?
government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government &apos;s fundamental <unk> in a way that can actually reach something to the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown <unk> &apos;s internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build it right .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m sorry , unfortunately , nearly one generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with it , their voice for granted .
they don &apos;t fight the battle that we all fight , who are going to talk about ; they all need to talk .
you can do your mind , everyone in every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of the government , they don &apos;t care about their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that work improves the government .
and these apps that lets us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be , a fire hydrant , weeds , weeds <unk> , a trash trash with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have these that fire hydrant all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories , we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government who pay pay for them , who are paying for them .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government , until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all here is : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , we will be a lot of voices , or we &apos;re going to be a bunch of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in it is to explain to people like this wonderful new technologies that are going to be , and i was thinking back to the friends and understand what &apos;s really quickly about , i would like to tell you what i really think .
so i &apos;m going to start to show you a short , boring slide .
... if you &apos;ll just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen to happen by my <unk> .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather the details shape .
and this slide shows data from an analysis of us through the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area .
so the interesting thing here is that this slide is , as many other , which we often find in our field , a kind of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the <unk> <unk> .
and this is an novelty that we need this type of scale on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
another thing , because i &apos;m going to draw something like this paper .
now , why do we draw from the technology on <unk> curves ?
the reason that is , if i draw it on a normal chart , where we &apos;re saying , this is the years , so the time is a kind of , and this is an example of the technology that i want to make with a graph , is silly .
so they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , and then it would be <unk> on the <unk> scale , in a flat line .
but if something like here is happening here , then this is the <unk> situation .
so , if the <unk> <unk> so quickly as the <unk> advances , we could get <unk> into a taxi , and in 30 seconds we were in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not so fast .
this was never before in the history of the <unk> , that sort of <unk> growth , which is the equivalent of all the few years exponentially .
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever and forever , as fast as now .
there are two ways .
either it will be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s it in about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is something like this .
is that really , then , we &apos;re here right now at the moment in the transition right now .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world to a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new condition that makes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the inside .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and the people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
let &apos;s go ahead and not .
so in other words , the future of every year has been since i have since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason that we realize is that there is something that &apos;s underway .
it &apos;s going to happen . we can do it all .
and we know that there &apos;s no way to try to make sense , or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now .
i want to talk about what that could be , this transition in which we are currently .
so to make this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really nothing with technology or computers .
because i think really about this , we need to go back to a step back and look at this thing on a time .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at this on earth &apos;s life .
i think the big picture makes sense , if you <unk> it into a few <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is about two billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with a lot of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they <unk> the chemicals .
and i think there &apos;s theories that we &apos;re starting to understand how all the things with rna started , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit a bit of a story of what &apos;s going on at that time , which are different types of chemicals for chemicals .
some of these strands contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and so grow .
all the way they were starting to do .
these little <unk> were in the sense of the <unk> <unk> .
however , this is not about living in the sense , because every single one was just a little , a little , <unk> prescription of chemicals .
and every time , if it was divided out , there are <unk> chemicals in there .
so each other is slightly different .
in fact , the knights templar , which is a <unk> for growth <unk> faster than others and integrated more and more and more chemicals from the outside and shared .
so these tended to survive longer , and they tend to survive in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , it &apos;s more interesting if this <unk> is a trick over an abstraction .
in fact , there &apos;s a kind of which we don &apos;t fully understand , have this <unk> capacity of the ability to do information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe from the cell to store a information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you &apos;ve got in this <unk> , evolutionary way of a way that allowed them to , what they were doing is that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing is that this sort of information is to store this sort of information over the time of two billion years where they came in , right ?
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same .
and in fact , every living organism is exactly the same letters and the same thing .
we &apos;re at that point that we &apos;re just going to write , just to the <unk> of the code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m in airports in the airports of <unk> .
in fact , what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken these code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna and 10 ^ 22 times .
so if you want to someone a hundred million copies of my <unk> <unk> , i have enough for everyone in this room and even in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was a <unk> reality , i would have you to put it on a virus and into the space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , very interesting , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s starting to communicate these cells and information that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
this is also the reason why the persistence grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and they have these information combined with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are <unk> on penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
so this communication would allow the reasons of communities , which in some sense were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either have either survived together , or they went together under that . that meant that if a community had been successful , every individuals of the community and the evolution of evolution .
so the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to the communities for the whole community in a <unk> on the whole way to write the dna .
and the next stage stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of a lot of <unk> <unk> , which are together as an individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that don &apos;t have any more on themselves .
your skin cells are <unk> without heart cells , muscle cells , and so on .
so these communities started <unk> , so that the level that evolution was happening was no longer the individual cell , but the whole <unk> thing we call .
so the next step is now within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that can &apos;t do anything else as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built these <unk> .
they started specialists in specialists within the community , special structures that are responsible for learning , understanding and that information of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary benefit .
because at that point an individual -- learn an individual -- learning within the time of life &apos;s lifespan , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so an organism could not eat , for example , not to eat a certain fruit because they were bad and sick , the last time he ate her .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of one organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , because of that information , because that information had to learned from the individuals , which were because of those fruits , there were nowhere .
so the nervous system has been the <unk> in this particular <unk> , because evolution could happen now within an individual .
she could take place within a time .
what happened after that , that the individual organisms have a way to communicate with each other .
once , as an example , the <unk> of us is familiar with the human version of these <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
and i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;ll give notes , basically <unk> notes from me to create a similar <unk> idea in your head that has some sort of resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns it into sounds , a sequence of sound , and creating something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as an individual organism .
and what we actually did is we think of the human being , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages stages , which <unk> <unk> through -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data on the data .
the invention of the language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computer , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on these <unk> mechanisms that we built in our community to deal with this information .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we were so far .
so nowadays evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a <unk> little <unk> where he saw a little evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so we have the <unk> again .
the first step of story that i told you , <unk> a billion years a billion years .
the next steps , how the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , they seem few decades .
so the process is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word -- if something is its <unk> .
the more it changes the faster .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process of itself .
i live professionally from the building of computers , and i know that i made the mechanism that i use to build computer , not using computers recently in the computer .
so my current exercise is to design objects with such a powerful complication , that it &apos;s impossible to me to design this in a traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the <unk> are doing .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
what i do instead of doing instead , which is also the designers of thinking <unk> , is , we think of a certain <unk> , <unk> of the machine and the machine does something that we extend our ability to extend better .
and it &apos;s part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
so , a way which is particularly interesting , and which i often have used recently , is evolution itself .
we put a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on inside the <unk> .
in order to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program , which is made of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , 93 hundred million randomly selected sequences of instructions .
now , please run this randomly chosen chosen to take all the programs , and pick up all the programs , which are mine . &quot;
so in other words , i guess what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort of a number of example that would be a simple example of what i used to do .
so these are the programs that are most likely to move numbers .
now , of course , the chance of random chosen is the chance you &apos;re in random numbers , you &apos;re not going to won &apos;t the fact that we won &apos;t actually make the fact that .
but one of those things like two are two numbers in the right order of the right order .
now , i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that are supposed to my <unk> .
they store that off , <unk> the rest .
now , all of the <unk> that are the numbers for the best .
and that &apos;s a kind of technique that &apos;s called <unk> . &quot;
take two programs , and they create children through the exchange of <unk> , and the kids are <unk> the properties of the <unk> of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that are developed by creating combinations of programs that are slightly closer to the <unk> than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them again .
there might be some mutations .
and try to try and another generation .
all these generations need very few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases for a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can be perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever heard of hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how to work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s weird and weird programs .
but they do work .
i know , i &apos;m sure that they &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that come in the job .
because their life depended on whether they did the job .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , <unk> , he <unk> a map of <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , &quot; this plane is made of <unk> <unk> , which is working together in order to make their flight secure . &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal , if it &apos;s too complicated .
so let &apos;s start to rely on the computer , for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
it allows us to make things with a much more powerful complexity than it would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the opportunity .
so <unk> <unk> technology technology .
so we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re capable of creating these processes that are able to perform faster .
so it comes a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be as confusing .
because all of these new technologies are fed by themselves .
we &apos;re going off .
we &apos;re at a point of view , the analog is at the time , as a <unk> evolved .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really see what the hell we &apos;re doing is actually .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after something else comes .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> to tell us that we &apos;re evolution in evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of the creation of whatever &apos;s next .
well , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here now before i &apos;m going to <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the <unk> desert with <unk> <unk> .
we talked about it that has nothing changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel back to the time , we went into a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
at the time , as the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a arch , took a shot , fired in the floor and water .
now we do this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic of machines were replaced by machines .
that was really sad .
i got a little scared of technology .
i was scared that i could lose the ability to make the <unk> , the <unk> , and no tweet about my friends .
i found that technology can make magic possible .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships , and i think of my imagination .
so , i think it was so before us to make our email clocks and raise cameras .
they thought we were inspired by being inspired .
and so i went to the world of the technology to see how i could use them to help magic instead rather than killing .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device for storytelling to storytelling the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it bring pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
that storytelling is always needed more senses .
but what do we do that ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> an interactive ipad .
here &apos;s : &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s : &quot; this box is &quot; i write my name .
and it &apos;s going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad is white where i live -- i live -- i &apos;m <unk> .
the kid in me is really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
so i &apos;m not a magician , and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found always quite exciting .
so you have to blow the ipad out of the ipad and the fireflies <unk> .
and the light goes through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy in one galaxy in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s every book , and every world , a little bit of <unk> that i put here to the magic device in the device .
and this is a map .
<unk> had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s an orientation in the rest of the book .
it also shows another question of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s important to make something important , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard about <unk> and <unk> <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> in <unk> trapped in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history for children .
a story about new issues , like the <unk> <unk> .
the theme of the last 10 years , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their <unk> in the <unk> of their computer .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search for you . you need to go out and see the camera pictures of natural objects .
as a kid , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this is <unk> <unk> . you need to go out to a chapter in a chapter of a flower from a flower and tag .
in another chapter you have to get a piece of <unk> and tag .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photographs that actually took it .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of magic to connect the world and technology .
so in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction with the video of the ipads and the <unk> reality of the ipads and through <unk> reality animation , which is a plant of <unk> .
at one hand , the screen <unk> with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , and you can read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology comes into technology and in magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , and the magic , and the love of our childhood was very simple .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons , or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the most elemental of my time with the social weakest and in places where there &apos;s a lot of brazilians .
here at ted to be able to see and to hear , how stark this , i have a lot of power .
in short periods of time , i &apos;ve got a identity . ted has a identity .
you can tell things that the world &apos;s influence .
and sometimes when it comes to something about ted , it gets a meaning and strength that it wouldn &apos;t .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of the teacher may have meaning , but the words of a <unk> teacher are meaningful .
as a physician , you can do good , as a <unk> doctor , you can still do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was a big family in a family , a traditional household household , who was dominated by a <unk> dominated , and this was <unk> my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had to be .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the origin of many disputes in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was a lot , but she was loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
she pushed me so that i could barely breathe . let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel still my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she <unk> me again . if i said , &quot; yes , let me go in .
she was something that you always wanted to be in her .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins fell around everywhere .
i remember , i need to have eight or nine or nine living that i woke up in the morning , and all my cousins fell around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> and looking at me .
first , i thought that would be a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she &apos;d come up and came over and came over and came over and she said , &quot; come , <unk> . you need to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me out of out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to promise you a little promise you need it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
she sat down , and i looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i will never forget that .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , <unk> .
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all the time , you know , you &apos;re always going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you , you always care about them . &quot;
my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , i promise it . &quot;
after all , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is &quot; you never alcohol alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , i promise . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural , rural , i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day came my brother home , and he brought my brother home with his sister and me and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just sitting there &apos;s just like this .
and then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister to one , and she took them , and then they offered me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . just ok . i don &apos;t want beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do we do that . now , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what she was like , your sister had a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do you . just do you . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , <unk> . &quot;
and then he looked at my face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t do you &apos;re still crazy for the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the children that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i shouldn &apos;t do it .
this is probably going to be <unk> .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i <unk> that i never had a drinks , alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that , because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s <unk> .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people to tell us things that they don &apos;t .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in the prison prison prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we need to take care .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today , there &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states have the highest <unk> of the world today .
seven million people are <unk> on the <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , our world is fundamentally changing our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population of the population , despair , hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison prison , in prison , on the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities , from los angeles over the country -- from los angeles over philadelphia over philadelphia over philadelphia -- are 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men in prison in prison , in prison , or <unk> .
our system is not just being driven by the questions that we have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s powered by poverty .
we have a <unk> in this country that makes them much better when they are rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affected the outcome .
still , we seem to be satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the face .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> developments .
my hometown of alabama is going to get rid of the <unk> when they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and today , in alabama today , 34 percent of the male population is lost in alabama .
we <unk> that in 10 years , the average of the <unk> of the world &apos;s life is going to be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , which is <unk> children to death in prison .
in this our country , there are children with children &apos;s <unk> <unk> without <unk> .
we have a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we believe , because you &apos;ve taught it that the real question is : has a man deserves to die for one of the <unk> crimes of crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other way is not : is someone for a crimes of death , but we have to make it , kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty is defined in america .
so on nine people we &apos;ve been executed , we get one that we &apos;ve got for granted , who was <unk> and made of death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly somebody with an airplane fly , if for nine planes , the floor , one .
but somehow we do it , we <unk> ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we kill that .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students , african history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , which is at the time at the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the men in this country , there was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be scared before .
or before bombs .
it was the terror terror who shaped her life .
these elders people come to me and say , &quot; mr mr <unk> , they talk , they &apos;re going to tell the talks that we &apos;re supposed to stop saying that we should stop in the history of our nation with terrorism . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and several decades of <unk> motivated <unk> and apartheid .
and yet there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t talk to about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in historical context .
we put them all the time .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s been hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> don &apos;t overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in that our country .
i took some talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death .
and of course , it can never give them more . &quot;
it &apos;s got a silence . then she said a woman with our story , that we &apos;ve ever been impossible to do this again for people to do this again .
it would be <unk> of us , and it would be <unk> and <unk> people .
i thought about it .
what it would be like to be in a world where the german state of the german state people were made of <unk> , especially if they were <unk> lots of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re killing people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , 11 times higher , if the victim knows black is , if the victim knows black , and the victim knows -- in the same states .
and yet there is this mental <unk> .
i think that &apos;s our identity .
if we don &apos;t deal with the deal of these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these <unk> <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
it seems to me .
because we talk about that we need more of hope , more engagement , more dedication to the complex world .
for me , this is the time to think about this time and talk about the poor , the <unk> that will never be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own life .
we all need to believe the last thing we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so , we &apos;re rational , so we &apos;re so much .
innovation , creativity , and not just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s the <unk> that i think it is , it &apos;s not just open for all the <unk> and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> of politicians once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but what we needed most of , was hope , an intellectual orientation , the willingness to be <unk> , sometimes in <unk> places . &quot;
these mental orientation is the core of what i think is that the <unk> must be involved .
there &apos;s no way of it to technology and design that allows us to be fully human , as long as we don &apos;t even have eyes and ears , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is much more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she will touch it .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the big privilege to meet the pink parks .
mrs. parks once came back to <unk> , where they were two of their oldest friends of the old women , <unk> <unk> that had been initiated the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , white king <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk>
so these women were going to come up and just <unk> .
and so , and then i called a woman <unk> myself and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; mrs. parks is coming in the city . we want to talk about .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m listening . &quot;
and i went over and just heard .
it was always so inspiring .
one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , i turned to myself , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what is the initiative for the same is right .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
<unk> people want to help , who were convicted of innocent .
we want to bias bias and discrimination in the <unk> fight .
we don &apos;t want to <unk> <unk> without any <unk> for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman <unk> <unk> <unk> to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you must be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted ted should be <unk> .
we need to be able to ask these challenges , these problems , that suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity is about our humanity .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i learned a few simple things .
we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone doesn &apos;t take something that &apos;s not heard , it &apos;s not just a <unk> .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s so , there is a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , we don &apos;t end up at the end of our technology , not for the things that we &apos;re developing .
ultimately , a society is not measured how they do their rich and powerful and powerful and privileged , but it &apos;s how they deal with the arms , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in that context , we &apos;re starting to understand the amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . it &apos;s a story .
sometimes i urge you too .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas , our ideas of thinking , in very important ways .
i <unk> these children who were very hard <unk> .
i &apos;m going to go into <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and they &apos;re supposed to be as an emergency player .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can someone turn somebody into something that &apos;s not about ?
the judge looks like him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long , and i thought my god , if a judge can turn into something different , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish to you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think i was able to work better , i started to work .
i had a <unk> , poor black boy than clients .
and i started with this . the headline said , &quot; wow , my poor , <unk> black inmates like a privileged , white , white , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in my judgment , i explained to the <unk> of the <unk> and the police and <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that country in this country , nothing more <unk> is that it &apos;s just an <unk> .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was that crazy judgment just dreamed or him .
and i didn &apos;t just wrote it to my horror , but also to court court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
so , after all , i decided , my god , i have to put in the court and this crazy case .
i went to the car and was really overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that it &apos;s going to hard so painful .
after all , i went out of my car , and the stairs went to court .
when i was the staircase on the court , there was a elderly , black man , who &apos;s black man on court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he put me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud . &quot;
and i have to say it gave me force .
it was a very deep deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute to each one of the ability to contribute to a community of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge showed me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have these crazy scripts ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people come in , just because they were angry .
i was written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
it was the <unk> of the <unk> of people who had been angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i looked at the janitors and go off .
he looked back through the window , and i could hear all the <unk> .
he went down and off .
after all , this older black man came along with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat straight behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge was a pause .
and during a break , a <unk> in the <unk> , which was meant that the <unk> was in <unk> .
this <unk> ran across the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to be here to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this young man . don &apos;t give it out .
i came to ted , because i think many of you have been understood that the moral monkey of the universe is far in the universe , but it &apos;s the justice system of justice .
we don &apos;t have evolved as humans , unless we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that all of our survival is surviving every single connected .
that we think our visions of technology and design , by entertainment and creativity and creativity .
and most of all , i &apos;d like to see those of you who just see this , just don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give you .
you have this audience , this community , that community , you saw a obvious wish to help and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there is a <unk> in this spring in this spring , where it comes to a effort , is something about the <unk> , something that will happen in politics .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars for the <unk> <unk> a billion dollars for death .
and yet , <unk> percent of all odds are not equipped with a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> don &apos;t come in court .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this is going to suggest that money should make money into more secure and security .
i think there is opportunities .
over the last three decades , the u.s. <unk> has been huge .
this is a fact that they often put in a relationship with the <unk> <unk> .
what would you say someone who believes ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> don &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really know at the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> .
so the dramatic numbers are high numbers in prison .
we have <unk> <unk> from the rhetoric of the rhetoric .
now , we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which people used to get behind the grid , for a <unk> , for the theft of good good , rather than that you force them to give it back .
i think we need to do more , to help people who become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think that our current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve really got an string of <unk> .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is a <unk> <unk> with himself .
two : famine . three : famine , o.c. police .
four : malignant <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : social accidents : social decline .
8 : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . mass destruction .
recession . <unk> . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips that i collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media will prefer to show us to negative issues , because our minds are precisely these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second day , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process much more information .
and because nothing more important than our survival is the first time for all the information to all the information , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> , our <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> all the information for the <unk> of the environment in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very true .
well , with all of our digital devices that &apos;s week for us seven days , 24 hours a day of all these negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic pessimistic pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s going to be worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century that we &apos;ve been done in the last century through a series of forces that it &apos;s so strong that it &apos;s going to be possible for us to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- the climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at the problems of a very long time , problems in a very long way , but they finally overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can make the progress .
over the last hundred years , the average lifespan has more than doubled the average lifespan of the population of the population has tripled .
child mortality has halved .
and this is the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re currently in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> is the <unk> in the last 130 years of 25 percent at 80 percent .
we live in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we extend our expectations on the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve defined poverty .
remember a big percentage of americans that live under the poverty of poverty , access to electricity , toilets , <unk> , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of earth could never be able to dream like this .
the foundation for many of these things are creating technologies , and they &apos;re growing <unk> .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to lead to the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and it &apos;s going to double doubling for 12 to 24 .
this is about the mobile phone in your purse about a million times less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law &apos;s law .
notice two things on this curve .
first , what &apos;s going on -- in good like , in good , war or peace , recession or peace , recession and <unk> .
and this is the result of the faster computers that we &apos;re building faster .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our big problems .
and also , despite their logarithmic <unk> on the left , it goes up .
so the rate itself is accelerating .
and on this graph , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available all available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that &apos;s my friends in autodesk , and sensors and networks , robots , robots , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , digital medicine , <unk> biology , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> supercomputer , <unk> supercomputer , &quot; jeopardy ? &quot;
that was a big .
i took the newspaper <unk> , and after the best headlines , i could find that .
i love this : &quot; watson of human adversaries . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about to understand the middle of the language .
so imagine that this artificial intelligence every owner would be a <unk> available .
four years ago ray kurzweil and i &apos;m here at ted , at ted , singularity , <unk> .
and we bring our students all these technologies , with focused focus on how this could be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services within a decade to create a life of billions of people .
think about this , that a group of students can influence life from billions of students today .
30 years ago , this is ridiculous .
today we can have made that dozens of companies that have made that happen .
if i think of that surplus , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to me to make a living of a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about <unk> goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 1700s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he &apos;s got the king of <unk> dinner dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> <unk> , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> , however <unk> .
aluminum was at this time , the most valuable metal on the planet , more than gold and <unk> .
this is the reason why the dome made made of aluminum .
well , although aluminum is <unk> percent of the <unk> , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed and made it so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet with <unk> more energy than we use every year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all the time on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been doing it for the first time , the cost of solar power to 50 percent of the gdp is to reduce <unk> rupees , <unk> rupees .
the cost of the solar economy is about 50 percent .
last month has been released with a study that shows that up to the end of this decade in the sunny parts of the united states , solar dollars per <unk> , compared to 15 cents per national average cost .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;re going to get water .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> in 1990 , when it was <unk> on saturn , it was back to the earth ?
he took a famous photo . what was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live in a <unk> life .
we live on a planet with 70 percent of the water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of the saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting about <unk> percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there &apos;s new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation with dean <unk> , one of the innovators of doing it , one of the innovators of doing it , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the one of you may have heard the size of a <unk> in <unk> .
it can make a thousand liters of clean water drinking a day of different sources -- whether it &apos;s saltwater , polluted water -- and all that for less than two cents a gallon .
the <unk> of coca-cola has <unk> <unk> , a large <unk> to a hundred units in the developing world .
and when it &apos;s all good , and i &apos;m very confident , and i &apos;m very confident , and then you &apos;re going to be able to apply a lot of this technology globally .
this is <unk> innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent of mobile phones from mobile in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just consider a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya by kenya a better than president <unk> 25 years ago .
and if you look at your phone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world that information and communications that has ever been able to predict how nobody could ever predict .
and it &apos;s getting better , the things that you &apos;ve spent and i have a thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology is now literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is potentially , what &apos;s going on in the field .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of doing that so-called $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize .
we need teams of all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a computer cell so that you can &apos;t talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test <unk> .
and to win the device a better diagnosis for a better diagnosis than a team .
imagine this device . right in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> sequenced , who is not familiar , <unk> it , and prevents a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are on population .
we &apos;ve just been the <unk> .
and just by the way , the biggest <unk> is an explosion of a better upbringing and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had two billion people connected to each other .
by 2020 , we &apos;re <unk> by two billion <unk> <unk> .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , are the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
and instead of <unk> , i see one of the biggest economic history of history .
these people represent several <unk> dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by a healthier healthier , and they &apos;re going to get better through the <unk> , and by doing so much more productive , 3d printers than ever before .
so , what can three billion growing healthy , healthy , educated , productive members of <unk> us ?
now , what would it be with a sentence , never before <unk> .
so what if it would be , the oppressed , wherever you &apos;re going to be a voice to make sure to make sure and change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people ?
what would it be with <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned from the x prize is that little teams that are born with passion and focus , extraordinary things , extraordinary things that large companies and governments could create extraordinary things in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you may know .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
depending on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in <unk> .
so , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university professors .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that nowadays , the human pattern are better the proteins of the proteins .
and as these individuals came and looked at who &apos;s best in the world , this was not a <unk> , nor was no <unk> , manchester , manchester who wanted to work as assistant , manchester , a woman who was working as assistant at night and night .
ladies and gentlemen , which is an enormous trust in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to challenge the new challenges , and to do that , what &apos;s needed to do .
we expect some remarkable decades .
thank you .
i think we need something to a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical business , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in business when i can indulge me a piece of my own fake <unk> to give up this piece of my own <unk> .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s make a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> and move forward to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon , and it turns to the statistics and to make this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to refer to a statistic i hope is that most of you have heard about it .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to talk about a 300 when a barrel of 300 .
that means that the number will be safe three of 10 .
this is called the ball of <unk> , it &apos;s coming up , it won &apos;t be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball up to the first base , did it not be done in time and the star was safe .
three .
you know what you call a <unk> in <unk> <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know what &apos;s called a <unk> ?
this is one of the remaining four of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams -- the previous williams -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball players who met during a season season over 400 times over 400 times over 400 time .
let &apos;s turn back into my world medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little bit less likely to talk about it .
so let &apos;s take a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to become a <unk> , whose <unk> 400 is <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine you live in a certain neighborhood , and you have a beloved beloved people with <unk> <unk> and her <unk> <unk> of this one to a <unk> whose <unk> <unk> in <unk> with 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
and it &apos;s a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> should be a <unk> .
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one thing in the whole medicine knows that no one surgeon or doctor or doctor should be <unk> .
but what we do is that we all of them , including me , including me , including the world &apos;s being perfect .
never make a mistake , no one but the details thought about the details of how to be supposed .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school medical school .
i was a <unk> student .
in high school , a school student said that brian <unk> could learn a <unk> .
and that &apos;s how it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters of general hospital in toronto , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and the tail every <unk> , every branch of every artery , which is the ascending <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i knew even the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and all the time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was okay , i closed up with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school with the impression that if i knew everything and everything as much as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as possible as possible , that i was immune to this .
and it worked for a while i met my wife printer .
i &apos;m a <unk> here in toronto , in toronto , as a woman printer to me in toronto , the hospital was brought in .
at that time , i was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> service .
and it was my mission , as the <unk> of advice was looking for the <unk> advice .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i shaved woman printers and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , she made <unk> sound .
and when i was able to hear their chest with the <unk> <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on the two sides that she was under <unk> heart failure .
this is a state in the heart of the heart , rather than all of the blood going up to pump in a part of the blood vessel in the lungs and then filling this together , therefore , the <unk> .
and that was not a hard diagnostic diagnosis .
i asked them , and i made me .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> water , water pills , so that they <unk> the fluid .
and over a period of a year and a half and two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on on the top , and i did what was going to be a call in my <unk> , so that he would have an opportunity to make a personal picture .
and he knew she would be able to get rid of additional information .
maybe i did .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so , and so i would have to talk to my patients without him .
my second mistake was worse .
and that &apos;s what i sent her home , <unk> , i &apos;m trying to say a little voice to me , &quot; that &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was so much of <unk> that i asked the nurse , which was a woman asked her woman &apos;s printer , &quot; believe that it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and i said , in <unk> , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an <unk> and <unk> and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i worked on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , getting the hospital and went to the parking room to drive the car home , when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went through my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister &apos;s sister &apos;s sister , but another three of three words are scared to me and these three words , most of the <unk> that i know .
other doctors fear this as well , but the <unk> is particularly because we &apos;re just going to see the patient &apos;s time .
three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that you were at home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
so , &quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she arrived after i sent her home after i sent her home , collapsed and the family called 911 . the <unk> brought back to the mit &apos;s blood pressure with a blood pressure .
they &apos;re barely breathing and blue <unk> .
the <unk> blew all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they march them to the <unk> .
i was shocked by the inner <unk> .
and i was going through these rollercoaster , because they came home after the <unk> , and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days , i realized that she had never been again .
she had no <unk> <unk> .
her family .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they found themselves the <unk> .
the <unk> day they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman and grandmother .
you know , you don &apos;t forget the names of those who never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this .
so the next weeks i made , and i had the first time to be the unhealthy shame that was there in our medical culture -- i felt isolated , isolated , not the kind of intense shame you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you know , you all know the healthy shame , if you &apos;re a secret of your best friend , although that &apos;s one of the <unk> , and then you get caught and the best friend and a <unk> , and the best friend , if you take a bad amount of a mistake .
if you do <unk> , and you never make the mistakes .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the <unk> kind of talk about that , is the one in the heart .
it &apos;s the one that says that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but it &apos;s not bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on my <unk> , he was very gentle .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was <unk> , and sure he was not going to sued .
but i asked these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why am i <unk> home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i went into medicine ?
slowly , but it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke out , and i said , maybe i can feel better .
and i was struck with me that if i went into my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake that could the voice <unk> .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in a <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north toronto north toronto , and i <unk> a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of us in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed up on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out to be a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can tell the google , but it &apos;s not infection in the <unk> , but the top is the <unk> and causes the <unk> .
and luckily he died .
he got <unk> <unk> and <unk> a few days later .
and i went back to the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt and self-doubt , and went to <unk> me and went to the work until again and again , and again , again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve missed two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of them to do , especially if you think you &apos;re in a hospital that was working on a hospital that was only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i sent them home , and i probably sent them home , and there &apos;s no <unk> in their treatment .
i thought he would have <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys of the kidneys , and when it was <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient gave a <unk> in the bottom right and called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked to my colleagues him .
and he was doing that , and when he was a <unk> in the right bottom , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and they went well .
both of them <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
it alone , and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t talk to my own mistakes , and you can talk about them , if i agree the little voice that tells me what &apos;s really happening is how i share with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my own mistakes , so they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i was a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when you heard the last time you heard the last time you heard about somebody heard about <unk> ?
oh yeah , they go to a cocktail party and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to talk somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues and asking their immediate help and start to ask them to tell them what i was telling you about , i would probably achieve the end of the second story before it would really be uncomfortable and the rest of the rest .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues that would be a <unk> in my hospital hospital someone would have bought the wrong leg , then they believe me , i would have trouble .
that &apos;s the system where we live .
it &apos;s an absolute denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do , those who don &apos;t do . those are the ones that are <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s almost a <unk> response to the antibodies , like antibodies , people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones who make mistakes from medicine , that &apos;s a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my way , about 20 years of the medicine and journalism journalism , i have a personal medical trial about medical mistakes and medicine for so much for me to my first article for one of my first article that i wrote to the toronto stern .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day in the daily system is either in which one of the 10 is either a fake or <unk> , or <unk> , in the <unk> , and still more and <unk> .
in this state , for example , in the state , for example .
in the united states , the institute , the institute of medicine for medicine .
both of these are severe <unk> because we don &apos;t think of the problem as we should .
and is the <unk> <unk> .
in fact , in a <unk> in the medical knowledge , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error of cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and <unk> , and i &apos;m going to give a breath breath and suddenly the story <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms .
all these words are inevitable <unk> .
so if you take the system as i take it , as i got it , and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then there &apos;s no more left .
and you know the <unk> talk about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst .
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; i made the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what is with yours ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you with the microphone . &quot;
and then you get your pupils , they &apos;re coming in front of the head , looking down and eat , and they start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i <unk> . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you &apos;re able to do .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physician .
and the newly defined physician is a man , knowing his humanity , she &apos;s accepted , is not proud to do it , but it &apos;s going to be able to learn something from you so that it can be passed on .
they share their experience with others .
they supported them when others talk .
and she shows other people whose mistakes are not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , <unk> way all of it .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes people the system in the system with life , and if that &apos;s so , you know , people are too <unk> .
so that &apos;s how the system evolved to make sense of what makes it easier to make sense of people who are inevitably inevitably , and it also enabled loving to people to create the spaces of the health , even things that could be rewarded . and this particular thing for people like me to do that .
my name is brian <unk> .
i was the newly defined doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best possible to learn from it to other people .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in one minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was <unk> here .
you may think that he <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as much .
it was a <unk> .
until the &apos; 80s , he became great at great style .
now , it stands on the red list as a red list .
this story has a lot of times of the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
still , we still get onto the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the <unk> describe it still as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i &apos;ve seen it as i fell in a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible <unk> , and i persuaded that i really wasn &apos;t from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was <unk> and some of them <unk> .
it was <unk> by about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen were good at it , and they were good in ghana .
when i 27 years later , it was the fish for half its size .
they cut five centimeters .
they were genetically <unk> .
there were still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also was lucky to be there .
so it has nothing changed , and yet it has changed everything .
my third little story is about my favorite little story at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather , at the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe .
<unk> , in fact , the thousands of fish , the <unk> of this very ugly ship , the <unk> of this very ugly ship .
i went to mit , and we took it back across the southern pacific ocean and particularly in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started .
i know it &apos;s the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots in the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
so basically , the bottom came in the sea , and then became <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;ll take a survey through and start with the commercial fishing fishing .
the reason it is changing . it &apos;s in this case -- a hard reason or a soft corals is <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , you throw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them .
in fact , it &apos;s going to be the mountain of <unk> every time of <unk> , if you &apos;re driving in areas where it &apos;s never been .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re going to fit our <unk> to the new level , and we don &apos;t have to remember what was there .
if you <unk> it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , green their country , the <unk> .
over time , it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for the people , they are completely natural .
every generation look at the images that they &apos;re at the beginning of their life life , as standard and everything .
the difference is as a loss .
but you don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give you some changes .
and at the end of it , they just want to get the <unk> remains .
right now that &apos;s the <unk> .
we want to get things that disappeared , or things that are no longer as they were .
now , you could think that the problem of people who are sure is that when you lived in <unk> societies , animals were killing , and they killed people after a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , an animal that was very frequent , which is very frequent , even before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not as big loss .
with the time we focus on the big animals , and the sea is the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be rare because we &apos;re catching them .
there &apos;s a little bit of fish left , and we think this is the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , say it was really different .
they &apos;re going to tell it because the evidence that they &apos;re in the early form shape , are not as much as they would love the evidence .
there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of the report is that the report of a <unk> label that can &apos;t be used in this area , it can &apos;t be used , or not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
it shows the vast big role that can play a <unk> .
because by <unk> , we &apos;re basically the past .
we put the past again that people don &apos;t understand because they have the <unk> changes and very low .
so with that , the people who can see a <unk> , and that &apos;s from the way that it &apos;s possible to reset the <unk> .
what is the people who can &apos;t do that because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
so here , i think the art and the film might be the gap and simulation and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> might remember the avatar .
if you think about the avatar , &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think people were so touched by the people who were so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give up to the cameron of cameron is so he &apos;s called &quot; avatar . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the <unk> <unk> , when you had a typewriter , it had to be when you had a typewriter in the government .
they also had to be a leaf with a <unk> from this <unk> .
the reason for this was able to figure out : the government could come from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they were able to track the father of the thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how someone could do something like this , and how much would be the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you print a new year in 2011 , you can buy a new <unk> of the leading <unk> and a page , and then it has this page bright yellow <unk> on every side of the <unk> and your printer , which is clear to her printers and your printer .
this is happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem <unk> .
and this was an example of which our own governments technology against us , against us , citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing existing <unk> of the world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can control the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> out of ukraine in ukraine .
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which you have money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people are made online to wealth , but they &apos;ve made it illegal for them to have <unk> <unk> to the claws of our <unk> , while we &apos;ve collected our <unk> in the input over the keyboard , while we &apos;ve collected over a giant computer online .
the u.s. intelligence was <unk> two months two months ago , the swiss bank account by mr. jain jain , and it was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on his foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i claim that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be the victim of a <unk> , as a kind of <unk> in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just even worse .
in the future , most of the crime will play online .
the second biggest <unk> we can see today are not getting through cash .
they &apos;re <unk> by something else -- <unk> , or through her audience .
groups of the last 12 months , over the last 12 months , they become a <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are criminals in the money for doing the money for doing it , but the last group of <unk> countries , governments , the attacks , the attacks .
there are the cases of <unk> .
it shows what happens when governments are attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or , or was it .
last fall , it had to sign the <unk> , because he was hacked .
somebody had been hacked , had a system .
and last week , in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior writers of this group , whether it was possible for possible people died because of people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a row of this ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate , if you have a website with <unk> , with a <unk> service , for example .
now , we all use , or a lot of us , or a lot of us , or one of their competitors , but these services are very common in <unk> states like iran , where muslims foreign differences , you know that the local government can &apos;t be able to do their <unk> .
but can it be , if you &apos;re in a foreign basis .
<unk> <unk> + fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s in the case of <unk> .
how does it happen to the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt for instance ?
well , in egypt , the convention in egypt , in egypt , the headquarters in april , the headquarters of egyptian egyptian , and they found a lot of records .
in these files , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , there were some notes in germany , who had been sold by the egyptian government a few programs that they were sold -- in very large framework -- all of the <unk> of the egyptian citizens could capture .
they had this program for <unk> dollars in the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments are <unk> governments with <unk> , so they can make it against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for instance , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , what was called the <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , it &apos;s going to <unk> your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use their tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> that allowed them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer is the obvious answer of the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a citizen citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we live today , 2011 , our governments , like our governments trust , is every right thing we &apos;ve done .
and trust us , we don &apos;t trust the trust of any future , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to do the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made of <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> <unk> with a simple idea : <unk> made the fit .
<unk> became very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us in the ways to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , a brick .
basically the <unk> has become the block block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego , lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones are produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they need to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego made it for all possible .
lego has basically the <unk> , the building block of the world , took a building block for our imagination .
in the same year at the bell labs , the next year we announced the next revolution .
the transistor was a little <unk> that separates us from a world of static , <unk> building building a world in everything everything was interactive .
like the <unk> , allows us to build much more complex , more complex loops , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts to experts and therefore decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea how to make the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
so they can &apos;t sit around them .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a <unk> , blue is power , pink is input and orange .
so all you need to do is a blue and a green one , and you can link them to each other .
you add a blue on a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between it , and you &apos;ve got a little <unk> .
take the switch out there &apos;s a <unk> , which is , and you have a little <unk> .
and then they put this <unk> for an extra effect , and they made a <unk> .
i will stop that .
the simple thing is , actually , is actually quite powerful .
so instead of being coding , you have to program or <unk> <unk> , allowing you to <unk> them with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate this , or to slow down or slow , you just turn on this button , and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind is that there is a growing library .
we want to have every single interaction on this world in a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- all should be available .
we have <unk> children , and they see them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how they start the electronics that they understand in the everyday , and they &apos;re not going to learn to school .
like , for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or like an ipod respond to touch .
we also have <unk> <unk> .
so we had no experience for designers with no experience in electronic things that began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we have <unk> , and gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what do you . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , fear in the darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> <unk> another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material for everyone .
so open source source .
you can go on the website , all the <unk> and they make them .
we want to the world of the creator , the inventor , the <unk> , because the world that we live , these interactive world , we heard these interactive world .
so , pulling them up and catching them .
thank you .
