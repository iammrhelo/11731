there &apos;s some things you need to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage here was <unk> muhammad , <unk> muhammad , <unk> leaders in africa .
by raising it from their <unk> .
traditionally , the africans hate governments -- they &apos;re like <unk> .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get the help from the government , and he makes a second , <unk> boat .
something that connects us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge of the <unk> filter , these personalized filters , is that they get this balance of balance , because they &apos;re all going to go through the end .
it &apos;s supposed to take us to new ideas and to new people and strangers .
and the man replied , &quot; pretty beautiful <unk> , what ? &quot;
i know that they &apos;re going to wait for another bad wait for -- i &apos;m just fun -- but now it &apos;s just a short iteration , and then i &apos;ll show you new materials , and i &apos;m going to show you new materials .
in may , in may , there &apos;s an update on version 2.0 , which is an update on 2.0 of <unk> <unk> .
once all republican here : it shouldn &apos;t be about <unk> .
what struck me to the people on the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and there &apos;s actually no no one , except a few people trying to use the beach to use the beach .
we have <unk> that bacteria eat oil ?
this is <unk> all the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor <unk> , they peaked at least .
so what &apos;s going to do with the birds of the birds , i don &apos;t want to make a <unk> <unk> of people who clean birds .
okay , people who are taking care of themselves as conservative , if you really want to be really , really conservative , right , then they should send this <unk> to the <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i have developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
all right : i &apos;m more than my genes , &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to <unk> it because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a result .
and it &apos;s just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human <unk> .
now , cells , like trees , can grow up new branches and old ones .
and we can even talk about <unk> .
if you get that number , you can easily get that there &apos;s a big potential for <unk> in the brain .
potentially , this technique will be able to be able to take us through and pull ourselves through our own brain .
he works mostly in music videos and ads with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we prepared a quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a couple months ago , a friend sent me a friend to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did this .
so his farm is incredibly .
and then he found this <unk> plant , the <unk> .
and then she flies in a circle .
i finally got to try and try to try and try .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no <unk> .
what to hell is that ?
at least . i think i think it &apos;s .
farmers who rely on nature to find answers to the answers , instead of nature solutions .
and from the old to new fire , means to move two great stories about oil and electricity that will give both two <unk> of the fossil <unk> into the air .
our fuel for mobility is about three fifth cars .
you can make it , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
and trucks and airplanes can use realistic hydrogen or more advanced biofuels .
even better light and <unk> and so forth that <unk> <unk> around a third rate .
for example , in about 20 <unk> , private costs of solar cells without financial losses on their roofs and lower their <unk> .
and what we used to do it is , it &apos;s going to be like the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we buy more of it , what we have , or new nuclear , or less .
so to try to focus on the results , and not motivations , to concentrate , <unk> , conflict , conflict towards the <unk> solution of america .
later , i realized that what i ate , two <unk> of his family .
these simple <unk> shows that donor companies , where the least kids go to school , they don &apos;t have schools fund , and it takes new questions on .
two years ago , on december 8 , i phoned my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember , and we can see this in every book of my <unk> son , that live four billion years ago -- four billion points two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks ; there are <unk> . a trap .
you &apos;ve got time thinking of time to talk about art and things like this .
you go back , back to the future , back , back .
they all come from families that are often one person at home , usually the mother or grandmother , and they come up for their education and their structure .
we put them on to the right and left to the left , so that you can tell them , and the consequences you know when they reject orders .
let &apos;s all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s <unk> .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for <unk> .
then you can support . this is the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen to them .
let &apos;s take the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , you think about the content of wikipedia , and you &apos;ve created the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there &apos;s a lot of people that have the same dream .
a website is created .
there was no leader .
extremism is too tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens is an incredibly complex process .
we can make sounds apart from our own language apart , but not the alien languages .
we announced that by the study of the american babies who never heard a second language , at the beginning of the discovery .
it may look like a <unk> from mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to its environment , while art is usually an emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a <unk> over here to show you this .
let me show you this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the <unk> were burned from a little girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of the human <unk> .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote with compassion ?
the wound of all the maggots .
suppose you may like , and honestly , who don &apos;t like you ?
we start with a <unk> , and we &apos;ll give another <unk> .
then there was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s pretty dead .
&quot; i have what <unk> ! &quot; i don &apos;t have a <unk> . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby and saw these indian guys .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; oh , magic is the only profession .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how to terrorism with our everyday life .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that whose life is not about ideology and politics , but of the economic pressures .
i think a lot of people holding me a little bit of <unk> .
but most of all , she was serious <unk> with crime .
this money became <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- in cash .
no one wants to do that the <unk> has controls his <unk> and his <unk> with consumers .
some of you may think now , &quot; wait a minute . it doesn &apos;t necessarily look like a <unk> .
clearly , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t see was that it &apos;s very , very uncomfortable by definition , his <unk> .
and since i &apos;ve really learned that , the greater challenge , the greater the feeling , the bigger feeling of a while , when you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really very big .
but it wasn &apos;t without <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green pulley on the horizon , which is very nervous about the rising rise .
we can start to make better , more competent decisions .
<unk> <unk> : why i <unk> across the pacific
this is the world trade <unk> on the front page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do this ?
it doesn &apos;t see the <unk> cost . it doesn &apos;t take any extra time .
they were able to make it .
and ultimately , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s because they didn &apos;t feel well in places that they didn &apos;t feel well .
and that &apos;s hard , if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not that hard , somebody <unk> , and one day of school i said , &quot; you can <unk> my homework <unk> , and i gave him the wrong answer that i wrote before .
so we both went back to the back benches in the class , so we were not going to be <unk> .
maybe you have your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never tell them , because how can you tell yourself , because how can you tell you ?
this is french science .
all right , then .
if you look at these trucks here , it &apos;s the largest truck of its kind on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing material of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada &apos;s going on the number three is in terms of <unk> per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is to do .
by doing this , we remove a large part of our biggest <unk> and replacing them with the most greenhouse gasses , and replacing them with the most greenhouse gas of the future .
the <unk> of their work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead , and it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s close to the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw was born in <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , and in london .
i hope to convince you that complex and complicated are not always the same .
the <unk> <unk> is the one we want to do -- the public support for the government .
so i suggested to my first tedtalk that we would spend as a planet for 21 billion hours a week to play video games .
just 30 minutes per day , a day ago , a significant improvement in mood and <unk> increase in the joy of joy .
why a game ?
so how could i play a <unk> game such as a huge effect in such a huge effect , sometimes <unk> situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience that involved in <unk> growth , and there are scientifically <unk> things that you can do every day to build this resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
through more of practice , they &apos;re <unk> .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you give somebody your hand six seconds , it &apos;s going to be a lot of blood flow in your blood flow .
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and we &apos;re doing that with us . actually , thousands of people involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
and then some people came out of chicago and said , &quot; at the end of 2007 , the slogan of the chicago <unk> festival is the global warming . we have a 3,000-square-foot <unk> and we want them to fill them with her reef . &quot;
and they &apos;re not just two concepts that are going to fit right .
<unk> asked : &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . it &apos;s <unk> . right .
so , what we have so , from <unk> , because of the domestic <unk> , the proof that the most famous math is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their work with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> property -- the self-confidence -- is my view of the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and someday we &apos;ll hopefully understand what &apos;s happening .
this person is otherwise <unk> and intelligent minds , but when he sees his mom , he grabs his delusion and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if that &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces faces .
tables and chairs and <unk> -- nothing happens to normal people , but if i show him a picture of his mom , the <unk> activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a compelling , <unk> experience .
maybe you can do that by the <unk> , the spasm of the phantom .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days , i didn &apos;t have a phantom and therefore no more <unk> in the elbow , no spasm <unk> in <unk> . all my pain are gone .
<unk> is blue , <unk> is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
their <unk> is to <unk> , which most of us don &apos;t .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video is <unk> .
well .
he learned that he could take both of these things with his <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , much more and <unk> for <unk> .
a framework is a hut .
does it look where the sound is ?
because we think it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some of the stars die in spectacular supernova explosions that are like that remains .
on the right , there &apos;s the gravity . einstein has explained that .
and it brings out new ways of change .
it was still too early , but he was a moral <unk> , a inspiration for scientist who were concerned about the control of the gun .
let &apos;s take place , aliens , we would have seen our <unk> point from far outside of the cosmos and not only for 40 years , but the total of the last year billion years of history .
martin <unk> : is this our last century ?
and it gets worse , &quot; i would make a picture of it and a dozen <unk> .
well , these are undergraduates , so they took a lot of the money for things like <unk> and make-up .
and then we asked them again , how happy they are .
but enormously different motivations .
these are <unk> in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend on it were to other people spend on other teams and ended up in the end in the end .
now , when we hear today from the <unk> , from the high <unk> , often make us believe that this is one of these <unk> conflict of the middle east , that roots as the region itself is .
ironically , it was at a time when the <unk> of iran was brilliant , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that focuses on the diplomacy , diplomacy function , is the diplomacy of war inevitable .
you can search with certain things , or you can look at the different regions and you compare them to different regions .
the map of port <unk> at the end of 2009 was not as good as it could be , not as well as the map of california .
so the trick is .
he said , &quot; he was not a <unk> . &quot;
this system wants the status quo quo , but the status quo is the status quo .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is the most important . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , we need to the citizens , to the republic .
for example , some people are going to sputnik in this room thanks to sputnik .
this is on my pen . &quot;
every one is <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law is not true , it &apos;s true .
here &apos;s the model of the <unk> .
if you see in north america , they &apos;re like so many things are independent in the united states . they ignore each other .
every one of its <unk> depends on the critical area , the <unk> that shows you about the 10,000 independent cells , each of which each of each of each other has a <unk> , has a high tension , a low tension , a low -- to pump a signal .
they were a little in <unk> , but then apart .
so i &apos;d like to show you a couple of interviews with people who were pointing to the opening up on the bridge , and describe what happened .
now you don &apos;t think of yourself as a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to <unk> and go back .
it &apos;s just a few tons here , so they &apos;re pretty quick .
but the <unk> scientist in his field .
i didn &apos;t know what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told them , they were supposed to look for name , their <unk> , or the <unk> of her mother .
and also , maybe this <unk> or maybe a <unk> that can be economically not worth worth of resilience or pests or pests or another property that is useful for climate change .
we &apos;re going to see children in television .
the idea was that it &apos;s cold cold , so you have natural temperatures under the <unk> .
and when something happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
pay attention to your body . this is not right .
maybe any woman &apos;s lady , a woman ? -- thank you .
you just have two concepts -- two concepts -- two in the u.s. , and one at the russians .
insane ! i &apos;ve got to talk about innovation -- the things that will evolve , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they will die through something else .
i can &apos;t tell you when it comes out , because i don &apos;t want the competition to my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that will happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk about a little bit about the commercial development of the <unk> space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has an epiphany .
and institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , has the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is <unk> .
the toothpaste is from <unk> .
they know that bees and fish in their own lives .
all around us will be a medical revolution , a revolution that will help us , some of the worst diseases of our society to defeat cancer .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood supply is after the treatment .
but the real question is , how do this work work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> , it doesn &apos;t stop angiogenesis .
but more interestingly , from the study of the men , the <unk> , so the men who have evolved more tomato , in the bottom , fewer blood vessels that feed your cancer .
albert von <unk> once said that , &quot; discovery is what you &apos;ve seen before , and think of what &apos;s nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> in discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike a common problems that are honest , are not particularly good mysteries .
that &apos;s the background .
you can &apos;t do it physically physically , but on a computer , it &apos;s going to be a computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
in which they &apos;re probably going to fall out here ?
so there are games like &quot; the brain , &quot; the <unk> dave , a <unk> .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really think that a girl is so powerful , so powerful that we all had to train .
i remember , as an example , my father who was very , very violent .
we are used to be girls of the <unk> girl , <unk> of their own life , that we actually actually made objects and put them into them .
and she looked at the eyes of her babies and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby .
when we were there , she was a ritual where you &apos;re girls , the <unk> , with their families .
and i will be going to be on the rest of your life on your side . &quot;
i love it , i love things .
why should they want me to <unk> me ?
so , in the actual process , all the six teenagers came out of and <unk> the <unk> that they had done by the scene .
but this incident took place , in january , in the northern hemisphere , at 7 a.m.
this is 10 meters away .
and what shows this example -- what &apos;s important to us in mind ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and traveling a year through africa where i asked people why they built fractals , what &apos;s a great job if you can get it .
and it turns out in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use long , because it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s very cheap .
now , awkward quickly .
we have a <unk> <unk> .
the bad news is .
instead of getting friends , or relatives , they looked at it .
today , <unk> development will be applied in a hundred countries in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to the <unk> .
the fear of <unk> are losing .
we put some rules on and we keep on them .
the conversation will be better . &quot;
now , when i <unk> tonight , to come here , i started one of my daughters <unk> .
and we developed 10 .
i was a teenager , when i was for the first time , &quot; anna <unk> , &quot; and the famous first phrase , &quot; everyone happy families identical .
i want to show you how to be so beautiful .
if i was here in the water in the water , you can see a <unk> <unk> , and this is the <unk> that the water &apos;s <unk> , which is <unk> . it &apos;s dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla success was not going to succeed .
one thing that i want to make is clear that not all the <unk> are wearing <unk> .
we can <unk> them or turn them on or .
it &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it into the circuits of the mood in cases of depression .
we &apos;re looking at understanding what these circuits are , and what are the brain areas for the clinical trials and symptoms are symptoms of those diseases .
evolution works in reality , like an <unk> as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough .
what we &apos;ve discovered is , if you look at the top of a person , like richard , or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , the relative <unk> of this feather is the same for all that we &apos;ve seen before .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s amazing , students have tried , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he does it with a <unk> glue .
what we &apos;re doing is we take the hairs as a model , and imagine it together with another colleague of mine .
i showed that by the <unk> <unk> , two thirds of the men &apos;s men have children , but only one third of the women are women but only one-third of women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and went to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; what &apos;s like it ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school school about a woman called heidi <unk> .
and i took my hand back again , and i noticed that in all of the other women , and then you have to have more questions , just by men . &quot;
and a woman who got me on this and i looked at her -- she saw a little baby .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as well as they should , but they do it .
so not fear was the <unk> factor .
but it turns out into black .
i &apos;m going to talk about how we &apos;re talking about how to think about how we get into this country , how we get to information .
so you &apos;re in <unk> , <unk> language , and it works .
we tell them all that everything is okay . it &apos;s good .
this patient is about 50 , so we can pretty precisely tell how big is the risk of becoming prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the <unk> of the audience in this room .
and this bee had thought , &quot; i &apos;m <unk> myself now , &quot; i &apos;m <unk> myself now , that flower , i &apos;m getting the nectar and i &apos;m going to get off . &quot;
and when you talk about nature , as a writer , my favorite subject is how the idea is the <unk> ?

the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : quite <unk> , on a <unk> , even i could get a <unk> of 10 <unk> in 15 minutes .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass of this altitude , on these <unk> , and it &apos;s got something interesting .
and now i &apos;m saying that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , the real thing . there &apos;s nothing to do .
come back to a certain time , get your drinks for half .
and then they can really reach in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a <unk> dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked about the last time a couple years ago .
you can also see this if i turn this around here -- hopefully i don &apos;t <unk> the world .
you can see , here &apos;s it .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> <unk> , who would have <unk> students , discovered the law of the <unk> <unk> , just as a kind of a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it fun to work fun .
and that &apos;s why we work , and we actually have people who are excited about this and crazy enough that they work on , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel was like he said to him for his passengers was the experience of the experience .
what makes life easier , more enjoyable ?
in the part , you know this , by taking a great new facility , the basement one of their hospitals used to build the basement one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems have been <unk> , and we &apos;re in fact part of the present problem .
and as brunel , we can , by the systems of systems , have a greater impact .
by my responsibility , <unk> the waiter with his boss .
mark <unk> and i have tried to answer a series of studies to answer this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm needs .
but the <unk> was the <unk> availability of all these <unk> on the market .
the americans themselves discover that <unk> choice in the theory of theory seem to seem more attractive than in practice .
<unk> parents would be more likely to say things like , &quot; noah was just for such a short time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once once once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one together : they &apos;re <unk> problems that are controlled by nature .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s needed by cooperation .
and then we &apos;re building a <unk> that we can test the air on machines on machines , and we can test very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the <unk> best can &apos;t be as a <unk> , but as a <unk> movement .
the <unk> enter the stage .
and then the <unk> nuclear power that would provide the energy for the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and put it on the screen of your screen , and it &apos;s exploding from the outside that , right .
if you replace the word of the word , or you replace the internet , it &apos;s very , very , very <unk> . let &apos;s hear it in .
i think it was the exchange that has led to computer .
ph : i hope you understand how <unk> this is .
finally , the race to the future of the future , as the phone phone <unk> .
mm : because there &apos;s a role in the audience to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has <unk> , which is built a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is an spanish architect and designer .
color can <unk> simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it has given me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about and build a few installations .
the operation that the city for the public space has been carrying is significant , almost an international model .
even the bits of the aircraft had names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that &apos;s what i was like , after some of <unk> , and <unk> , in the design of the chair i ended up with you .
he said , she &apos;s got a new , good chairs .
or they pull them up high in the position .
and i knew the experience of experience , and if i <unk> myself in the office , where there were <unk> to <unk> , that would never come to the idea of the idea , <unk> , to make it in position .
and dengue has spread in <unk> .
two days or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember any more exactly , i &apos;ve read that <unk> <unk> <unk> , about 52 million cases , about 52 million cases , with about 400 cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so that it &apos;s not the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males is females , a lot of offspring .
so <unk> aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time , i don &apos;t remove me , although i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the data available data .
well , our mobile phone can now have a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : their health depends on where they live .
this is my grandfather .
from the simple reason , nobody else else is talking about it .
like the beginning , the plants are pulling phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a <unk> of &quot; nature &quot; to the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of them are mentioned as they lost .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take a dose of 25 percent .
so we have a functioning technology and one which is at <unk> use some of the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re doing on the world in the world .
and he was a <unk> , <unk> : he considered all of the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than the norms .
and in this example , you can see that the number of things are repeat , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
as an architect , i think about relationships between the computer and the whole , but in terms of design , it will always be a matter for business .
we put ourselves on the level of the building in the building , where we could build these five separate towers , but they should all be at the fourth floor .
let &apos;s come back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;re going to see that this landscape is actually used to be <unk> as a rainforest .
the difference is particularly in <unk> in <unk> desert , or maybe <unk> in whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste waste , a lot of things that are illegal , and now at the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizer , which is huge problems in the water quality , in rivers , lakes , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for <unk> .
but we can do that , and there &apos;s some opportunities .
north is the biggest <unk> on the <unk> .
to work together .
so , what &apos;s the kind of thing that is produced ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system is not getting taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biology to amplify these <unk> -- muscles .
this is what it looks like .
so here we are , or cut the nerve off , from the little parts of the <unk> parts of the <unk> and the other whales that gave us the <unk> -- signal . two other , which gives us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t have an electrode there and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- a little bit more <unk> to wear .
this is jesse and he presses a <unk> .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa has been infected by these conditions , there 22 million people living with hiv , which are <unk> 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments in front of the place is to be effective in clinical trials in clinical trials that are authorized in the different world in clinical trials that are authorized by the government and the <unk> of the study .
the fundamental problems that we face with is a high consumption of consumption and too many people .
so they meet all the criteria that people usually normally enjoy .
so you see this electricity that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> in this case -- the way to the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> , the galapagos , the galapagos .
we also know that , not just <unk> , but the same magellanic and other <unk> .
so i want to show you the penguins in <unk> .
turbo &apos;s got to pat his <unk> on the door to pat the door on the door . we put it in here .
and then there &apos;s another thing that &apos;s quite pleasant is coming .
well , here &apos;s a fundamental problem we didn &apos;t have solved : our basic political geography .
they &apos;re a pretty long frontier .
again , like in the case of mongolia , china has gone to russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
for <unk> countries , china <unk> its <unk> , so that <unk> , and they &apos;re cheaper to be <unk> and <unk> to china .
so what i want to you here is , i call <unk> , day after day .
these two arrows make an arch , an arch of <unk> and other infrastructure that <unk> the west bank with gaza <unk> .
most of them .
so what comes next ? what is the future of the european union ?
53 countries and most of the players are straight lines on the map .
this dream is <unk> .
is it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone encodes growth .
so how can the hormone end of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are active , which are <unk> in particular circumstances -- if food is there , if there &apos;s food , not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on the lifespan of people .
in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of what i &apos;ve been talking about , which is a very quickly one , another <unk> , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see an ad like this , because nike wants to buy their shoes .
they all have heroes , the <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to run into a <unk> .
and this view is a lot of what a lot of <unk> <unk> like prozac is essentially the chemistry of the brain , as if it was the brain of a chemical soup , as if the brain was chemical soup .
and my co-author , seymour seymour believes this .
what we found through what we found was that a mutant , much longer needed to turn back to the <unk> , and when we <unk> the genes that there was a role in that mutation in this mutation could discover .
this question has been asked for a long time for a long time , but we actually test it .
or so , mosquitoes find us in the dark , by <unk> . they &apos;re smell .
so you can see it , this is the cheese .
people actually told me that they &apos;re being bitten by mosquitos now .
in <unk> .
and every time i feel the <unk> looks like the eyes of the eyes of his eyes .
and like <unk> , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
while we &apos;re talking about <unk> clinical trials at the study of the use of stem cells for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have these angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela .
so what happens if that &apos;s what doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything else , because i left the news .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but what ?
it &apos;s actually better . it seems that we can make these receivers , using the help of the material that is encoded in the dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s going to be made his wings , it &apos;s <unk> that , but it doesn &apos;t really pick it up , because the fly is between two <unk> trapped .
for a smart creatures like our fly , it &apos;s not going to be in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal through experience .
so through a lot of experiments we were able to take the identity of the critic &apos;s identity to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , as you could do that , but we have not just solved one example of how intelligent behavior of the physical interactions is living in living .
so , here &apos;s libby , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : all right . tb : all right . a little bit like , please , a little more .
from their own experience , i know that hospitals could be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my <unk> from legacy .
one thing i &apos;m saying is , this kind of <unk> , which is everything that includes everything , from their goals to their genes , is the <unk> transformation that we see in health care .
they stick it like a <unk> or glue .
so here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you get to the bottom of the <unk> and it &apos;s got a <unk> or we would shake the leaf ? &quot;
and so <unk> did well . and he does this .
of course , completely different than you see it in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say the people who are working on the oceans and thinking about the goals , we need much lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice is melting down the sea level by six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the corals are islands .
their relation to the temperature .
but then at the end , you see the <unk> <unk> in black .
we have very interesting technology that we &apos;ve done in the atmosphere of the atmosphere , millions of years , we &apos;ve always done it with <unk> , but in this case , we go 20 million years .
and this is the problem that he asked , how gravity works : how gravity works .
einstein had been in space and time , warps and flexible and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of the room , the idea , could be more dimensions than we see there .
and the same way the strings of a <unk> look like , you can vibrate in the different patterns in different patterns .
not .
is this just an interesting mathematical process that might be able to explain some of some <unk> properties of the world , or we can actually prove these extra dimensions actually ?
so we have two plates with colored points .
now , can you see the predator &apos;s <unk> , which is how to attack it ?
and what &apos;s sensory information is true for all of information .
and we look at 30 seconds of what a lot is a hammer in a 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because if the redwood redwood was in this shadow , and the same amount of light on your eye would turn the same amount of light on their eye , they would have to reflect more . just according to laws physics .
where do you know ?
and she comes in the beehive , finds a <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- and that &apos;s honey .
he gets it . it &apos;s madness or ?
do you agree ? yes ?
often , there &apos;s no right there or wrong .
in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a human storyteller .
now some things : understanding , the risks , the risks , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the most risks that we face .
think of cancer , bird flu , sars , sars .
there was no new findings , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> , which we call it <unk> , and data <unk> <unk> and data to the <unk> .
i was familiar with a different group of knowing whether my plane was safe to fly .
this <unk> people .
and he was at stanford , at stanford .
they had good suggestions with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took anyone to do anything , or to save them , or to save me as a volunteer , but i found out that nobody did something .
we opened the first stage in 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups were very often called &quot; terrorists . &quot;
you need a <unk> process , which is very complicated to the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that , we probably think of the first time in the history of the arab world &apos;s revolution : a <unk> .
so the paradox is that the <unk> decade was so <unk> .
once we call the <unk> , the ngos are not only on the streets -- but they took them in the negotiations , because they took the victims in the negotiations , because they <unk> the victims of those weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , this strange , rich man in the film ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the sun &apos;s coming straight to the boat , it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to admit i &apos;m a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of radical things about how we think about cancer , to a audience that &apos;s a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of the ingredients .
it &apos;s going to find a huge amount of information in genetics , by just the genetic repertoire .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; okay . at least one guy &apos;s good connected . &quot;
so we measure each more than a very own .
if you have malaria , we &apos;re giving them <unk> , or some <unk> .
where we really need to get to the process , the process , and that &apos;s at the level of <unk> activities on the level of the body , the body doesn &apos;t heal how it does it normally ?
danny hillis : cancer .
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people .
because at stage three , most of us are most of us .
this is their <unk> .
there was no plan . never before anyone .
in fact , martin luther king was <unk> sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair .
and then suddenly they took the <unk> out and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of africa ? &quot;
automatically <unk> : we <unk> the little bit of plastic .
these <unk> , or <unk> <unk> that were designed to go to the floor for the soil on the floor that they face , they were not as permanent buildings .
she <unk> the stability and the security of an uncle can deliver a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but by my perspective , compassion is a problem .
and it &apos;s the <unk> shape of happiness .
i can &apos;t really tell them , and he &apos;s not .
stories like these , sign like these , are practical aid in a world that will seek out to bring compassion to the <unk> of suffering that would otherwise otherwise us .
gandhi was a really <unk> man .
and the first day , our <unk> came to us , and we taught us our slogan that we had to make every day for the rest of the summer , to make the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of them famous .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group , without knowing , instinctively , the other .
so that &apos;s the world where we live today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather in my own way .
okay , number two : they go in the wild .
and imagine that , you &apos;re looking at an inner image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening , we face incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
now we have 30 different technologists for 18 different technologists , and we were able to connect millions of people to connect millions of people in order to learn to what this needs of the needs and demands .
and my father came to me my father and said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation that make it better than the previous previous .
i know a lot of people who are very smart , and yet , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i was born with another family .
don &apos;t believe that we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still go to the same four years old years old .
but this is not a good life .
that &apos;s what he <unk> .
whether you don &apos;t believe it doesn &apos;t matter .
so he said , &quot; what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s in yours in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and that basketball represents her identity , what they are .
when my kids were still tiny , i went into her room , put me on her room , sat down on her bed and watched my children .
it &apos;s less than i <unk> -- i <unk> three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have a hundred laptops , each containing a different collection of 100 books , so that the <unk> had 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
you answer the question : how does it feel to discover that ?
we &apos;re actually learning that really bad lesson .
think for a moment , as it is to feel .
and unlike all other animals , we are obsessed with them , trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i write this incredibly <unk> book about a subject that all hate , for an audience that would never give .
the effect of this is not just <unk> wheat wheat , but mountains of grains .
1986 came from vietnam to america .
the answer was <unk> : &quot; that &apos;s worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank on a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom dotcom system has tripled our <unk> .
and bhutan &apos;s bhutan , for the most recent democracy of the world , two years old .
so it &apos;s actually so that we &apos;re getting a lot in the west for happiness , rather than if happiness is something that we need to be , or maybe several things we need to do .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as a society is that we can impact the <unk> of production , by creating the right conditions , so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : all bl . one , two , three .
under the deck , you know , the <unk> , you move the <unk> , but the eyes are moving up with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , do you come up with the top ?
the method : what did you see ? what &apos;s what you observe ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice , and they &apos;re willing to express them , and so they &apos;re supposed to express the last word in this short story .
poor people have no choice of choice .
we were <unk> in the 70s &apos; 70s .
and around there , we have to recognize that the principle of a <unk> isn &apos;t just the way we &apos;ve talked about , but also our society <unk> .
now 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody who has already said , &quot; yeah , great stuff up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at <unk> davis system and got a lot of attention to it . that allowed me to finance the start of the program of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people wonder if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like this , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , which is not a <unk> direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> of toxins in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , called &quot; <unk> death . &quot;
and then months later , i learned who he was really .
i search for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it in life when you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we &apos;ve been able to redefine the hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows that he defeated .
so to give you this , we need to put them back to the driver .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people into it , we <unk> the building from the inside , the <unk> , and we helped for the first <unk> , and save the rescue .
if i do that , i don &apos;t get the original details . the contrary , i could write this story .
you &apos;re withheld from the public opinion .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and that &apos;s about democracy .
here &apos;s the question : the country &apos;s average is better , china or india ?
because the indian man has an advantage life expectancy for two years to the indian woman .
what political change is , they have <unk> .
china , so i think it &apos;s still some of the great , <unk> of the foundations -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that are not there in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> backgrounds and with various <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now you have the problem that you &apos;ve spent all of the money to do that with these advanced electronics in these countries , and now it &apos;s all <unk> .
a little chaotic environment , where many of the ideas came together , where people are more likely to have a new , interesting , <unk> , people of different backgrounds .
about one or two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> called howard <unk> , and i wrote a <unk> notebook from this period .
she <unk> themselves in their colleagues , but everyone said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was .
does it go to the other direction ?
in the 1970s , the &quot; one percent &quot; 10 percent of the national income are in the united states in the united states .
many of these political factors are going to be roughly summarized in the category of &quot; capitalism , &quot; political <unk> , who are a group of good interconnected , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
while you &apos;re fairly easy to see how globalization and technology revolution is the global rule of money , it &apos;s much more difficult to grade .
so they invest unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern <unk> .
this is his little hand .
we &apos;re all going to die .
this was a huge frustration for us , because we had believed in a new development .
i believe in places like oregon , where you can take care of <unk> , and a toxic dose of <unk> can only have done it .
so long , a long talk short , they came to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as most of the <unk> disease of our time , how did the good and the bad thing together ?
some of the article went to say that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond it , not just to cancer , but it &apos;s about cancer , but it turns out to skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s what these tumors contain tumors in skeletal muscle tumors , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what <unk> is that skeletal muscle may be able to control angiogenesis , which is able to control these blood vessels for themselves .
it &apos;s a very powerful idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
after leaving me my translator .
she was the girl that &apos;s in the breaks for her team .
and i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , which was 11 years old .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot;
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all over korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time talking about the dictionary .
so i open up the window , look out , and see , the <unk> from the side of the hotels to shoot at the altitude . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bath , and they did , and they thought they took our faces and the children .
until the adoption , one year ! a year ! what needs that long time ?
this is their <unk> .
this is sydney that in a few days , three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there &apos;s a little planet , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do more .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal universal , or is it something that affects the rest of the planet ?
and this is deeper <unk> , which is why the science is that the science is , life , how we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , ok , from here .
thank you very much .
you see , while uganda and zimbabwe <unk> , russia was on one percent .
you find the highest hiv of hiv in african countries in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , down the same rate as the united states .
look at kenya here .
it could be something else , which is the transmission of transmission .
we know about <unk> billion people ever lived .
this was not just an economic story .
and the result is even more divergence in a shorter time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same thing with institutions .
they need to eat me . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions of the future , in front of 2016 , if the united states will lose its place as a result of china .
no , we &apos;re going to be <unk> , despite the giant <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve collected around , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work and other parts of our historical <unk> .
niall , thank you .
there are many types of spider spider spider .
spider silk is almost entirely of protein .
the fibers that make a single spider is quite diverse .
also , <unk> has a high potential for its ability to <unk> .
what i &apos;m paying attention is not the <unk> , so lovely , it may be , but the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there &apos;s more photos . there are more photographers .
it sounds <unk> in our ears , but what &apos;s going on is that 80 percent of the <unk> have contributed a lot .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal is to the institution of the institution of the institution is immediately by the end of it .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to figure out whether they &apos;re journalists or not .
she was created by using their <unk> , who use the use of many of these tools , including the <unk> intelligence agencies the world today for the last week for the attacks of the last week .
you know , you know , what &apos;s the <unk> part of the bread is , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just a little bit of fibers , because <unk> is made of fibers .
everything is in his place . first .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the various steps again , under the <unk> of the potential connections of the potential to a deeper level -- my search is about the answer , &quot; what &apos;s so special about bread ? &quot;
that &apos;s transformation , two different things .
and when they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove that they &apos;re alive and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of time from every beer .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of <unk> while we work through this talk .
it takes very much , very long , to write these things , and i &apos;m working on a piece that is <unk> for <unk> pages , and this is a big part of my life and i <unk> my hair .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> by brian <unk> , who &apos;s an extraordinary artist .
so that gives you a little clip of the piece .
so what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave birth to two dishes with lunch : a bowl of <unk> broccoli and a bowl of <unk> .
i mean , ultimately , if we look at the babies at the time , they appear quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer than the babies depend on each other species .
the <unk> is going to make them change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is extremely bright and <unk> , and everything else is like dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and the human species and the human species , &quot; he says the <unk> <unk> <unk> . her research explores how babies capture as babies as babies play .
if i could take you for a little demonstration for a small demonstration , to borrow the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
and then you repeatedly repeatedly this process , and over again , until something -- in this case , it &apos;s supposed to figure out how to run straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do this .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes , like it &apos;s got .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some of them are using our software to do that , and we &apos;re going to just see some of our <unk> in some big <unk> in some big <unk> .
we thought it was just going to hold balance .
here &apos;s how you learn to go to the <unk> -- how most of you know .
but i have to say , i will never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are absolutely essential for empathy .
if you are the lonely , you write a new york times column , and then they get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;ve done today is reported by frustration .
some stories are just to be honest , and yet , is that .
it <unk> . nobody has bought it .
there &apos;s a frontier that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft &apos;s word , ok . if you have a new , blank document document in word -- that could happen .
but i think there are actually two <unk> .
the other products were made by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple <unk> .
and <unk> , if someone writes a <unk> writes -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; leak me . &quot;
but when i looked at the <unk> technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the face of <unk> species , i made a lot of worry about the <unk> .
and to cut the danger of these new things , we need to think of the capacity of the individuals , which will give them the access to <unk> power .
i think the challenge that we face is -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to develop these <unk> with the background that we design from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , they have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last two of a little investment fund -- it took 400 million dollars so it &apos;s quite remarkable .
and if you &apos;re using the concept of companies , you can see a lot of <unk> -- the effects of the market -- to make feedback .
12 years ago , i started to <unk> myself , and i shifted my research in this direction .
wonderful and <unk> things .
there are ice underneath the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form .
it &apos;s actually so much energy in this cave in this cave , that there are actually a big number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that there have lots of traits that people and other organisms used to be used as a habitat habitat .
whenever you go to a destination , it needs to be a set of steps to get out of the time to get out of it .
and so it &apos;s also about archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> were made about it , and it was suffering under a tremendous <unk> .
that means before we could start to digitize the <unk> <unk> to digitize the book .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the electrons around the speed of light around the speed of the speed .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> was a son called alexander the big , and they lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , <unk> institutions have their data and more more .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most <unk> <unk> of the 1700s .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for what ?
she has four balconies .
a <unk> scheme is that a lot of these things from japan -- you &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was an object that i couldn &apos;t get into the fingers , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of the taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not necessarily the same thing that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold for <unk> real dollars .
this is really interesting in what &apos;s been able to measure them .
well , i could design a game called <unk> , by having a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if there are real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and what is shocking .
and i want to tell you a quick story , in 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how powerful engagement is transformed by the psychological and the psychological insights that we get when we see people .

this is a <unk> that i &apos;ve got two years ago , and that was in one of the great projects that i &apos;ve been involved and my company .
but i &apos;m going to close to the beginning of the process , three very <unk> .
if we are so good , what we should do is we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an active manifestation , which is absolutely <unk> by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
the architectural implementation was , <unk> said , simple .
and this is the actual <unk> .
the second technology that we use , we &apos;re using things that you know from the <unk> of one opera .
here you see the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to draw stories , in some ways .
one of these projects is about a year and a half a year .
these are the images that automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera down to the neck .
you can see a timeline that showed you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . you know .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if she was just a year , what would you find the next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money deserve and open a business . &quot;
and as she said , he had told you that he wanted to be , and he had a <unk> chance .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , i have absolutely benefits .
it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then the communication of <unk> .
very funny people , if lol lol is that .
you don &apos;t do that .
if someone was seen in 1973 on a black board of 1993 , the <unk> had a little bit different from the time of &quot; love , &quot; but he had understood what was there .
i am about the <unk> , and i wished to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work next week at the whitney , at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan is not an existential threat to global security .
and the same thing is true for the forces .
instead there was a <unk> of optimism bias .
diplomats are diplomats in <unk> .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we were in bosnia and kosovo , the secret to our success in the great part of our humility -- in the <unk> way of our <unk> .
rory , they mentioned libya .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to show you how to look at what it looks like .
there &apos;s also <unk> <unk> that are going to be <unk> , but if they <unk> these <unk> , they &apos;re going to be used for a different kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . that &apos;s a difficult problem for reasons that i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another very , very interesting connection , very interesting connection , and this is what you want to do is valuable information to lead a precious information on a general kind of evil .
so i think it has the minimal food that we probably can do to make things .
and we decided that we can &apos;t be so much in terms of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book called &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> with kansas ? &quot;
so we need to ask ourselves why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t have a lot of people with people who are not like that .
so we can think about things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only half , if i say that you can &apos;t believe you in the hospital , if you arrive at a <unk> , no previous <unk> , mri and <unk> <unk> .
then he turned home to his students .
within a few years , in the late 19th century , early 20th century suddenly the physician was trying to put a diagnosis on a diagnosis of a diagnosis .
between the perception of the patient and the physicians in terms of the best best services and the physicians in terms of the best best way .
another experience i did in texas , before i did , at stanford , it was affected me .
the bad news is that we don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t . see ? you can do that . &quot;
i remember so many of the big ones , <unk> , <unk> eyes , the <unk> of this ritual .
some call us <unk> , a rather <unk> term .
in this case , we have the case .
for you , back here , this is , &quot; then , then a miracle !
and there were no way to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
it &apos;s hard to move the dead to an answer .
my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> , wrote the book &quot; the big bang . &quot;
and now you open your eyes .
you can open it up , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it turns out to the thinking that these guys , most of the most , you know what they do for their livelihood .
everybody thought that impossible .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and this is something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need anybody .
hugo <unk> has not invented the <unk> <unk> and middle class in venezuela , and it &apos;s not invented it .
and it goes on .
they connect people together .
the reason ? the modern medicine is used to be a 60 years old .
there &apos;s a catch .
it makes him <unk> times faster than 5,000 times cheaper , and over 400 times <unk> than our <unk> counterparts .
my experience with the islamic world are quite different .
there &apos;s a character for b.
and why does sex work with babies , and why do babies mean all the time an erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret to the <unk> .
particularly , particularly about this description of the other , or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in desire .
this is her <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , which is natural instinct .
there &apos;s a desire to desire . this is a study curiosity , <unk> .
you know , there &apos;s an <unk> space that affects each other .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this is perfect .
ok .
it &apos;s usually played in smaller rooms .
so early <unk> some digits are <unk> .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , these <unk> that we do ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned himself to me , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s me !
how do we solve these three problems that i want to get here to the language ?
albert einstein -- i was just a talk about somebody when i gave a talk at princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what does it happen in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later : &quot; rare , so powerful minds with so powerful minds of authority christ . &quot;
or he was what he said .
i &apos;m not going to talk about the <unk> nor <unk> <unk> .
but you need to sit about 10 minutes and a woman in the arm , which is not there .
i was never in .
harvest <unk> .
with tears , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman in front of president <unk> and says , how she and her siblings , their parents died in war .
we go in rural areas , and everything we do is what we do in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i &apos;d like to look at 20 years of now , and see that there &apos;s another <unk> girl , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> girl on the ted stage .
lg : pardon .
licklider knows , computers can do the necessary <unk> to make insights and make decisions .
each other is recorded by increasing sensors : your phone card , your credit card , your computer card . it &apos;s a lot of data , and we get the opportunity to understand it .
these records were human <unk> .
by having a <unk> process , which is introduced to 40 people over three months , to a simple assignment for three people in 40 months . all of these are <unk> .
we should stop looking outside .
dinner with my wife and the children home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i didn &apos;t fit a time .
she became a much larger dog than i thought .
this impacts all affect us .
the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
think of <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina , we have more common .
and you &apos;ve probably done this , and if not , they &apos;re going to have to do this .
help me get green to new black and help you help me to make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch a interactive map for my mom .
but i &apos;m a bit skeptical about what these <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , put it on a pile and the stack of <unk> determine the behavior of different characters in a game or a story , in this case , the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to learn .
so when kids are creating these projects , they learn very important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a background , is the thought that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think that this thought that great cars is a soul is very sane . they all know that . you see a car with the first sight . you know how much it is .
this is one of my favorite <unk> , which is really our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it &apos;s cheaper to be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven million elizabeth <unk> house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt like each other on this day , we were very close , and we <unk> the concept of the real nature of real <unk> and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring it to boston .
there &apos;s just a little lab .
now , we have clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that will give us this medicines in the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to remember is that we have a hundred billion galaxies with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer to that , we have a good theory that can explain if this is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so it &apos;s going to be , although the universe lasts forever , and ordinary matter and radiation can always be <unk> , some of the thermal fluctuations , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give big fluctuations .
it cools off .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe that you accept and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t tolerate .
now i want to see something out there , like me , to say to the africans and the poor who who are struggling with their dreams .
no matter what movement i was in my real world was just using my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my <unk> , and he sat down a little bit of <unk> on the table that shows good <unk> .
so the camera doesn &apos;t really understand my movement , but it &apos;s also able to understand what things i hold in my hand .
and why is just <unk> ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is carlos <unk> , king of spain .
this is the third park in rio , june june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to go deep down under the earth to build the <unk> .
let me give you a quick example .
almost every year we have this terrible <unk> .
we &apos;re in terms of average in terms of the <unk> in the city of the city .
a city of the future is a city that has no one of these great community that cities are .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwinian <unk> of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make them beautiful , so they &apos;re kind of <unk> , so it makes you joy , you just see .
and some of them are too big to use them for the battles .
so our strong response to images , to the expression of feelings of art , the beauty of music before the sky will have us and our offspring , as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here &apos;s how the computer can see the environment , and there you can &apos;t see the <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> the driver &apos;s actually with red leds , so you can see what &apos;s going on .
let me see if you can avoid the mark .
or for blind people , in <unk> , in <unk> , in education , and in the office and in the office .
a more subtle <unk> had begun . the <unk> that normal people don &apos;t hear , and i heard them , meant that something could not agree with me .
my mental <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , <unk> , and physical and sexuality , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , and i was saying , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , is easier to cure . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> : if the social change starts , it can &apos;t be more <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than on mars , although mars is also a much more <unk> and more interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were filled with contempt .
because it &apos;s <unk> that the way of life can life outside , it has tremendous benefits compared to a planet on a planet .
there was another object , this <unk> of furniture with these creatures with creatures and <unk> and naked -- quite <unk> .
so the first projects were modest , but they took technology and turned it into the technology and turned it into things that people could use in a new way of using a new way .
the other thing is , the <unk> is about <unk> , is that we decided we decided to <unk> all the gadgets , this whole <unk> , and trying to do it as beautiful as possible .
so we ended up with y water . so this is another example of where everything comes together in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas that brand , it &apos;s all intimately interconnected .
this is my <unk> anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to take it back . it was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects , the stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly <unk> , brilliant wife and brilliant wife , became famous .

look at these young girls who return to school after shell acid in their faces .
the world was given to layma was a world war in war .
then the situation will be able .
they need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation who grow up in a world where everything is <unk> and some of our best talks on a screen .
it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if you wonder why it &apos;s really interesting , you need to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it is a country that is divided by the <unk> .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to change changes .
let me give you an example : in turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very <unk> republic , we had something i call <unk> , which should protect universities .
now , if i was the only person that way , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims have seen as muslims , they were independent , <unk> .
so the e.u. process , the efforts of turkey , the efforts of turkey , in the turkey , in the turkey of the men , are supported to be supported by the <unk> nations .
there &apos;s a very big nose that didn &apos;t seem to feel that as if they &apos;re connected to something connected .
if a scientist today , a century later , neurons would be able to look at neurons , and then they &apos;re light from the inside of the inside , rather than you .
carl <unk> : glimpses of the inside of our brains
but this trend is less clear .
but for many of the parts of africa , it &apos;s a colleague of me , &quot; the <unk> on the night was given to the right time , so that the genocide was going to start on the right time . &quot;
and instead of <unk> that opportunity have local and international leaders and international leaders , and they have a <unk> from the second <unk> , the events of <unk> , september 2001 , and the wars in <unk> and iraq .

<unk> had moved across continents . the great migrations .
some of the mammals went back into water .

mo <unk> from canada , from the u.s. , and in the u.k. , <unk> us and call us , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i say , &quot; last year we had the fortune to 10,000 10,000 . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men involved , in every age , is so important and important , and i think so much more important than the money we &apos;ve collected .
he was able to see what his forest was happening , his environment , because his grandfather was under him under his <unk> when he was two years old , and the way he began to teach his people to teach his people .
and when i thought about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our <unk> would answer , if you ask the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and to human our world .
it works with people like <unk> .
for a lifetime , through everything , about the cultural revolution , and all that after that came , it was collected today over 8 million parts in his museum , the contemporary chinese history document .

this man is angry , because somebody across the stairs <unk> , and basically -- you know , <unk> seem to be a theme here .
and she &apos;s also <unk> with george <unk> , so i don &apos;t think of it .
td : since my youngest childhood and after that , i had a lot of different qualities , and when i was young , it was so that my way was that my way was <unk> .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process is to an inner process .
td : lakshmi worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone everything else that she has done , and i &apos;ve got a very <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a very nervous while , and i was very nervous .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and they &apos;ve learned the other ones that we &apos;ve learned in reality .
if i say , &quot; i mean the advice for <unk> .
but nobody thinks that it &apos;s very effective to be very effective if there &apos;s an actual outbreak .
the biggest part of the pandemic was in the veteran &apos;s administration of bush , in the 2008 of bush , with anthrax and the threat of <unk> .
we know that the virus will be -- it &apos;s going to be a different virus .
but in the scientific community there , there is a debate debate about what percentage of <unk> is between people through <unk> and coughing , and how much things happens .
some of the poorest countries , most of the experience have had h5n1 with h5n1 , have breast camps full of drugs that are already .
and i think , even our leaders would say in this case that we have a lot of .
i &apos;m looking forward to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have been developed one of them developed -- as rapid <unk> .
and they &apos;ve been similar to people who were similar to people with similar bacterial infections .
just don &apos;t pay attention to how much fun you &apos;ve got to do , but also how to interact like the <unk> completely the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please put it with me a <unk> .
i <unk> myself with a young juggler from a <unk> force , and he <unk> a <unk> to sell three clubs .
so since i played with my childhood , i played with <unk> and climbing , so the case is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going 16 .
manhattan is no longer an infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i stay in the middle .
she became one , i dialed the victory .
because the leaves leaves and branches is very dark in the very <unk> and very quietly .
i , and my colleagues of the <unk> are interested in the dynamics of the <unk> that &apos;s in the forest .
we &apos;re advising ourselves with the media ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then the students come into our <unk> , and they have their own <unk> with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to learn to the frog to grow the frog , which is a high from an endangered endangered <unk> in the states of washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; you know what you &apos;re hidden in front of you . &quot;
that &apos;s why we can see a rising demand , and that &apos;s why we see .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you need to believe me . trust me . &quot;
that day , i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go underwater , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
in the breath , the air is in the <unk> , breathing air .
every one of the computer can do all the system , so if two of them , there are still reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat continues , over many miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people .
when we found it , we didn &apos;t even know what the family was heard , so we called him <unk> , so we called him <unk> &#91; after &#93; he came from one of his books .
oxygen toxicity is a <unk> and <unk> .
this means that every one and every one of you at least there knows a child that suffers from a <unk> .
and his communication and social interaction , and social interaction is that he could visit a normal school and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s like something that &apos;s like , if you &apos;re in it , you can &apos;t see it again .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you &apos;ll notice this day , one day you will hear about him , because it &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love over a lot of love he loved .
we , all of us , are that what happens when there is a <unk> hydrogen out of hydrogen and helium so long , that you start to wonder about their origins .
these <unk> prove that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to estimate the diversity , and the incredible scale of life on this planet , in the first time , has been able to estimate , to connect with life elsewhere .
it &apos;s going to be silicon as important as aluminum , and we &apos;re going to be able to push it down , and it &apos;s going to be sensitive to the moore &apos;s moore , so it &apos;s sensitive to moore &apos;s law .
and then we &apos;d like to make the <unk> search for the human <unk> .
so many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to explore the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> time .
while she <unk> with the ice <unk> , you put a extra extra pair of gloves in an oven , so you can get a new pair of gloves when your <unk> and your fingers are stiff .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> .
and our soldiers are not going to be happy to <unk> pipelines to <unk> , if they were actually sent to the service to the american <unk> .
you can still take that further , and the efficiency has almost triple triple with some <unk> improvements and at the cost of the major <unk> .
we could build bigger cars that would pay attention to safety , but easy to them .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we don &apos;t have to protect for protecting our <unk> and the other .
and this is by taking the <unk> of the time to the <unk> of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to make <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> ; the <unk> can be the same way that the internet has gone to the internet .
it cannot just act a giant <unk> conspiracy conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we &apos;ve received .
we hope that it &apos;s really stable .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
at the end of the end , he was a <unk> <unk> , named van meegeren who sold his beautiful vermeer to a prize , who sold about 10 million dollars <unk> .
according to his <unk> , &quot; he looked like him for the first time he ever discovered that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it depends on . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find , how do you find them , or romantic move , depends on what you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each one of those three objects has a value beyond what it is , because of his history .
but i don &apos;t want to copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to his <unk> in a subway station in washington d.c. , looking at a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock hurts less , because they &apos;re a little bit of it .
and if you squint , you can see that there may be a kind of a political <unk> .
she <unk> that you have a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find , of course , is that people who eat vegetables and olive oil .
the <unk> is one of the most remarkable things in the world medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> end , if you give a drug in a such high dose , there &apos;s more side effects , and that &apos;s going to be better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that we currently have no problem .
and very soon , they would have started this charcoal <unk> , <unk> around 2,000 , <unk> around <unk> , <unk> around , back to china and all around the world .
can you imagine how they feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , this is all knowledge .
there is this thing , the <unk> of the world , and it &apos;s from the middle of the united states .
and what you see ? you &apos;re christians .
man , americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
so it &apos;s <unk> . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everyone else are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them got down the morning , and it &apos;s hugging and said , &quot; honey , i went back after .
everything has changed .
and all this has tremendous implications for the world .
i think thomas jefferson has really quite good words .
in the audience in the audience , in the audience , in the audience , why have a bigger budget , as a <unk> , and that &apos;s because it &apos;s <unk> easier to other languages and cultures , and so the market for these films .
but it will happen within this century .
this is not the <unk> of the united states , which is about a million , but gdp in the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
also , like everyone here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a lifelong obligation to the growing up coast of the gulf coast on the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet that affects our living environment , is just by believing and guess .
one has been for tens of thousands or millions of years .
we need to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : saving life on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the genome of the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion pairs .
the dawn of de-extinction falls into this category .
so this is <unk> <unk> chicken .
and this is a program for <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional theme . some people are up .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
i did my own comics , which was another way to tell stories , through words and through pictures .
and we sat in short , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
using your own style . record your own style .
&quot; well , jarrett , i have your <unk> .
i &apos;m going to publish a children &apos;s book called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> : the <unk> who <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us all the time , psychological , psychological and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which was built recently by the u.k. <unk> by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by it .
people who say they don &apos;t leave the team next to this team because the noise may be and the other .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , one of the <unk> of his life , his life in a suitcase with himself , and the <unk> and reality , and not in that position , both too <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and a half and a half and a half later , what was as a <unk> of <unk> talented actors .
i know that theater connects us to connect us .
now the time we can use the diversity of our talent to make a smart , important and extraordinary work . and <unk> .
if you look around in the bathroom , you can see some of some products , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but even toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- it used to be used to inject it into fold .
i &apos;ve found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid , you &apos;ve got a long and <unk> year . &quot;
i told you , you know , you should be <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;ve given the feeling to be somebody , in a time that i didn &apos;t feel like this one .
they &apos;re working on the 29th , so she &apos;s going to work in the side of the <unk> .
hundreds of verbs can behave .
you can see that as the language of thought , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the key thing is , why are you polite , are polite requests , <unk> and <unk> so often ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could be used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it makes it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what you won &apos;t do is to convince myself ?
all these different rollers . can you imagine an argument that you &apos;re involved in , but in the audience , and you see ?
or -- and this is the <unk> part of me : we want them to be <unk> into the world of nature . we put a <unk> and find the masters of the <unk> in nature that could inspire us .
it changed everything . from there , these engineers were not going to go into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the <unk> national lab .
this would be <unk> for solar cells , if you could do without <unk> .
it &apos;s not just because it &apos;s just a subset of the elements of the elements in the <unk> .
and feel that feedback is very important .
you can &apos;t count , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
in south korea , indonesia are almost half a million companies .
because , as the <unk> notices , smaller <unk> <unk> are related to <unk> growth .
and there are no exceptions in all the world .
people <unk> whether this <unk> and this miracle .
i have a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , even <unk> cows on my <unk> , and i want paper paper to <unk> .
we first got it .
what does that mean ?
when i started working with them , i noticed that they were incredibly well adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they ended up in the campus and the campus left -- and i &apos;m sure glad to come down there -- a few years later , came back and realized that the crows have always remembered .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they &apos;re teaching each other things .
squirrel for example would come back to the peanut and again .
but there were three problems , three mysteries that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know , there &apos;s the <unk> of the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of sound .
it &apos;s about 10 million <unk> .
and over here , we see , with the words of the radiologists , israel <unk> , &quot; as the <unk> of the penis in a way . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yeah , but i &apos;d like to eat the end , if you don &apos;t have anything . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book that was supposed to be <unk> , and there was a <unk> maria <unk> , the trouble with the conception of conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read them what she said , because i think it &apos;s pretty beautiful .
i think that i find very unfortunate . not because i want to use it . i wanted to see it .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now , i would have thought to that moment that &apos;s the age of 50 , one of the skills that i really had , was , my shoes .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yeah . it doesn &apos;t seem to know how to <unk> the different colors of it .
but i can see in their faces that they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have something fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i drop some things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all here .
my father was a <unk> , so i was therefore interesting .
that song as a mere fact .
i think , &quot; wait , yeah , yeah , yeah , i put the wheels on the wheels , &quot; i made the <unk> wheels , and i made them and -- you see , could i give my <unk> ?
it sounds simple , but i think that we &apos;re in denial of our society and culture with the <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> himself , and he was really quite proud of it .
boy , i love this thing .
the consequences of the planet is about seven billion people living .
very , very proud of him , he was sitting on the cushy seat , which was a real <unk> seat that he had had his <unk> , and the beautiful <unk> around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- well , in purpose , the original thing is something better .
i looked at the healthy mass of the left , and i realized that she was lost , <unk> all of what i didn &apos;t do , but not anymore .
and then i started thinking , as many times before , asking how my life would be different , if this man didn &apos;t hurt me , if my genes were another part of the experience .
i was , but i was , but i was a <unk> , i guess , i guess i made myself .
i had a lot easier to invent : this turkish <unk> to four words and me again to do my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yeah , contrast .
we work with the machine <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural interface of the control , so that the interaction with the robot is more intuitive .
and yet i made this idea .
after i recognized this , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some people have even credentials the speaker , like nathan <unk> art , or the one of tim ferriss that occasionally seem to be a <unk> .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes it .
so this time i paid 25 cents , because i thought the assignment was something harder .
and yet , there was one thing that would all be , the expansion needed to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in mind , because i &apos;m now going to call them three <unk> of string theory .
the <unk> went on about 10 feet tall .
and he worked for decades to explain that number , but it didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes have extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by creating powerful telescopes in the sky , are a handful of <unk> photons -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , billions years .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it , and we really want them to really work , and even more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri &apos;s so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know here .
in the next moment , the phone is not going to go to the tv , <unk> men in the street there are <unk> .
it was a very prominent meeting of reporters who had been working on the war , the staff of aid agencies , and of course , of course , brave and brave people of sarajevo .
if i ask myself , why i &apos;m going to do a <unk> , why i &apos;m going to stay here .
but my profession this testimony <unk> , and this is the <unk> , the core of the thing , for us .
even before a goal appears to seem to be a destination with the joystick <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to aurora &apos;s target .
we basically <unk> the animals so they learned to control these <unk> and objects in the virtual world .
in a experiment that we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was done the <unk> .
please raise your hand .
the last reason is that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , in average , one of seven women are born at birth of a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he <unk> as a <unk> of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good , investing in education from girls in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the equivalent of a bird .
this is all the <unk> around our <unk> tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even that image is going to be impression , <unk> , like something from the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so one of these things was that we could have gotten into small <unk> .
they put their arrowheads up , and they say , &quot; i want to go to the arrowheads . we &apos;re going to share 50 to 50 .
there are places on this island where they &apos;re all three or four miles into a new language .
when 27 individuals of these 27 member of these 27 centers , their 23 languages <unk> , they &apos;ll tell you a army of <unk> <unk> <unk> to all be prepared to all the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they have language .
and what interests me most of the most interested is the invisible space between a text and the same image , and how the image is changing by the text , and the text through the picture .
this is <unk> <unk> , which is above the bottom of the atlantic ocean and north america with europe .
you turn it to the negative .
but by the idea of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> served eight years of a 10 and a half <unk> sentence in arizona , in arizona , <unk> <unk> of a <unk> boy on a <unk> boy .
these are the people themselves .
and they brought them to texas .
and now , you &apos;re driving with the food where you &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the length of the space that makes it look like this .
this is something called <unk> , the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in part of the legacy of the legacy , of the <unk> , the pursuit of happiness for <unk> efforts , it &apos;s going to be <unk> by <unk> aspects of the individual , and can &apos;t be found in reality .
a <unk> in the science of happiness is that happiness and no <unk> is not <unk> in a closed-loop continuum .
it starts in <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a three year-old old baby .
in the animal kingdom there is only one way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you vote rats ?
once the rat understood that , let &apos;s make it harder .
you can actually cure it , even people who are hiv-positive .
with knowing that a patient , the microscopic dose , to 15 people up to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- 15 healthy people , you can be sure that we &apos;ve saved a lot of life .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is , if i just watch another person &apos;s being touched , why am i not confused , and you literally have seen this <unk> of the naked watch , how someone is being touched ?
thank you beautiful . i &apos;m here today today .
it &apos;s actually not about the <unk> , but the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a <unk> by the way in the lab at the lab .
even every single one of us has a single story to tell the <unk> .
we need to be as good as the campaign to tackle this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we went to women and death through heart disease and death of heart disease , she wrote an op-ed for the new england journal of medicine .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women , whose high rate is in the heart of the heart , every time , if we assemble something , it &apos;s a little bit of radiation , ask , &quot; is this test ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they did what they said they were <unk> , and they &apos;re campaigning .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish , they don &apos;t feel a local .
what does that mean for us ?
over the course of three years , we took every day eight to 10 hours to take a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first iteration that was a little bit more than a year ago that really surprised us .
and lastly , my son is in a <unk> <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project , philip <unk> and <unk> roy and <unk> are here .
and there is a fascinating dynamic in play .
this is the first time that our son took more than two steps in once -- captured in the movie .
and this is an important to <unk> question , because the better we understand how the brain could make sense , better , we can communicate and work better .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh , i have a strong or emotional response to the stuff . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is , our teams <unk> the whole way to paint the whole <unk> on a big wall .
that &apos;s the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but it &apos;s also about the possibility of thinking .
so it doesn &apos;t make it .
if you translate that into the construction industry , if you have a <unk> , a window is broken , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that must be .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;ve continued to put it .
are we just stupid ?
you can actually read it in two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so you can say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police is waiting for the side of the firemen to cut the car into the pieces to the body .
and that &apos;s enough to the present in the present in the united states with the <unk> in the united states , which is a eye of the divine .
all this leads us to -- <unk> , just to name this : what we &apos;re doing most of the most thing is to use digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right through the stroke of the brain on the right .
this is a very , very low level to be discharged from the health care system .
he was holding my jaw in the right position as he <unk> my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and an innovator , who is fascinated in the other way , in the consciousness , whether it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , or a blind , and a <unk> movement .
now i had to put in the course of the dark years that followed me what i stayed when everything that was done , disappeared .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , they spend time with simon .
and these were the developing world : they had large families and a relatively quick life .
and these are on this side , a large <unk> of africa .
and then deng xiaoping came to deng xiaoping and raised money to china and raised the country .
a search for that we can copy the data into a <unk> format and the world in the world , and what &apos;s going to hear if we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has been explained life after it came out , but what was the essence of life ?
and i learned to francis crick .
but there was the literature in literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girl married me .
so you can compare to the dna of these things , and we compare <unk> areas .
and so close to me , i &apos;ll tell you that we have 20 people with schizophrenia .
on average average , it costs two million dollars and it takes 18 months when they win .
first , they don &apos;t care about the patent , but against the <unk> .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to leave you with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot;
so the fathers were in a place where they move their daughters to play their daughters , their <unk> and their hand .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left to the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
you can &apos;t see the enemy of most of the time , and we needed another approach to polio polio than we had done it .
it has helped , <unk> <unk> , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how to make polio a halt .
dj : we found this <unk> in all sorts of animals , especially with the big cats .
and to our surprise , it became a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many ways a symbol of inspiration has become a symbol of inspiration that &apos;s our work .
it was incredibly amazing when she took it to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> , the <unk> , it reminds me of a human way of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman and wife , as a community and we need to keep on it .
it seems to be obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun sun is small and mobile , but it &apos;s worth to remember what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s because in middle world &apos;s always been there .
the nature of this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them there , and there &apos;s no consensus on their <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , as we see it in middle world , <unk> and <unk> .
people as they treat machines like , scientifically , scientifically , scientifically , but it &apos;s a <unk> waste of waste , if you want to guess what the question is going to be next .
over night , i became <unk> <unk> at the <unk> age of 40 years .
over a <unk> , i &apos;ll allow you to allow me to see this <unk> , video of robot robot to see video and send orders in a <unk> press .
with the help of people , we can make this dream .
in oceanography , for example , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , by the <unk> , the dolphins that send dolphins out the dolphins .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s some lessons that you can learn from it .
but usually we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
it &apos;s now at 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also assume that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- which is really sad , when you think that this is the most common language of the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this image , you think , &quot; why should i care ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world out there and its place in it .
they would make wealth and safety violence , religious violence and make sure that states are not going to <unk> terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war is that 20 million people took life -- until today , the civil war war worldwide .
<unk> sen , who is this guy , &quot; i would have all of this money , but i spent all this time , the american man who had my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done mostly the same thing , i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso &apos;s chicken , which is actually in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was at the university in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century is the <unk> search of medicine , which is the same thing .
so people were really big .
when the <unk> started to become less less , i was always <unk> , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember that as a kid to any line up to each line ?
at 18 and 19 , i slept the night .
once again , i &apos;m going to get something depressed and something <unk> .
so many of us , it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s in the next few years to build a new world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where the world worked in the treatment of the familiar problems with the familiar problems with the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you <unk> the impossible , you make it possible .
but we have reached one agreement to climate change .
and there was crying .
the <unk> does something remarkable : they &apos;re using two ingredients , proteins and water that &apos;s in their <unk> to create a material that &apos;s exceptional , which is hard to create a technical fibers .
or you &apos;re <unk> beautiful things like this , if the camera can catch it .
here &apos;s how it &apos;s taken off the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s called the <unk> and the round of applause and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him some some of the other decisions .
what should i do ? &quot;
at the end of this , unprecedented knight , heather knight data , a <unk> , which is far more than <unk> <unk> -- and he &apos;s taking the feedback of his audience and how to deal with the answer of his audience .
stanley <unk> , inventor , inventor <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> that there were between two types of people going up with just five to seven steps .
how does it change our view of relations with all sorts of <unk> ?
but there was a <unk> <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where it might be that i could have this ring in the ear .
uh , my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father , who decided that she needed false papers .
this sense of responsibility about the life of others , despite his young age of 17 years , and he was also his fault to his fault , because he was out of a camp , while his friends were left , he kept his whole life .
and as my <unk> and my <unk> were given to the <unk> , so , in some cases , my father false papers .
i asked him , in the face of the victim , he had to be , if he ever got the <unk> .
we are growing by a couple of millions of people on the seven billion people we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> at <unk> level , which is a <unk> for the next <unk> , which is seemingly in a good state .
if you <unk> the forests of the forests , the boundary of the <unk> , you <unk> the capacity of the <unk> , stable .
with the knowledge of <unk> , fishers , the great great barrier reef , <unk> and scientists , that the great barrier reef is <unk> is <unk> below .
but the drama is , of course , is that transformative change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason , why i &apos;m here today , because i really love the media .
this is a <unk> of a race from far developed <unk> .
first of all , he uses an ancient way of making the <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which is a whole new technology that was a whole new technology .
and through the process of sugar in black , i made portraits of them .
it was very big images , and i took them with a very big camera , a <unk> camera .
i &apos;m interested in <unk> , especially in a bad <unk> , <unk> .
and on the back of the back , a sequence is the chimps .
so we can ask : there is a general difference between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of life today .
so we can then ask ourselves to the same questions , how to neanderthal , have been with the ancestors of people today ?
there are a lot of people who designed their own imagination , like this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
in my belief , the airplane of the future is his own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> are growing in 3d printers in 3d printers , and they &apos;re embedded in a <unk> way , and the forces that are in their components .
they don &apos;t speak . but particularly , they were extraordinary <unk> of the world around them , from their environment and by the people .
they would be <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you can see a video .
you have the feeling that the research that you &apos;ve been involved with , really has an effect on reality that you can actually prevent these experiences that i can actually prevent my way on this area .
then you pick up .
<unk> <unk> you get you in a linear body body -- chin to the <unk> , arms <unk> over your <unk> .
they made all the same way that we had taught them .
and after the battle , you put this in these places , and what you do is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; to give you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
also , people have changed .
i asked , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a <unk> .
and she showed the left work to me , like the problem of this image , which was the way that they were represented by the idea of how black represented .
and it &apos;s really in this sense of <unk> that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m doing .
now , there &apos;s a kind of obvious statement up there .
and the kids said , &quot; how to do this . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long you did you before you decided that you have nothing ? &quot;
their <unk> increases in 50 to 50 , which is going to be <unk> in a <unk> biotechnology .
it was 76 percent . the test for two months later , the result is 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be <unk> da vinci .
these are <unk> .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness on the <unk> side of the location , a <unk> of mirrors that were on the moon .
if i had to reduce the entire story on an image , what would it be ?
now i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything became blue .
i want to tell you two stories . they &apos;re both playing in africa .
it &apos;s another one that &apos;s on the intersection of health and business .
so let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> , which we have , and find out what price people would pay for the people , so they would have the election .
thank you .
the <unk> was : if my mom couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we raised two <unk> and 10 tv .
so the little bit of <unk> came out of his tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s getting slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models that i work with .
tissue from <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and this is actually going to be the key part , these models of <unk> .
thank you .
trying to fly them just like the attempt to take an arrow to shoot with the <unk> , and it was hard work , and boy , boy , i have a lot of respect for nature .
so let &apos;s take the other side .
we work on projects -- even recyclable developments , as <unk> as <unk> -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university los angeles .
be careful , just like wood , just like wood .
now i was not trying to be <unk> .
they go forever forever .
these are about two billion .
it &apos;s going to require it after the estimate of about three years of <unk> .
don &apos;t forget that one of them .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time we live in the human mind and machines can win machines .
i clearly have mass . where do you come from ?
it &apos;s too fear that the way that the <unk> is <unk> in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence of <unk> is that this cancer is transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity and collect some samples from jonas &apos; tumor , and a few samples from other parts of the body .
they brought him to the veterinarian , and they discovered something <unk> .
ultimately , cancer is a <unk> of the ability of our cells to share with our cells and their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait .
and that &apos;s the third reason , why is not a low expectation .
but they didn &apos;t feel the numbers on them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion isn &apos;t going to break , if we &apos;re aware of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which is incremental , and more than half of the world &apos;s population to harbor more than half the world &apos;s global economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of <unk> .
after the soviets , sputnik had <unk> , it was , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you go to japan or new delhi , or <unk> your view of china will be something different than when they live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we will be able to put this into a larger historical context .
how do we define our national interests , so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this has increased the responsibility of the responsibility to <unk> a stable <unk> .
they &apos;re addicted to each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after the time , the law has collapsed , you can &apos;t even get access to land .
it was dignity by its own , after conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my new orleans .
the military has been understood . it &apos;s called the climate change , which is security and stability as governments to discuss the world , how to respond .
it allows them to be more productive so that they can afford to insurance so that they can afford insurance .
and these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions when we feel able to plan for a <unk> world .
listen to the chinese students , english students practice .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the <unk> world with <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , which we &apos;re trying to do logically , and we take the hypothetical seriously , so we wonder , what could be more .
luria looked at people , before they <unk> into the scientific age , and he found out that these people were resistant to become resistant to a clear world of the concrete world .
there was always the north pole , &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you be killed ? &quot;
you could say a <unk> .
it feels like me in a colony of angels . &quot;
and she <unk> me to make a degree .
it &apos;s still the red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifices , this film <unk> .
i &apos;m one of her <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; this is serious .
we were all mad at them , &quot; why do you do that ?
it &apos;s going to be much real if you read it . &quot;
we had always been playing the game after the school for weeks , about seven weeks ago , and we had all 50 to <unk> crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people had been good for jobs and <unk> jobs .
it &apos;s like your own little connection .
if i put all three legs in it , in the three quarters of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very poetic case -- this old <unk> and this old <unk> and this old <unk> is very simple in an old <unk> .
this is possible when you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can school in a high school or a state school -- a leaf , a ruler and a pen , a ruler and a pen , no , no .
what we &apos;re doing is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little straw of what you &apos;re doing is these two corners here , it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
it was a lot of passengers on the ship , and they were getting bored , so they didn &apos;t untie the <unk> .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> <unk> <unk> simple , but amazing plans to turn waste in really <unk> , well as they can build basic principles of science , as they learn .
it was a big challenge , and there were actually examples of biology that was a lot of evidence .
and there are a few examples of projects that are going to consciously imitate ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can create a place of traffic control into a turn that open space for people who will connect with food and waste waste into opportunities .
this photograph was made by the day magazine , and just a year later , she looked like this .
if you <unk> seawater , the first is the calcium carbonate .
no , you &apos;ve got to <unk> out of people &apos;s visions with visions of explore . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish , and i &apos;m a very important .
but the actual <unk> was that there were lots of men who wanted to look at me .
very few of us have the ability to be completely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel until it &apos;s not a <unk> .
i was trying to be like <unk> .
because you remember my <unk> : you &apos;ve got to get a <unk> of 700 points and no one .
most of them . they &apos;re 33 years old at average 33 years old , not eight years old , and when we look at the most <unk> demographics of the <unk> , the <unk> of this morning , older adults .
imagine that vision is very , very good .
these worsening many other benefits , even many other benefits in terms of attention , and a sense of attention , which is also clear , is our ability to track objects .
i want to ask you to remember that outcome , and it &apos;s in the context of a different group of <unk> , a group that is actually looking up in our society , which is made of people who are doing high rates .
so let me give you this one step with a task called a mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of calculation .
let &apos;s just take all kinds of programs in the field that we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project , i &apos;m not sure if it was going to work .
wolfram alpha knows about lots and lots of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its kind of precise , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> developed capacity to do a lot of just a few lines .
so , with the physical <unk> , we &apos;re basically used to go to the world and see that specific materials make sense for certain technology and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about the discovery that there are <unk> universes with incredibly simple rules , and also the general relativity and gravitation and at least evidence of quantum relativity .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i lost more of these things , as teachers , and teachers , the <unk> , hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
there &apos;s a woman that was a woman , she had no right on property , and automatically , all my family owned , anyway my father , so he was quite .
and the day before the actual ceremony were dancing , we were excited , and didn &apos;t slept all night .
he was white and it was in a village that didn &apos;t even <unk> <unk> . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , and i would come back and do anything that they would ask for me after that .
if it was pregnant before you were pregnant , the mother was responsible for doing it .
as we speak here , 125 girls will never be <unk> .
consumers , the 72 percent of the american gdp represent , actually , the same as the banks and businesses of finance , their <unk> , their <unk> , their own lives , even of legal and risks that connect us when we move forward .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is the whole phenomenon of fact that we &apos;re actually <unk> and basically future education , the future children of our homes are <unk> .
<unk> are about 48 percent up to cornell national percent .
we also observe a trend with a <unk> tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and more vulnerable than help the neighbors of neighbors .
we &apos;re also seeing a big <unk> .
the trend is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got the question , i am the only thing that does something like this ?
you could exploit them .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing in my life -- stories , novels , novels , and today i want to share with you a couple of stories about the art of storytelling and some supernatural creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could be <unk> . our hearts could be <unk> , and our <unk> could be <unk> when we were too long within our cultural <unk> .
there was the first time that i like to call it , &quot; raw <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , not a <unk> or <unk> . i &apos;m going to ask you why i do this . but i took them to invent my <unk> myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge contraption , because i was <unk> .
literature has to take us on the other side .
i could <unk> a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that &apos;s going to be a happy story , and in my next book , i write about a <unk> professor , professor in norway .
so you <unk> . you take the existing songs , cut them into little bits , shapes them into little bits , and then you get a new song , but this new song is clear old songs .
instead of using these laws and laws in the world , the more abstract comparison in the <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to wrap up what it &apos;s like . <unk> : the <unk> of the telephone , by giving a symbol of his finger .
it comes from the outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you figure out your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; she &apos;s in the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see these limb , sort of <unk> <unk> , which is from the limb .
our exploration of the solar system is taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single nucleus , with the <unk> that it circle around .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it &apos;s also , you know , <unk> ideas for us , across our place in the universe , and really the value of our home .
that &apos;s here . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with each click and any touch touch of the screen , we &apos;re like <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information over the digital forest .
when our daughter turned back to the <unk> , i asked them , &quot; it &apos;s going to musical school much value on musical hands ? &quot;
we can &apos;t even <unk> this .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much , i decided to talk about my 27 birthday , i decided i &apos;m not going to talk about a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ...
and i explained to a friend of a friend who &apos;s mind that i was john francis that i was running through the life that i didn &apos;t speak , and that would be the last time someone would translate my sign .
well , i <unk> my backpack again .
i started to talk back because i was <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was on each birthday thought about my silence , but i never worried about my decision , just my feet .
born and grew in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried that i would spend and back back to return .
i felt like that , because i had so much food , but my father died of hunger died .
but i believe that your gesture of love and how to be the life of another joseph can save thousands and thousands of other <unk> can change that still have the hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings to test new materials for buildings , but that was much more powerful than i expected to do and make an industrial <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help us , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , the government , contractors .
and then in the following year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in <unk> in japan .
so i wonder what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , even in the womb .
so what fetuses are learning is even the particular language that i &apos;ve been born in the world where you &apos;re born in .
it comes from a combination of which such as individually and strange , as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition in the womb for malnutrition ?
but you can also see it with other eyes .
this is the confidence in the <unk> is essential to any kind of <unk> .
the audience will become <unk> <unk> , which are all obvious , but not with what &apos;s going on front of your eyes . &quot;
and if it is a good story , it actually makes us a smile .
you may remember the <unk> <unk> , okay . at the time , as the greatest deal of all the time .
if you &apos;re a high animal at unesco , and somebody who tells you , &quot; what do you do in the world of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy that &apos;s actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is a matter .
for me , all the music became .
now , if i use my software using my software , the camera <unk> , and it &apos;s the place of <unk> in relation to the <unk> , and you &apos;ve already got a whiteboard .
i remember the poor poor things needed to eat -- eat , clothing , shelter -- which they didn &apos;t .
i actually felt a <unk> of shame <unk> .
now , since i heard him , i was excited for various reasons .
i didn &apos;t even asked for a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the poor story of the poor , and it &apos;s about something from us to get a chance to get into a traditional kind of <unk> , which is <unk> in a traditional way of a donation .
it &apos;s a very powerful combination , a very powerful combination .
now , at the moment , at the beginning of the beginning , the beginning and it &apos;s kind of <unk> for me very clear that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a tool .
what &apos;s the future of humanity ?
now , i turn to the second big question : are we alone , or there &apos;s other life in the universe ?
the answer to these big questions show that we &apos;ve done considerable progress in the last hundred years .
see this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate is doubling in even every 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> knows that &apos;s the <unk> law .
but what about them ? what &apos;s going to do it with you ?
they lock them up in the sky over the sky , and they &apos;re surrounded by people who would not agree with their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
older generations could not make these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was a <unk> <unk> million years ago .
we can learn a lot of learning .
and i &apos;m looking at <unk> and i &apos;m trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t let a kid , even one minister .
and secondly , she tells us that they had a <unk> gang , but some <unk> for the <unk> of trees .
until now , our knowledge came across the principle of adult individuals , because the fossils , the fossils , were missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> research is exploring the origin of humankind in the long ethiopia , and he talks about how he was the oldest skeleton of a <unk> child and what we learn in africa .
and if all of the rules are supposed to take , of course , you need an effective system for <unk> and <unk> , because we &apos;ve found we trust in all of everything .
she &apos;s looking at as high seas because the continent was <unk> <unk> .
we need to work a local work , but it &apos;s also <unk> .
we need to be a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
i think that was a pretty good idea .
so to tell you , i &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
and then finally , i think we need to think about whether this is our reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life , and for everything that comes out .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and <unk> , the right solution to how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times to write and explain how it works .
of course we can .
and earning a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher for example higher than the <unk> of americans .
we &apos;re going to try it . it &apos;s probably all wrong .
<unk> immediately goes off . &quot;
<unk> was trying to prove it , but he could never prove it .
i want to argue that this is simply not acceptable .
china wants to have reached over 20 years .
we don &apos;t even even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yeah , it &apos;s going to be , and yes , it &apos;s happening , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen -- and we &apos;re more than being able to overcome everything that &apos;s heading towards us .
and here come in the game .
and what we need to think is this : if you &apos;re dancing in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can pull this up on our children , but imagine .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what the cell &apos;s development is the cell .
it &apos;s not supposed to be amazing ?
everything we &apos;ve got is <unk> .
they will listen to you may be able to focus the sensitivity or <unk> , a series of things we can &apos;t .
that &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should outlaw these cheap , simple <unk> , and nobody can use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this .
we can &apos;t risk to the need of losing customers .
he has only got 500 and should have to get 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a giant jar of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come in a week when you get sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things that we &apos;re talking about -- is something less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the only thing that only 5,000 days .
so if we say the machine is that we &apos;re a <unk> , a human brain , a human brain , if we look at the rate that &apos;s growing , there are six billion <unk> <unk> .
now it &apos;s not like that -- if you do a chart and stuff at work , you &apos;re not part of the web but you &apos;re going to be it . you &apos;ll be part of the web .
i say , &quot; people will be the <unk> senses of the machine . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want .
the last thing i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
thirdly , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous . it &apos;s going to fill our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second <unk> was written by jesus christ , that it was the sun <unk> moon <unk> , and that i was prepared by god <unk> and prepared to his <unk> .
these are the dead from <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes all seem logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we line things .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just done in <unk> for a giant <unk> device that came out of this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that it &apos;s going to evolve .
and that led to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas work for education education .
and finally one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of them is about his neighbors .
so when we need to school school school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can impact our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may be a surprise , our gut has a <unk> brain .
and these <unk> is very , very important , very important .
we &apos;ve learned to talk about the big brain , flavor and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , someday we were all like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who can even have 250 stars in the sky sky .
of course , the <unk> monks was that i said .
the <unk> , the <unk> , where the sun is actually on , is actually a <unk> that constantly reflects the light on the sacred <unk> of machu picchu , the <unk> , called <unk> picchu .
if you pray for the dead , you make these hands of these gestures that they &apos;re up in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother is <unk> in the world , which is the mountains of the world &apos;s mountains , which is created the mountains of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of the human imagination .
this material that you &apos;re all familiar with is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s a little bit of toxic white stuff .
i put stuck in there , they fit into it , because in a hundred years , my body will come back to the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .

the other half of the audience may not be <unk> -- from deep , cultural reasons , they hold it for boring -- and find a different patterns much more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to a more secular <unk> , because they &apos;re dealing with uncertainty .
and only one percent is wrong .
he <unk> : &quot; i suppose that , after a sudden , death in a family will be the probability of one another . &quot;

the <unk> has saved hundreds of thousands of lives .
there &apos;s an intelligent <unk> injury because the power is always out , until a smart <unk> .
however , on the other side , china is a <unk> , a sense of <unk> <unk> .
you have facebook , we have <unk> .
yet , the <unk> itself can produce a very powerful force , which never existed in the history of china .
so , looking at the chinese <unk> than real medium , not just as mere .
like a great ted , not ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> is really changing , and they really did more transparent , because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
increasingly , more chinese will be able to see free of free speech and human rights as their <unk> privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s ninth symphony was a symphony symphony .

you can &apos;t be fooled .
i &apos;m very interested in both of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical argument for why technology is developed in <unk> ways .
now the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution used to essentially the technology of the technology of the technology to create the next stage , which is the first step in the technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world , so we can use a third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent per year , 28 growth in dollars .
another big revolution is <unk> .
so to our exponential growth of computing : 1,000 dollars of computing , for example , about the brain of an insect or a mouse or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to get the full of <unk> of these trends , and they need to celebrate them , how often the <unk> shape was made in the form of technology -- faster and faster , if we get at this point .
you can blessing and <unk> .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing here . well , it &apos;s not like there &apos;s nothing .

let &apos;s play a <unk> and see what happens .
this is the universe by stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to fall into this big adventure to fall into this big adventure , right in my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s next year is a <unk> in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of the presentation to convince you that they are the entrepreneurs that are entrepreneurs in which they invest and make a lot of money .
and next to the experience of being a business or something -- it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there &apos;s no shortage of environmental trials that have no problems in which there were no problems .
from there , you take them with -- on a solid solid , good path up . right from the end .
if i know about somebody who &apos;s making this device .
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition is working after the competition .
it was hopefully positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my ideas , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> , very <unk> presentation . that &apos;s great to <unk> , who are they &apos;re and about emotional .
i didn &apos;t know that this is pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a bug .
if you trigger something , you can maybe have an impact .
and if you have enough , you can click another link to another .
we &apos;re at the end of the chart , in the last place as the culture , which is not to estimate .
as we think and we behave , does our <unk> <unk> .
we have a <unk> meme -- seriously .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very strange .
our thinking is backwards .
through a <unk> change , like transparency , such as transparency , change , like <unk> , and collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are made things are being done , the only way for us to get rid of the old <unk> and new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can make bulgaria .
it &apos;s called <unk> , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the <unk> , because the <unk> was at the time .
after i had them with one hand aside , they were very -- i became very -- i became very -- and i worked for about six months .
nine days ago i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we made several magazines , doing our homework , but where we also looked , we were surrounded by pictures like this .
this is literally taken in seconds after the baby in the arms , and i was over the baby in the arms , and i brought it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t talk -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general belief is that every aspect of my life has gotten better is better , since i was born of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re in order to lose control of control in a wonderful way , what we think of our life is a lot of meaning , and what &apos;s exciting .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen this &quot; star &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine , big , you know , you know , big , you know , as you would play personally , john <unk> walker shows how video footage shows how images could roll on the exact <unk> and analyze it on the <unk> .
well , since we have a period of extraordinary economic growth , the longest recovery is in the history of this country .
but now , a couple of months later , as well , as well , as well , the apple apple sends always to bite , &quot; in the apple &apos;s apple bite without reading the face , &quot; how it does someone , you can &apos;t hide away .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a <unk> chaotic man who came from <unk> and iron <unk> .
but interestingly , does this also be a future that society has a few <unk> capitalism of capitalism , which is how you <unk> the dna <unk> innovation into society , by doing things , and then those who work work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to give you a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new findings that i &apos;ve been working on , about the relationship between the structure of the structure that you &apos;re talking about , and you want to save your tendency to save .
and if i want to talk to you right , it &apos;s forcing me to think about .
well , this is a <unk> theory .
if you squeeze this device so you can see this device with your <unk> hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important is the ability to communicate across generations .
we <unk> them all the time .
but i &apos;m about to use it as a pastor .
but they didn &apos;t have the results that they wanted .
at the same time i was in the field of <unk> , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> <unk> .
people and <unk> and <unk> and birds and birds , the red line here is high . these are people , livestock and pets .
we &apos;re focused on serious <unk> of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
it flew at the party last night , and -- you can see how it &apos;s just <unk> , and you can see every <unk> you want .
and he was a <unk> about how people who have heard of religion in india at the time .
and he goes back to the village as a <unk> man .
and he has got to his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and it &apos;s so disgusting and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we took us out . we take the feeling of a mother &apos;s memory and all these things in this meditation suit .
and you think about how <unk> things are when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re satisfied .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and <unk> .
even though the change is in your mindset for other creatures , you can feel that new quality in you , and it helps you , and it &apos;s helps them , and it serves them as a model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of mit , one of the society used to use one of the society to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very easy if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> , one example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop you on the bottom right , but in the bottom right corner , you &apos;ll see an example of what we have .
did you start to do that ?
and this is what happens to the things that you talked about jimmy talked about jimmy , which is our new way we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will be less to be able to get less , it &apos;s going to work in collaboration with the <unk> .
let &apos;s take astronomy , which is yochai mentioned .
it will also be <unk> to professional arguments .
so it &apos;s not going to be a <unk> of two <unk> , but between these things , all sorts of interesting positions that are taken from people .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to devote their <unk> to someone , and in fact , a team that was done : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him .
but the truth is that life is right here .
so people called the people in and have news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman <unk> to real true . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t have done before , so he turned out to another town that she had just moved into another city and a new job .
and over the last 35 years , i was studying human behavior based on the foundation of all sorts of genes , of dopamine , dopamine and things , up to the <unk> .
some of you have it , and it &apos;s about gender .
this was one of those cases , because there was no violence under their ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re so similar to each other .
by the way , i have an email tomorrow , in which we &apos;ve sampled the last part of nuclear atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that may be the least known .
so if you want to know why the sky blue is blue , or why nuclei together , they &apos;re supposed to be basically , with a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that you have now .
the comparison is that the people in this room are the higgs particles .
but it &apos;s really so that with the theory of the physical <unk> at the time of the big bang at the time of the big bang , an absolutely wonderful prediction . the model was not going to make it , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this beautiful image , the darkness in light , and it allows that to see the civilization of all of the space .
another big insight came from a study of <unk> state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the <unk> player out of <unk> years .
in a similar study , in germany , researchers are taking an <unk> to measure <unk> and after <unk> <unk> into the face of <unk> <unk> to smile .
&quot; because the colors you &apos;ve got , not the european standard , the european standard , he replied .
&quot; safer ? why ? have more policemen ? &quot;
we built the light <unk> that people , residents , residents of <unk> , trying to think they were killing when they were <unk> , they were <unk> for their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; i think you can do something and you did it . &quot;
in port-au-prince , entrepreneurs were creating entrepreneurs for cellphones .
an illustration of the technology is in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion characters in the world .
in the stores of the environment , <unk> , batteries and bread <unk> .
this is the <unk> of the time in everything that is embedded in the erosion of a <unk> , in the <unk> , the rose <unk> .
do you read an interview with a writer ?
and also , when i look at the big bears , i remember how i see myself as a kid on his head , to <unk> his head , and i feel again like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen seen how creative technology can be and in our lives and our lives , we can innovations the solutions , innovations and moments choose the flow of the time .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee camp , they had to <unk> soldiers that my elders brother mark mark mark , and they wanted to take a child soldier .
and i should do it by doing it .
take something you want , from the suitcase .
and then i ended up in <unk> , because i don &apos;t mean my feelings .
thank you .
almost all life on earth is about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should it be ?
so , in theory , we can grow each organ out of some cell .
here &apos;s the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if you can rotate at the same speed with the same speed , the robot is the robot .
and you see how robust control is .
and he does that while he smells obstacles .
you take your neighbors right .
this is what we double shows that we double double <unk> , we can make them more , we can form teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can be able to figure out where he wants .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much so much , and i want to expand your horizon , consciousness open and your view of honeybees .
so this has been a huge problem for many years , in the principle of the late &apos; 80s , the late &apos; 80s , which is the late &apos; 80s , bacteria and <unk> <unk> .
they don &apos;t .
they take the chefs for their dishes , and the honey -- there are <unk> -- they use the honey on your bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are going to die if they stick it , so they didn &apos;t want it .
okay , now , is the question : why is this ?
so , of course , we &apos;ve done it , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before it was so many people in this fact .
in fact , not many of you don &apos;t know that our bread , of course , is not central invention .
and in fact , it &apos;s meat in the <unk> and china is catching up the <unk> .
<unk> has been <unk> for most people , and there are not a lot of farmers among them that call them bad , bad to the environment that destroy the environment .
all right together .
and while i finished here , my bread is done -- and i &apos;m <unk> . and i &apos;m trying to get rid of my hands .
and also , it has to be a long time to think about the land with the existing tools , materials and <unk> <unk> .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyzed it and testing a new technology , and determines a new technology , and determines the quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago .
and what do we do ? what &apos;s our answer ?
this is about last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and jack <unk> , a film about her , <unk> queen , who should see you .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is now <unk> than <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient who was at the time at the time -- it needed to be a bypass bypass , decided , but for this .
i like this slide because you talk about it , what people really motivated to change , and what &apos;s not .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans are eating more fat because the one , and even more carbs , so the percentage lower , but the actual number higher , and the actual number higher , the goal is both .
one of the <unk> <unk> studies found out that 70 percent of the people were diagnosed , 65 percent of people had bad breath for bad breath -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , it &apos;s all about the intimacy , which is <unk> .
i hope it doesn &apos;t depend .
the film is based on a <unk> by f. scott
two <unk> were involved in this project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to do the <unk> and technology technology .
so we <unk> ourselves from motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinite .
and these are the data that we get from , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and this is what the finished picture was used in the film .
this was a very , very early rehearsal rehearsal .
and we found this , in the state of karnataka .
and it has its own <unk> .
the people of <unk> are these terrible , <unk> past that they lived for their lives .
we were too <unk> -- two of them as a driver -- and imagine it , it &apos;s a big ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think the camel &apos;s best <unk> animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so let me show you another film .
i don &apos;t <unk> until my body temperature 40 degrees celsius -- enough to <unk> an egg .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
let &apos;s start a meeting with a poem . this is an idea .
but what would you like to do if you never knew how to do the next day , if you &apos;re a living god , god <unk> the world , her shoulders in the clouds , or whether they sit down there , right ?
who could sleep at that night ?
but did you know that judy <unk> in your age for $ 150,000 dollars a film that was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> pascal -- no waiting , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end , she sat down in a tree and a <unk> one hand .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but if you remove these two columns , i wouldn &apos;t be much more left .
we also have the problem with elephants , that you can &apos;t build construction that too hard for an individual .
a component of this is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand the emotions of the other and share . &quot;
now , we explore more complex expressions . here &apos;s a little bit more complex .
it &apos;s not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple job that you have to do .
a philosopher wrote to us that it was impossible to make a sense of fairness , because it was <unk> in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely kooks ; it &apos;s not two crazy , three , three and a lot of power news .
so the last decade i spent that , pain and serenity , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i stopped in a way it was a success .
over the years , this is serious <unk> .
a.j. jacobs : how to make the healthy life .
and i think there &apos;s a lot of <unk> this view .
a really cool thing .
now , these studies scientifically <unk> , and they were <unk> , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not telling .
... a priest ?
and lastly , a group of which believes is that the indus people are the ancestors of people in the world today .
on the left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to produce more useful data that are <unk> .
so this sign is the number of the indus script , and it &apos;s just in this text .
it turns out that there is a long tradition in india to give names on the basis of <unk> at the time of birth .
space , we all know how it looks .
this wire <unk> the <unk> that made the name bell famous famous .
jansky had made the historical discovery that could be able to make things like <unk> the same way .
actually , all the young people in the city .
somebody sitting in the seat beside you -- that &apos;s okay , in a <unk> , you would be on a <unk> , and someone would be so close to you , then they would sit so close .
the dalai lama always says -- he says , &quot; he says , if you &apos;re in his mind , the idea of the <unk> comes out , it &apos;s because you can see that you and his pain will end up with a little playground for your own intelligence .
take this wonderful thing , the <unk> showed us , and they &apos;re scared of a fear of <unk> .
a man in front of a tank became an image that was a symbol for the entire world .
but what if you had modern communications , if you had modern communications , to create a sense that was wrong , that &apos;s where you went to something about it ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate the ability to communicate and to organize globally with the challenges that are largely global .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photo of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of the children &apos;s museum <unk> of life that were left , as in the <unk> of rwanda , a million people died .
here &apos;s the challenge : to help me build a vibrant , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
you can move around very different <unk> -- they vary into the <unk> , the motion of the surface and the <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
boy : <unk> .
we slow down to see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky , one of my partner , is an extraordinary engineer , an extraordinary engineer that developed a technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> , where it could roll the claws in an artificial foot .
they look like aliens , and the secret to what they &apos;re doing is their <unk> toes .
here we go through the band-aid .
these <unk> structures allow the spines , <unk> and the <unk> , <unk> , very difficult surfaces .
so <unk> <unk> long beautiful songs than a <unk> serve and males as females allow each other to each other and a mate .
so if we &apos;re less than 20 feet away than 20 feet away , they need less than half the time .
when we think of marine marine animals as dolphins , we need to tell ourselves about the consequences of our interventions in the clear of our interventions that we &apos;re right .
after the <unk> , the navy has done these systems to learn to experience these systems to learn what the scientists could hear .
they &apos;re just hearing low frequencies .
and if males and females use this signal to a mate to find a mate and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what effects that would have been on the <unk> species .
so how ships <unk> can be done . they found that with a better <unk> <unk> of this noise to 90 percent .
they <unk> the speed for 50 percent .
we see strangers worlds , we see <unk> <unk> , 300 times , and they &apos;re getting more and more . and they &apos;re not like we .
you have all options available .
we see a continuous rise of men .
and obviously , there &apos;s a hundred .
using initiatives like the $ 100 laptop , <unk> it reminds me of the idea that we have a whole new generation of people into the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think nothing about it .
our daily lives is , but in an extraordinary condition , they said in a extraordinary state , we say in a <unk> .
it &apos;s usually one or two per year .
and there it is .
but we &apos;re much more .
a part of the challenge was to try and rhythm to <unk> rhythm and space by not just my hands -- juggling is a lot of <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they all don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
you have a guy here up here , who &apos;s principle to do this whole life , ok ?
<unk> -- and then it comes to calm , just a little number over time .
in space , in other room , in the room in the room .
and then <unk> levels .
in this year -- if you &apos;re going to show you the slides -- in this year , we &apos;re going to take the <unk> with us -- in this year , a project where we have helped design design .
and we can call this on a <unk> , which is a allowed to make more information about the clothing , while you &apos;re these <unk> .
scott adams : i have noticed that i &apos;m going to become an expert on the way i &apos;m going to be in <unk> expert .
and we &apos;re going to also be a new product tonight . it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s going to be .
now , the farmers can only be just in the rainy season , and not in the <unk> harvest .
electrons go in a kind of <unk> and then just energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought was what he was .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . they did that ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the point behind this , <unk> ?
we &apos;ve been <unk> about four years .
if google gets a book , you put it into a very nice format .
i give you an example .
suddenly , in the 40s , everyone was excited .
but imagine that there &apos;s no no interest .
but also a lot of the right thing that apparently apparently has benefited from propaganda .
if you dig the <unk> <unk> , it means &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if i &apos;m going to run this beautiful sound for longer than a few minutes , you would literally stop hearing .
so a lot of people have come to <unk> , but this creates big , public spaces like these , shared <unk> , in millions of tiny personal <unk> .
you can also do this in a nice place , like a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you for here , you &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they didn &apos;t look at us on the <unk> and couldn &apos;t see the exchange that between me and my <unk> , a exchange for us , but strangers .
well , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the <unk> , there &apos;s a lot competition , because the arab spring is still still out , the <unk> is <unk> -- what else is ?
this is actually a photograph , even in a police row , and on the floor you see the <unk> of the people who were tracked by police .
the kids make just photographs in a class , the teachers , they put them to the <unk> .
so in this talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there is a <unk> .
this is something we can work in our lifetimes , and i thought i can <unk> a difference , and i tried to get out of the <unk> into the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some other traits that really really interesting .
what do we get more data ?
there &apos;s something we think it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s obvious .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we &apos;re looking for the alligator to not as very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we have evolved the <unk> part of the <unk> part of the <unk> portion of the neocortex . nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not so that you go and say , &quot; what am i see ?
not like a <unk> . not in the way a <unk> .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need a little police , we need some military , but just to defense .
you can see it on her . &quot;
they traveled because she was in elections outside the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when she opened the door , she said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no , no .
they wash this .
this group uses three , everybody .
it &apos;s real .
she has learned english , and this as a foreign language .
the computer was already , in one of three people .
if you think about that , they think unlike the company of the united states that were actually part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
and we ended up doing this experiment with the same groups , but also a delay between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price for this is the <unk> of paradise .
and they were moving and rubbing each other and they left their arms to each other and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at the ability to talk about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at the character .
then imagine a personal coach that <unk> <unk> like <unk> versus bad breath .
i feel about emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to meet in the minds of other people and figure out what they offer .
they have <unk> humility .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking for .
we found them between <unk> , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey ?
and it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
so what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : this process dictionaries dictionaries .
well , first of all , i admit to the queen , because it &apos;s funny .
dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- see when somebody thinks in a place , and it &apos;s not on the map , he thinks , &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , when we think that words are tools that are tools that we use to make our thought to make our thoughts better than hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different <unk> of definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there mike <unk> : mike <unk> lives in britain .
i have the whole time called the dictionary that the dictionary said .
so i get a chair .
and to make a long story short , i &apos;ve got here .
and so it &apos;s a piece of play , as this three days , you start to understand : why am i going to hear all this stuff ?
you may have come from a ted speaker , and we can take the conversation over the year , and next year , according to the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturer didn &apos;t have the <unk> into their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public was going to be so precise <unk> that could actually localize fold on the street .
you know , you know , if it was <unk> , if it was <unk> , it was technically not able to find the space .
instead of <unk> , you &apos;re going to do it .
and , &quot; you can trust . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> &amp; amp ; and <unk> and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a human <unk> .
we debate about what the world needs now is nuclear , &quot; right ? right ?
and up to now , there &apos;s only three <unk> of it -- coal and gas , <unk> , <unk> nearly all -- and nuclear is nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> into electricity .
now , <unk> emissions are equivalent emissions emissions emissions , and particles that cause warming , and it turned into co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear nuclear nuclear weapons is what nuclear nuclear weapons is about , because we know that india and pakistan <unk> nuclear nuclear weapons have developed in <unk> .
for wind , the land is much larger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support support of both parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to the global warming , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get out of renewable sources .
i used to worry about 10,000 years old .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was <unk> by apollo .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of a few people , some people , and the available technology that will allow us to allow us to the space of the space .
26 groups of seven countries took the competition in part , every one had between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage for the sponsor is the sum of the <unk> and social <unk> .
would you be surprised to us ?
that means that surfaces can cut itself . they can be incredibly small .
so a challenge was going to order to express this new illusion in a column .
and what i didn &apos;t know at the time we saw the outside , because we had seen the outside <unk> on the surface , within the column , which was quite surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of discovery , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible ones with millions of spaces . no person could create it by hand , but you can &apos;t build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this image -- lots of forms dancing here for them .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip <unk> even <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s run by young people .
and i think there &apos;s a lot of people here in the room , many of them are in the same position .
so i think women in our society will become leaders because they recognize it for their future generations , our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve been recognized that since recently and social networks , to give their stories and social networks to show their stories and their own voices with their own voices .
at the same time , we invite them to go and get our part of the world .
so i got more or less than &quot; nothing .
so i thought , &quot; well , if i make these ants a couple of homes , they pull them up there . &quot;
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i went back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , <unk> , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i took it around , and shaped the <unk> .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very high-risk job , but the best things come in little <unk> .
they &apos;re expecting their employees to do what they asked them , if they &apos;ve done the job , you can do more extra .
there &apos;s all this absolute concentration of consciousness , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that the primary properties of the subject is defined .
my <unk> body was flying into the direction , my <unk> wheel .
i made all of the walks of all the time i &apos;m probably not going to make them with them , the <unk> that i would not look at you , the friends i didn &apos;t want to look at that .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you <unk> them from the back of the back , you can just drag them down , and it &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors would cut off my leg and hoping , and there was one 15 percent chance .
as i got more and more of the human being -- and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 lbs .
and no one puts this modern <unk> in my eyes more than david black .
walking upright , says , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international facility for <unk> , which is the least <unk> name i ever heard .
he was born and a half months too early , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so as soon as i was trying to approach the piano , i became hard .
and at the end of the end , you were so quickly , things like the flight of the bumblebee , &quot; flight of the problem , right ?
do you want to play me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t <unk> this .
they fight their own lives in this forest , in this forest , in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that doesn &apos;t exist , in a world that &apos;s not <unk> .
so we know today that they &apos;re capable of doing the research that are totally impossible , when i started .
the very long loving family connection to the mother that was developed in this long childhood , and the siblings can maintain life , and that can be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it &apos;s also the giant <unk> of the <unk> woods in the forest , and so the pygmies that the pygmies that <unk> in the <unk> and there are so many hundreds of years ago .
yesterday , somebody said that .
we have now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than new york .
come on and <unk> me down here ?
there &apos;s the politicians outside ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty much the same thing , but with a few dozen of these different kinds of molecules -- such a <unk> reduction in the complexity , but it &apos;s trying to create something <unk> .
she &apos;s actually very <unk> . if you make yourself , you don &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all experts for these are the experts are going to play with these protocells .
so we &apos;ll see the self-assembly of these bodies of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black <unk> in this black mud at these black mud -- these <unk> , very complex , organic black .
in his lab , martin <unk> , &quot; the protocells , &quot; <unk> <unk> of the chemicals that are living like living cells . his work shows how living on earth should be done -- and maybe in other places .
this is a <unk> to take your tadpole for a walk .
what &apos;s that -- where did you know that ? you &apos;ve taken it .
but if we could do that in every fire hydrant , we could be able to redefine the <unk> .
so , soot is the filth , which is otherwise in her beautiful pink lungs , and it &apos;s connected to connect with .
the birds could jump from one another .
they can talk about him . you can talk to him with him .
but those flock will be a big toll of our planet .
next time we isolate the skin cells and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working on thousands of years with <unk> of products like wine , beer and beer .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re doing it in the world , we see that there &apos;s an universal pursuit of people who have to be a universal pursuit of people after that .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge amount of energy generating energy , mobile energy .
if we can see this <unk> future , the other thing you can see .
you had to survive .
and we should be safe to get to our school school district , and to get funding and support .
because why should we drive our students so far from their driving ?
it &apos;s got to a book , then .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west coast , they &apos;ve destroyed its forest .
but in this picture , you see how we started to build the <unk> <unk> , which is a big <unk> in brazil .
when i came out of time for me , my career was going to start , i was <unk> the new field of <unk> .
if you look at the south of <unk> , you can see the expansion of new york city as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are <unk> places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> places .
maybe there was a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so much force in it , science and visualizing each other is that these pictures come together , it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we have a really dramatic <unk> level of this society .
so i don &apos;t have to go into it .
you can see the <unk> , which of course .
this is a <unk> building .
an example that we all know is that the mobile phone . right ?
and it &apos;s about this question , of course , in a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts that help us .
seriously -- clap them -- this is really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future future
you could mean that it could be a big problem for a law , but it doesn &apos;t seem to make it very hard .
but if you &apos;re making a lot of money , you &apos;re making copies and sell a lot , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we have made of things that we &apos;ve found , and every single one is caused by the <unk> of this industry .
that &apos;s the easy thing .
i had a very <unk> , <unk> , expensive education in india , and it made me almost <unk> .
and i thought i was a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and persuasion .
when i said that , they said , &quot; what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
all the electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , as you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re an animal .
it &apos;s going to be a tension there , takes place to the schools , getting it between teachers and parents , and parents can call the <unk> of the teachers and the parents and say , &quot; give your hands .
you use sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mister president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> are creating one of the largest , dynamically <unk> computer in the world for this kind of <unk> .
so you can see the <unk> along the <unk> , which we as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there is data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m physically physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally , &quot; i don &apos;t get a minute .
he <unk> his money , and of course , ray six months later the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used to be used by which i used to be used by being used by <unk> images .
we collected our materials out of the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were expecting two pictures , and they had two gorgeous <unk> , <unk> <unk> of them , and we said , &quot; what would you come ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> and saying , &quot; you know , we give a <unk> and we can do it in two different ways .
<unk> , the big car and the <unk> <unk> are beautiful .
voices : it goes into the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition doesn &apos;t come from the <unk> of <unk> , but then goes back in a time before we <unk> stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the sort of <unk> roof , you know .
and so we left my father , his <unk> , because i knew he would kill me , if i let them go . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy , about a blue uniform and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
i &apos;m really going to really want to ? because if i didn &apos;t make a <unk> style to me , to make sure -- enough metaphors for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret <unk> .
she says , &quot; ma , you need to look . &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old , old lady , damn time . &quot;
she &apos;s got up from the car . &quot;
i really scared .
so what is the social result ?
where can i go and who together ?
and if we have it , we &apos;re going to decide how many miles we &apos;re driving , in what we live and work .
smart at the time at the station station , and you can see exactly where your bus is just the way and when it comes , and you can buy it in real time .
i want to say that we &apos;re going to launch the wireless , <unk> , and i urge this network to open standards for everyone .
and they came here in the late &apos; 60s .
and for all of you who come with a mental illness in touch , you know , what can be a challenge for a challenge .
i said that i wanted to tell the <unk> to you , i wanted to share with you the three one &apos;s , and i wanted to leave them with a <unk> .
because they all were three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey rosey grier &apos;s just an authentic person , and it &apos;s about authenticity .
i ate <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in <unk> <unk> .
j it &apos;s so many that this has become a problem .
i thought it was weird to speculate about how it would be a competition that &apos;s so <unk> .
it &apos;s predominantly a white , rich <unk> , who was not the <unk> of the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a <unk> .
the people <unk> over two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a sense of the <unk> over the <unk> of the new yorker that i found very emotional .
because if you look at four platforms along the <unk> -- where a constant version of a <unk> is -- we knew that it had to be mobile to <unk> conditions and changing the future of ground zero from ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that children suffer every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody forbid of us here and a concussion <unk> , that most of us , most of us in a period of a period of several hours to a couple of weeks .
they need to know about problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom was a good opportunity a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to preserve a 100,000 <unk> .
this is not true , but it happened to be tony blair in 2005 , as his <unk> , of course , &quot; discovered , &quot; and it &apos;s been described .
in other words , they have a shared complexity and growing complexity of visual language in a <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to <unk> patents for the last 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the drug company , their patents to make their patents and make them available for others .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> , the people sitting in the <unk> sun , the afternoon at very high feet , and they didn &apos;t think about it .
you can adjust everything to your well-being .
he offers all these services , <unk> , and so little things that you &apos;re going to work on , but for people who are going to connect to the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you do that .
let &apos;s see what he does .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick through the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
well , <unk> had a <unk> on our studies .
well , if we feel emotion , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people have a different structural position within the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both of the carbon , and yet , one of them has a <unk> in which they &apos;re put in a special way , on the left , and you get <unk> , the soft and dark .
so to <unk> this thing , let me pull out .
older people are not going to get older .
under the same conditions , older people are <unk> their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more on positive information than in the negative information .
we cost life .
and they would let me wish , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to get this <unk> for this girl in this bar .
kid david : it &apos;s so i said , honestly , often don &apos;t know exactly what happens when i &apos;m dancing .
they &apos;ve got me brother and uncles , and over the course of five years , i always invited back again .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort laramie has been given the independent of the big sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota &apos;s black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie was at least three quarters of the <unk> <unk> to the land of land .
they were suffering .
the <unk> is eight times as high as the u.s. average .
so what ?
and today , the child mortality has declined for 24 percent per year .
you can either get it as a pill or a syringe . you have to take it every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we like to do it , like here .
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s called : are you smarter than a <unk> ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is this car looks safe .
now they &apos;re thinking , &quot; if my life depended on it , i would use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something else to do an effective campaign campaign .
what &apos;s new is .
the lights will be dark .
we do it for our clients .
we have the inside of the sun .
now , the logic of logic -- logical looking , logically you &apos;re looking from this position into the here -- without the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . now , if each time -- another person -- not always the same answers .
so if you &apos;re interested in that , i &apos;m going to present a couple of <unk> .
here -- i &apos;ve got to look at the beginning of looking for me to be able to follow my spare cards while -- oh , we should have -- no problem , no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what &apos;s going to map me ? the queen or the five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
right moment , take any card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here &apos;s -- all of these maps are covered -- all the cards are covered -- right ?
and finally , the king -- five seconds .
some of them seem to know this child .
after i was back , i did my whole company to make my whole company . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have any musical ear , you couldn &apos;t turn it in the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .

imagine the person before , and they follow the same away from b , and you &apos;re going to hear everything about what &apos;s going on .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , has been conductor for 20 years , and suddenly a knowledge of knowledge .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old . her brother was eight to her parents lost them .
so ladies and gentlemen , and gentlemen , look at this one .
if you &apos;re all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks of the 21st century , this <unk> doesn &apos;t work -- often not , often , not yet , and often damage .
think about your own work .
the standard standard is low .
these are the building blocks of an entirely new <unk> for our business .
this one day of intense autonomy has led to a whole series of <unk> , who would never have existed .
do it because you like it .
it &apos;s going to be very easy for its easy weight .
and in a series of 55 balls , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , every sphere , where the distances are proportionate to this small planet .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows the other .
this has been developed in many <unk> .
this is the object in the object , probably a <unk> image of the earth .
but she leaves the 10 percent or more , most of the <unk> or more <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a <unk> <unk> dollars .

as a filmmaker , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future , and we think about what steps we could do .
there are 98 percent of nations worldwide .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that &apos;s really joy .
they think about whether they &apos;re going to move forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have any transition , we &apos;d have to invent this whole community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and to a certain extent , <unk> exactly the games that they &apos;re going to play to their own , and the topic that you can &apos;t see what are the right obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse and worse , and really just four states that are great challenge .
and even if you could just get that way , they could spend any of them .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and i was on a <unk> of my life in my life , and i was trying to decide between music and medicine and medicine .

let me start like this point .
it &apos;s getting more powerful storms and more flooding .
if yes , there will be an warming in the future .
but the <unk> is exactly the expectation .
the economic effects are almost inconceivable .
a big part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now , if a car accident , it &apos;s imperative that we &apos;re not just getting rid of the men , but also the crew .
so something used to be used for something used to be used to be used .
but today we use a <unk> .
more it &apos;s not .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> of the united states was making something quite incredible .
one of the difficulty at that altitude , if you &apos;re at 10,000 feet -- it &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 , you can actually use oxygen .

it was the most exciting thing that everybody love their love and their interest in the oceans .
as you can see here , this is a <unk> <unk> .
you don &apos;t hear something every day .
<unk> <unk> .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the <unk> who sit in prison .
she told him , and he <unk> the first <unk> in terms of what we call the <unk> .
because it doesn &apos;t get a <unk> .
so why don &apos;t we do something about this problem in our everyday ?
<unk> mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last <unk> ?
never , that &apos;s impossible . no , no , no . it &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could deal with this whole thing .
von neumann , a <unk> and a mathematician of the army took everything together , and then they needed a space to build them . they took a space to build them .
and the <unk> worked at first worked by <unk> .
&quot; aha ! &quot; finally found it was a <unk> .
i know if i can beat me . &quot;
he made the machine all night , if somebody remembers stephen wolfram reminds you of stephen wolfram reminds of this one .
now , after 50 years later here -- it &apos;s a sort of <unk> <unk> animation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about , four americans that i talk about here , four americans that are still alive .
this is a global problem .
<unk> city .
and he got the <unk> full of it . he &apos;s sorry to his friends , his family and his community .
you want to -- you want to control yourself .
you know , it &apos;s for long for long , long time in this particular idea .
we don &apos;t teach our children .
and most kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , don &apos;t play time .
in all america , a lot of wonderful things , if we just look back .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the net that connects everything , and will be very soon for most of human activity .
interestingly , oil uses its <unk> information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me how he was in 2003 and 2004 like he went in new york , took 10,000 dollars out of the atm here , 30,000 dollars from the atm that was used by the atm cards .
he was being born in <unk> in a stable and family class , his obsession with play his obsession .
and most of the ones , with the script and <unk> , they showed no real social skills in the world -- just in the web .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all determined by the market . and what the market is <unk> is particularly -- number one is the great demographic .
we &apos;ve found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that are transformed in all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and lots of libraries , like this one .
and finally , i &apos;m going to expect the streets of <unk> through the mall &apos;s mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped to make that eight of 13 local local <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the stream was <unk> by the parking lot .
their inhabitants are different than <unk> <unk> , but they &apos;re less <unk> than cities .
&quot; his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole <unk> . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t work there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
this is about gender , which is a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way it really is in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies of our bodies -- that this separation is created a division that often created the inspiration .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s a lot of work with happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s in my <unk> south carolina , which is not a much smaller than being done today , and even by a future as a british country .
well , maybe he was too <unk> because he was , after he was , after , after the following , went through the nazis , and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; put me the best workers that you can find them , and if they &apos;re good enough .
and equally , it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; i said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went alone . &quot;
as i said , he <unk> too much .
and you can right now .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re taking care of the most precious cases and order for the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went with , during the time of the soviet union .
and when you think it doesn &apos;t work anymore , it &apos;s imperative until you keep on .
so what i want to try to do with that -- i hope to prove this points .
and what i want to point later in the presentation is 50 percent of the u.s. in the u.s.
it &apos;s because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles , which is <unk> miles .
and so we went along with the <unk> in a field next to the <unk> , and they found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new <unk> of <unk> , with a <unk> that i replaced me , and i don &apos;t need to get into my own .
we find the <unk> <unk> .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s in seattle . ok .
but i would be a kid without <unk> control over my business system .
in some parts of the world , for instance , in south africa , education is very hard .
when we saw the impact of the <unk> , andrew decided , andrew , and i , we needed to offer so many people as possible education .
what was the special thing about this ?
the video is going to take a couple of minutes and join the students .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities of the humanities that multiple <unk> is not so bad .
in particular courses , you can ask questions that are the most <unk> <unk> and how to help students to fix this .
we actually see the beginning of either through a personalized <unk> or <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what was my first thought of what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , it &apos;s mainly mainly about making reality of others .
i &apos;ve heard that my doubt about the value of romantic science , such as rationality , it &apos;s expected to expect that you &apos;re rational .
so , you can understand my surprise when i was in &quot; the new yorker , &quot; the new yorker , was <unk> in the <unk> , said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i think you can do this kind of funny , and you don &apos;t have the ones that don &apos;t have , right , because of that reason , i don &apos;t know jokes about kenneth <unk> and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> right now that i &apos;ll tell you .
he said , i had to pay attention to it , because it can take more to 18 years , to become a really good <unk> .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid of this as an active person .
i was thinking about <unk> thought of the beauty that you heard yesterday , because he belongs to his book says that there can be some beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense council of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer in the world at the idea -- well , well , or very few astronomers astronomers -- that there are planets outside our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
it &apos;s constantly <unk> about an experiment with a particle accelerator and a <unk> that could be destroyed the world .
we need to do that with the biotechnology and the same <unk> .
so , we don &apos;t want to see .
so what can we do about it ?
and now the worst thing .
we spend a lot of money to make sure we &apos;re not going to die in a <unk> , but we don &apos;t give anything out . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get back to the wrong foot .
i hope that it will .
this is very , very important , because this is the system , the <unk> , which life came on on the planet , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing knowledge . and we &apos;ve only know about it .
and that &apos;s what the system <unk> , is a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
anybody who later comes to the database of the database , and the information that &apos;s needed , it &apos;s needed to everything .
we &apos;re about to <unk> the wave , the technological possibilities .
in the earthquake , large amounts of these new microbes that we never looked at before the sea floor .
so the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that our oceans for the global , interactive lab lab -- and this is a <unk> over the world of the deep court .
so i think that optimism architecture is going forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the process , you know , too often , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know , it &apos;s true that it &apos;s true ; it &apos;s the cathedrals that &apos;s always unexpected .
but i &apos;m going to play something completely , completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than the same time , so that it &apos;s from its <unk> .
risks in rooms that haven &apos;t been as <unk> as they should be in a <unk> town .
it &apos;s the emotions of the victim .
daniel <unk> builds very big ideas . he calls 17 terms of terms of the vision of the architecture that his vision of architecture is that -- raw , <unk> , radical -- and inspiration for every bold of bold creative goals .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the cars .
does something really , really , is going to be a few <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s just just . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and then <unk> <unk> on the roof , and then the <unk> on the roof , and then the <unk> is a monthly <unk> that is low than the <unk> .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve come in 2008 .
it &apos;s like <unk> .
how about everything in the world could be innovative ?
look at that .
boy , when you eat our livestock , and you can see a <unk> , like he eats one of our goats , is it very nervous .
we were hungry .
our tradition looks like this : in every <unk> there &apos;s a holy fire .
until now , we were dealing with the support of the world wildlife fund , the very small programs with <unk> .
it &apos;s also very important -- we invest the money in the enlightenment over aids and hiv .
<unk> -- again , a <unk> among many in the world of <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful agent .
and we hide the price behind the giant .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> lead a <unk> revolution .
<unk> , <unk> , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
it &apos;s like a <unk> of protein .
the science sees the world through the mind , and i think things can be measured and <unk> things , but they have the art of knowledge and knowledge .
from the plan of a few cameras , after three weeks , a plan for three weeks .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
it wouldn &apos;t usually be a <unk> photographer to <unk> a photo so that &apos;s right ? but sometimes it has to be able to show the dimensions of the dimensions .
here &apos;s how the glacier go back to the glacier .
these are several cameras .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just as it became a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
if we were talking to people in conversation with these <unk> , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
they can &apos;t be a professor , if they &apos;re not even a student .
the best hospitals for cancer would go into the doctors for cancer , and the <unk> , <unk> , heart disease , artificial <unk> , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a <unk> <unk> for four a.m. .
i said a <unk> message when i see one .
everyone in our society has come in touch with cancer -- if not personal , then through a beloved people , a member member , a friend , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we applied tumor fields in the lab at about 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect on all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in the sixth time , the tumor has responded to the tumor , and he starts <unk> .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new <unk> , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and it &apos;s a pipe pipe , and it &apos;s from her .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , soon it looks like this .
somewhere running a stream or a <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english , we have <unk> and <unk> .
and they still need to fall off .
these are the beautiful stairs that we saw on one of the images .
and <unk> are 27 percent reduction in size : 600,000 less people per year .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in getting the people out of the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to take them to industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries at the right , you see the <unk> , and the principle has every country with a <unk> , let &apos;s say less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> of saying we were three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india was not so right .
buy african products .
but i think that &apos;s a much bigger problem with it is that this logic -- that we get ipods and not bombs -- i mean it would be a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
and they have chosen 500 people and four of them were chosen to visit them , to visit them , and they were to <unk> , and then they <unk> it .
so now , in terms of planning by 2020 , we &apos;re not necessarily going to change anything , because it &apos;s still the dictators that control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : did the internet <unk> worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he slept with us younger .
because for me , who was <unk> in this period of time and in this <unk> question , the question was , &quot; do you want ? &quot; either sex or drugs we didn &apos;t .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and also politicians , i &apos;m quite concerned about the <unk> that our country , concerned , all the talk about india as new <unk> , even the new superpower .
in other words , all sorts of stories tell us all sorts of stories about countries , regardless of whether they come to the day or not .
but the lightning in our country at that time , quite slowly , it took about half an hour to get a call <unk> .
you can &apos;t understand the idea .
this can have statistical consequences . ok .
and those of you who &apos;ve been here , you may have be surprised to see how many <unk> on the <unk> are there that the <unk> will explain .
i went home and i was researching a little bit . i found some startling statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water .
and i feel like george bush .
well , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critics and this is a passage that i love , and i &apos;d like you to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be so , mother nature is a problem : how to get everything in the world , to mate chimpanzees ?
this is the hardest part of which is not obvious , and so i made it for the end of the end .
ok ? stop . this is going .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> <unk> , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i guess that probably probably the most obvious reasons you know , why do we know new things very , very quickly .
it <unk> look like this . you should see this .
bob mckim has another very -- another version of this practice made in a pretty famous experiment in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with the time , you know , you can do a much better , much more creative results when all the rules are .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , and i &apos;m going to come back .
you know , what it feels like , all of the uncertainty , as long as you spend in the corridor of the corridor , as long as you go in the corridor of a <unk> , and you wonder what &apos;s going on here .
so we would all feel secure and have a good time because we agreed about the rules , and it would be agreed .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re here , we believe that we &apos;ve done it . we want to go back and just listen to all that we succeed .
i was faster , but as depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is simply crowded . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully my god , &quot; hopefully , the last time .
he made sure everything .
it took 900 people in part .
and the second thing is that people seem to experience one thing .
these are questions .
as you can see in modern liberal democracies , the society allowed us to determine the state , the state of us not just to shape our own , but it also does it .
it means that we fulfill our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers of layers that i wanted to take you today -- the question : what are the intentions that are coming to the application , if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian <unk> us that there must be better .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;ll give you one in the fall .
he put them in the right position , <unk> her nose with his nose .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be a kind of <unk> to make the <unk> amount of power and speed the speed of the system that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load cell measures , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> load cell with a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and it &apos;s going to get <unk> and the load cell .
a very , very appropriate solution for the problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classic <unk> ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> , who just benefit from this three-dimensional space .
now you can see this -- he just let me face .
the submersible that was out last year is this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , and forgive the obvious example -- is not the right thing we need to vote .
basically , new york has been built on the back of the <unk> , our streets via their shells .
in these eight <unk> , they &apos;re little <unk> that will be <unk> .
so you walked in london , and i was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally created a map of the outbreak .
and this happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of the amazon in the amazon , d.c.
the other side of the field is <unk> <unk> where to actually osama bin laden &apos;s supposed to stop . this is <unk> .
this was one of the great <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me continue to show you the hubble <unk> of deep field .
but then you go to jupiter and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part of the beginning of the universe .
we just have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that &apos;s white in the image is dark matter .
when you saw that image for the first time , you haven &apos;t seen a lot of it .
this simulation has been done with 1,000 processors for a month just to make this visible .
so with a <unk> , we hope we have a resolution that &apos;s about this image of the earth that you can actually recognize the complicated patterns of earth .
and in the aftermath of course , we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we do this all the time , even in the day .
i went into a vicious cycle . that led to a lot of pain and problems with the joints that i could almost give anything more .
so i asked myself , could be creative , if you look at what &apos;s looking for ?
this whole didn &apos;t happen to tomorrow .
the <unk> is <unk> , as well as a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> police <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , who killed millions of <unk> . in the &apos; 40s , they were watched the nazis for the nazis , the nazis , the <unk> . many of the women were turned back at germany .
this is the <unk> . &quot;
and as a filmmaker , i got the idea most of us in the virtual world that we had learned in the virtual world that we had learned about our identity to live a better life in the real world .
we used to be a new way of being alone .
human relationships are selfish , messy and <unk> .
it <unk> them .
because in the moment where people are alone , even for a couple of seconds , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re going to make a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any one with the <unk> won that some of our students had predicted , and quite often -- -- quite often , i felt that they had made their predictions on the financial way .
maybe because of my father &apos;s always read .
so i took them to calm it down , but it &apos;s got <unk> and <unk> .
after all , i was thinking of a pyramid , but i &apos;m not going to take the time into it .
even though you &apos;re losing , not fear of failure , if we &apos;ve given everything we &apos;ve given , because who can give people more desire than anything .
if i want to call the name , i don &apos;t know an answer .
i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used for heart disease .
first of the last month , we &apos;ve managed to be able to show the creation of human <unk> .
and we can map them to map 360 degrees , and so on the kidney 360 properties , then we can just take this information into all of these parts .
i couldn &apos;t stop to school . just just dirty .
i was a kid , i was a kid , like , &quot; yes , i want this operation . i want this operation .
you might notice that is a new area called <unk> .
and connected with these <unk> , there were examples around the world -- from the election of a president to <unk> wikipedia and everything in between -- the showed that the power of a lot could achieve .
third , <unk> , <unk> issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd ; i want the music that she plays .
my name joseph and i &apos;m a member in kenya .
we need to our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure infrastructure .
late at night , i went home with batteries and ice ice .
together , does somebody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country that &apos;s going to give up to the master &apos;s master and working in the work of working .
this can be a huge amount of money , but if the city can take a number of x volunteers for five hours to win , the <unk> of the city &apos;s work .
they have <unk> , charts and data .
so these are the 18 minutes that were going to be <unk> to me here , between two and <unk> people who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> mud .
the buildings here are several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re in political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i could be part of a technological revolution that would make this dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same time , as i did , i helped myself through their careers , <unk> franchise in nigeria .
at the time , <unk> normally , normally with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read every <unk> .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to make me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , to the different <unk> countries : u.k. u.k. , canada , canada , australia had had to have different <unk> of harry potter .
the average rate of life has been more since more than doubled than doubled , and it &apos;s growing over the speed of five hours a day .
another thing . do you want to get people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new machine is going to be a good news because once the androids are taking work , we don &apos;t have to do it , and that &apos;s what we call the <unk> and <unk> .
the societal challenges are due to those inequality .
the economic playbook is surprisingly clear , and surprisingly straightforward , particularly in short .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with <unk> technologies , embedded technologies , embedded in a <unk> society and supported inequality .
over the course of the years , i began to feel increasingly <unk> with this notion of god .
some have <unk> that we can only believe in a god that &apos;s our pain .
in the second hand , the line is &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking inside the god , by my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things i started studying was the history of the <unk> technology technology technology . &quot; technology technology . &quot;
we have no <unk> found that older than 40 years were , and the average age of these tribes and german peoples are 20 to 30 .
our bodies have been used to these new diet .
so these equality of energy and matter , the einstein has shown , and also the modern science system shows , entropy and information and matter and energy and matter and energy and all of energy and matter and energy and energy and all together .
so that &apos;s a robot that wants to work its own plug in order to get more electricity .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great development that has started billions of years ago , it &apos;s moving through us , and it moves on . and our choice is in the technology , is really much more powerful to us with this force that is much more powerful than we .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classrooms 30 to 40 students .
we cut all this down , and we found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had this -- as we said , &quot; you know what the hull is like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we were sitting on the table tables and have waited .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , especially for the adults who work at work that were really known as they started to have a toilet .
the teachers with whom we work -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
you &apos;ve been working on the book , and this is how this wonderful works .
and right now -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind you saw how children were teaching .
there &apos;s also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re in <unk> , but it &apos;s opening up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s got his wife .
he writes an email ; he &apos;ll give you any question you can answer every question .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace is the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a page that is thinking about the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one that &apos;s &quot; manual &quot; manual , &quot; did you know that ?
there &apos;s <unk> roads on the cape streets , and we all can drive here .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you .
he said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i &apos;ve always felt bad .
so i went to the kind of complications .
i found out that these are very good <unk> .
the university is most difficult , so it &apos;s number 10 .
in fact , in a strange <unk> , about <unk> , who &apos;s a window on a window to the moment that the street had been black <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> there was <unk> in the sun .
and i was struck by the great presentation of karen armstrong reminds that religion really understood nothing to believe , but with behavior .
the <unk> has to be geographically , geographically , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s got the same size as the united states , the <unk> of an area that &apos;s about the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the countries .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the australia , to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of <unk> that we own through the assumption .
so before i show you some images , i want to show you a beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
and the worst school is really an extraordinary school .
and we &apos;ve discussed this morning with keith <unk> that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful to their talks to show you as a <unk> <unk> .
so here you have examples that you can print it in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that lets you think about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge of us as a physicist , as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more , more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; <unk> 7 . &quot;
and there are some staff in foundations that &apos;s called this <unk> .
the idea of justice , which affects our life boundaries , and gives us a sense of what &apos;s right in life , which is just what we should do , social justice .
and like that , he <unk> it during the <unk> .
so every week would come to the <unk> . &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or an operation .
the muscles were <unk> , paralyzed -- <unk> call <unk> .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- that , frankly , in this kind of pain of pain .
now , you get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . nothing . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back rows of the back rows . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called &quot; deep impact , &quot; which is one -- which is a part of the nucleus in the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts like , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a <unk> and vote , and we can change our future .
and at that time i was <unk> , the only independent independent , just to be precise , the only electronic medium in the country .
and i thought that <unk> was going to survive and a great business company , if it was going to be gone .
and at the end of the meeting he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you will never see your money , but my foundation will get 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s okay , let &apos;s meet your business business , what they actually did .
look at us , we &apos;ve started working with our work , and we &apos;ve started to russia with our work .
after a time we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve created the idea , going to spend on the open press , <unk> .
and in that way , you &apos;re in the funding , you know that there &apos;s no <unk> , no blind to find themselves .
so , why does this happen ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some call it &apos;s a theory of everything .
one simple example is this : newton , the law of gravity , that works like one divided by the square of the <unk> between the one of the other <unk> objects .
the more you &apos;ve got more symmetry , the way you think is the simplicity and elegance .
one thing that he was thinking about today , most of us today , but at his time , this was not for granted .
it doesn &apos;t <unk> the meaning of this thing to know that they follow <unk> laws , and accidents .
but he read it in every time he had , books .
by this ambition , he went back to <unk> .
but when he was just about to put his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf , because he was deaf , because he was a thousand hands during the morning .
not surprisingly , there were only three women under the 16 house <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand , the more i understand what was incredible privilege of a man with this aging lion of a man .
and the way lincoln was telling the story was all the after the war .
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
and what &apos;s the reason that i &apos;m always grateful is that i &apos;m always grateful for these strange love to be love to live in back to the past .
he had <unk> the temple and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the proof of the proof that the jews moved into babylon , after all the years that they were sitting in babylon , and at the memory of jerusalem , that would be the <unk> home .
all these are being respected by cyrus .
the <unk> cylinder is inspired by the priests of the great <unk> by <unk> , marduk .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of us in iran are jewish in the jews .
some more people know more about the lives of life , but they &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re a <unk> .
the newly <unk> babies cried for the first few hours , but their needs didn &apos;t come home and eventually they learned themselves , and eventually they were <unk> in the air , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
one study shows that 10 percent of a cost cost to 10 percent of a cost , whereas <unk> about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost my whole life on a camera .
you know , you know quite quickly what you have to do .
it was <unk> people -- most of them are friends and family .
we heard each one .
but of course he came . it never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it managed to bring out of course .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in the peace and all of them , etc . , etc . -- and they got a lot .
we connect with <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; in london , 2012 .
it &apos;s about their <unk> to do their business .
the biggest majority of the world should be the cognitively possible .
i <unk> the literature on the origin of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , this is exactly what our ancestors might have invented a 1.5 million years ago when they discovered it .
rather simple opportunities for the <unk> conversations that i did .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but as soon as the fighting was <unk> , the physical rehabilitation .
behind him was a child , his son , his son , in a face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
the evening i spoke to my bosses in the headquarters and i told them -- i <unk> -- i <unk> them , &quot; look , we &apos;ll start with a couple of hours every day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of <unk> started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not just in the orthopedic center , but it &apos;s also in the houses of people .
and you should see me as a <unk> .
and this hospital could have been able to afford .
why ? because the way i took , i was banned .
but i learned something more than that , which is that the leader of the economy -- the manager of the economy -- incredibly bad decisions that had made our economy .
because i knew the state of the african continent for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had at swarthmore .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment where a great society can rise within one generation .
you know , it &apos;s a <unk> yellow ball -- the sun &apos;s yellow ball -- the sun &apos;s the sun .
in fact , this is something that half of them , more than half , is not going to be familiar .
32 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . &quot;
and these are the messages that you are ?
because , in the end , the sponsors love love , and this is how he puts them on tv .
a professional <unk> who speaks to dead , they won &apos;t reach me ?
what &apos;s <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to make suggestions of you how to <unk> , <unk> and <unk> community , to put them something .
thank you .
and that &apos;s why the entire hospital is often just a <unk> generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but you can control the user control , whether it &apos;s electricity or not , because you can control the <unk> on the ground , how much percentage of you are .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can put in hospitals .
the different kinds of writing in africa , the first one was <unk> , like the typeface <unk> shows how the <unk> of a secret society is in <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , when a <unk> named john <unk> was <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , centuries ago , centuries ago .
almost a fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions is from <unk> -- that &apos;s more than from traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the animal , to <unk> and animals on the assembly line , like tools to make tools like tools , isn &apos;t it .
<unk> was a <unk> issue .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would mean that maybe maybe not so bad .
i asked about a year ago , &quot; why am i , although i know , although i know what i know is not a vegetarian ? &quot;
the weekend has choice .
you can do an image with an iphone and all the name , even though it does sometimes make mistakes .
it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;ll win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you &apos;d think it was interested in interest , more about it , if the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- an sunset or a big artwork .
the human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and this is the reason why we have a ethical level in which we have -- is that they are intrinsic .
it could be more complicated to people , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i knew the same thing i need to do .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of fluid .
and so i think that they can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio studio .
we take the pizza , our first , our very first pizza , and <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> in the hallway , and we &apos;re <unk> .
i was certainly 20 to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you to pick the work .
it &apos;s not photoshop work .
they were interested in creating a novel to create alternatives , and they needed money to create money , so they decided to do some interesting fundraising projects .
this project called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and did this , it was crushing the attention .
and she describes how the <unk> -- everything you &apos;re saying is because of <unk> fruit .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s related to origami . so .
people used mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles .
or you put it on the top and make 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that you put together , you &apos;re covered in the <unk> with the lines of the lines , the extra rules .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need something .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> <unk> in the state of washington with a lot of time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;ll talk about hours of hours .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , it will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph is -- it starts in 1973 in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> the market market , and it goes on to the day today .
you &apos;ve got instruction on top .
because i write about all the book i write , and i &apos;m still not an answer .
and that was very disheartening .
because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information yet , come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and some sort of <unk> species , where you can see .
there is no man or not a woman who is in the middle , and it &apos;s about the wires .
while the personal income was on a scale , which has been accepted to account for inflation , even more than doubled , almost tripled .
and to listen to me , to understand what i say , you know about 60 bits per second .
so , again , it &apos;s going to happen to me in the last book of myself called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed a bunch of ceos that are very successful and at the same time , very often <unk> , with great social sense .
control is always a safe thing , because you &apos;re in your mind , but not very much .
&quot; where are you born , grew to school ? &quot;
because my grandparents were born , they had their own significance of what &apos;s home . they had their meaning for community , and even for <unk> , which they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are in the future or present in the future , like the past .
i went down to the room i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world that we have today , no gap .
and let me show you why i think about the <unk> , digital technology .
that &apos;s where the children are the new green .
and again , they were better than we , &quot; your brits and your mortality in heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but if you have people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started to work with <unk> <unk> , and they were growing , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice that could not produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mom , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
if you could be good at the summer as well .
certainly many advances , many advances in life .
this is actually a real photograph , at the time , which shows that this is within less days .
and here on the right you see , what six months later is that technically <unk> .
a <unk> is two different types of types .
we put it back into this oven-like device .
even more complex organs are much more complex organs , and the most complex solid organs are the <unk> , with a lot of <unk> <unk> organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not <unk> and no tumors .
we need only five seconds .
for every problem , someone would have an idea .
so i &apos;m just a little bit of panic -- unlike all of the <unk> and sugar that i had -- but this is an entrepreneur for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you need to visit a <unk> .
i went from door to door and sold <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
it &apos;s useless . &quot; you need to find a way to find out faster .
i sold a lot of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the opportunity to find other tasks , and they learn the ability to find other tasks , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and bad you &apos;re going to show you how bad <unk> looks like .
these young , <unk> .
so the evolution of the world &apos;s students is , all the way out of the board .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> are <unk> by the most of our students .
the values of the past will be <unk> . that &apos;s a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we need to do is , if we think about conservatives , except this case of the 1980s -- what it is about : you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t believe me .
and it doesn &apos;t just lead to another result , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
in fact , it &apos;s not exactly the rights of the rights organization , but clear -- let me end up the end -- creative commons offers a simple way to the liberties for you .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often this happens .
he told me that he <unk> the <unk> and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going through this process and show you how this journey looks .
and the hospital and general , <unk> , was happy .
i survived that we really understand ourselves .
i &apos;m going to ask all of people , &quot; is it really possible to use this microbial ecosystems to use this microbial ecosystems ? &quot;
another way to how microbes spread out is through the people , architects , architects in the way , architects have to interact with the human interactions or the exchange of ideas in which labs and offices .
imagine a design that affects microbes , for example , on a plane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my companies , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to be the <unk> , and the way that you wanted to do that was in it , one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
at 78 percent of the voices of the voices , to give you an idea of the <unk> victory , which is done by two percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is , you can be pretty successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what was a big privilege to stand today before .
this is the school that built with the community .
something that we have in gando is <unk> .
just that .
good morning . magic is a brilliant way to be able to be able to be able to do this , which is to make the science tomorrow .
there &apos;s the color red and the color black , they &apos;re standing for the <unk> shift from day day .
voice : why not ? it &apos;s a very good slate .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not as a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t run a country like china , based on the basis of a civilization , a system system .
and the reason for this is , first , the state in china has a very special value -- a very special value than the <unk> , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was <unk> miles long to <unk> beijing and shanghai .
we have seen this in terms of the <unk> -- which is the position of the <unk> <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he goes down in tracks a street in <unk> , and the cars are driving .
red is <unk> blue = blue = <unk> orange , <unk> orange = <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second was in chinese .
she agreed .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , using the city as canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they &apos;ve all been accepted that their image next to another row .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a <unk> face -- that &apos;s a <unk> face , right ? &quot;
most places that i went , i decided to go to the media because i heard about them in the media .
i took more pictures and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you about the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were <unk> , <unk> a woman , &quot; now , god can see me . &quot;
because this is a big part . there &apos;s layers behind every photo .
but they &apos;ve got a promise to me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the mesh and what you &apos;re doing about what it is , i think , there are some of the factors that i want to give you as a <unk> .
they have a trend .
so zipcar started a decade in the year 2000 .
it challenges in participation . cities have been welcome to participation .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years , extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
this would be a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s vital to the ted ideas of ted ideas , ideas that we think about the front , and make sure that this is a particularly brilliant century , and not one of <unk> and <unk> .
my <unk> family are boring to the very boring and <unk> of <unk> for our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be crazy , but something really remained .
i was sitting , like you here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra , my career <unk> , i made it much success .
i started exploring the <unk> of the human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very honored to be here at ted in 2006 , in 2006 , in 2006 , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fall .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you remember ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents found this important for her inner silence .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s kind of stuff apart that i have <unk> <unk> .
the body has a higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and this is going to be very far .
i asked him what that means .
at that point , if you want to , several languages , several languages , and they &apos;re taking them without influence each other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s better . &quot;
i think they agree with me that they look very well .
and since we &apos;ve done tests with over 50,000 students , it was about to build a half a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found out -- and we were wrong with quite many things , and we did it -- but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a little introduction of <unk>
and ultimately , the only person , the next thing , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul saul and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men , and with <unk> .
goliath is light prey . he has no idea .
so goliath is about much larger than <unk> , and usually there &apos;s an explanation for that when someone is the norm .
and i think it &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out that we &apos;re covered in a <unk> , and these microbes are actually mostly good , rather than killing us .
they have all the microbes in the receiver , and they &apos;re used in the receiver .
most pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , or two , maybe five species , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands and thousands of species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what they do our lives .
so a lot of people think about the internet is about english , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . we have many , many languages .
when you saw it before you saw a ridiculous change on me , you &apos;d probably thought that all this was just a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we &apos;re not much much about truth and objectivity .
and we have over 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough for the beginning .
and i always like to say that she &apos;s the only person who &apos;s actually all of the rules of wikipedia that actually ...
it seems to me as though , as most of the textbooks that are used to education our children , from nature .
in the jungle in guatemala , there &apos;s a temple .
a little-known indian indians in <unk> told it was a sophomore in <unk> , and here is it .
it &apos;s very far under your cognitive <unk> .
we also found activity in the other <unk> -- in <unk> , which is associated with the computation of profit and loss .
i have a girlfriend that &apos;s just a terrible <unk> process .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other , and we think our appearance , &quot; and we &apos;re talking to each other .
tools like <unk> , knife , <unk> , or <unk> <unk> that i had in a towel .
i &apos;d been looking wide and wide looked for , but never in my proximity .
in some cases , they &apos;re tools , like sponges to <unk> .
so , dolphins can <unk> and take away from the distance .
look how to synchronize with their partners and the other <unk> .
but what we found fast is that free dolphins can &apos;t just hang on a boat with a keyboard .
this dolphin called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because she &apos;s about 12 <unk> <unk> .
but while we decode their natural sounds , we plan to do that back into the computer .
and the word is invented .
there is yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the <unk> , you have to fly it .
yr : i &apos;m just trying to be mentally .
i &apos;ve probably been using twice the last 15 years -- never with this kind of wings , but at the beginning .
that doesn &apos;t tell you your employer .
but it was <unk> and full of <unk> .
remember , what you saw , what you saw , was using invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution , since the knowledge of our knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adapt them to our needs to be <unk> in the way .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
it &apos;s <unk> ; our head on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a <unk> story .
and just if one explanation is good , it &apos;s also important you can check them .
<unk> are not very expensive . they &apos;re quite abundant .
it &apos;s currently used by 30,000 .
what is minto for a place ?
the new festival challenge the audience to the audience , a key role in the design of performance performance .
she had another , &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant , &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant , &quot; and it &apos;s done everything . &quot;
&quot; no <unk> , that &apos;s good . &quot; first doctor : &quot; is you <unk> ? &quot;
i thought my career was over .
this is a bear that i sat on the rock for a while .
this is a piece of <unk> ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
so i &apos;m going to show you today images of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and bears and bears and leopard , but this image here is that i &apos;ve ever done more .
people said the same thing , &quot; we know that they &apos;re cold . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took off the penguin head and she pulled it back and forth .
she swam away , starting a penguin .
she was trying to <unk> my camera <unk> , which is the dream of one .
paul <unk> : stories from a <unk> <unk>
open your eyes now .
have you also a ring ?
they &apos;re focusing on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing it for now long until it <unk> it .
funny , yes , we have a little man there , a <unk> , all the day up there .
as i said , what shapes you do .
first of all , we were working together with ushahidi and to develop ushahidi .
a call in the u.s. , in canada or china , five or china costs dollars .
she &apos;s built <unk> , so you can also catch a <unk> , and also in remote spaces .
at the time , the buildings were higher and bigger our technologies , so that the mechanical systems were enormous , and they need huge amounts of energy . they need huge amounts of energy .
imagine , two americans travel together in italy .
now , please take all the time as liberals .
the best definition of &quot; <unk> &apos; i know -- she explains so much -- come by <unk> gary marcus .
he lets us very , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines .
isn &apos;t it just the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
she went upward and keep on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws away from my body . &quot;
and we have the symbols of <unk> on the right , <unk> is the liberals god -- and both work together .
and so the answer , i think this is dedication to be dedication to the truth , and try to turn them into a better future for us .
but if you react , a lot of other people are living in the environment that are innocent , but also hurt -- the military doesn &apos;t want to talk about <unk> .
we look at something else , &quot; and didn &apos;t seem to realize that the situation were very comparable .
is someone a commandment of how many times when you consider how it was being done , how often the police spray o.c. o.c. spray at the time ?
there was just a few people who were shot at this incident .
it &apos;s 72 , and it looks like this is the most important way to deal with her .
and if you &apos;re willing to use them , people will give them , but they shouldn &apos;t cause any <unk> . &quot;
we &apos;ve started makers to organize makers from our maker .
<unk> , or billy <unk> , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved here to the other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we need to bring it into the schools , or in the communities , many ways -- the ability to construct the world around us and new forms .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these <unk> pictures of stars all the time -- you call them <unk> .
it &apos;s not about a way , but you have to imagine your world &apos;s mentally mentally .
so the <unk> winds are glamorous , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to be the illusion that if you buy this lamp that you buy in a world without wires .
the perfect <unk> -- <unk> through the perfect chain , with the perfect chain .
because of glamour can be very <unk> .
but i also knew how hard they worked for all week .
i was in front of the strangers .
i heard about women who were gestated in their beds , or <unk> , in their <unk> , like dead left in parking spaces that were burned in their tracks .
then i got cancer -- or i found out that i had cancer .
my girlfriend prepared this big bowl , and i asked her , &quot; what is that ? &quot;
it was <unk> friends and a loving sister .
because we all are so bad <unk> that will introduce us inside of our peers , and their secret intentions . &quot;
children need a long time , until the system .
rs : <unk> . -- now , joshua &apos;s coming to drink .
rs : should ivan get in trouble ?
and you &apos;re in the coffee of your girlfriend .
first of all , i &apos;m going to prove to you that it &apos;s a <unk> .
please tell me that they &apos;re not going to be <unk> , if , let &apos;s say , the pentagon is so <unk> .
but why do you have to feel something ?
and it was , you know , you know , a course of <unk> .
and second , is it possible , or even more <unk> ?
they want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark , and finland are under the six <unk> nations in the world and working hours where the average american woman was crying .
but the new idea , the revolutionary idea of the <unk> is that it &apos;s also something like &quot; good . &quot;
i found the <unk> <unk> like a <unk> task on my <unk> , and it was <unk> to me , because they were so slowly , and i quickly finished .
and so it took all the beginning , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on an island ; it &apos;s got to be a part of the bank , because we want to keep the community . &quot;
and i was working months and i didn &apos;t deal with it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum , already with the information full of the historical museum , if you see a museum with information , they wouldn &apos;t process .
when i flew back home , the <unk> was planned .
but you can see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe safdie .
and if christian played a note -- play for example .
so in jazz , the <unk> is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about my vision or something like this .
am i ? i exist for you ?
they had to get a lot to get here .
in the summer , india is extremely hot .
and the adult animal is that after , lives , one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it today . these are hundreds of <unk> .
so that made me a little bit curious about it . i listen to you , because i want you to ask , and there &apos;s a lot of people -- it &apos;s from course -- people who &apos;ve spent their childhood here .
so when i was next to the phone .
october , november , december . that &apos;s not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , they lay their eggs at the time of the <unk> rains , while the <unk> <unk> .
last week , it has <unk> , the <unk> have begun , and it &apos;s now <unk> .
a pretty incredible <unk> .
incredible . this is the <unk> of a <unk> at all . quite incredible .
i made this out of my life .
and everybody thought i &apos;d be good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , he &apos;s -- oh , it &apos;s -- oh , what &apos;s happened ? &quot;
at night i looked at them and i asked them , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
next -- oh , pay attention . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done it all , what &apos;s it is that you get rid of the <unk> and other things , but what drives one ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden is really the code .
whenever the norden bombsight turned into a plane , it &apos;s going to be a series of <unk> .
the chemical chemical <unk> across three square miles .

the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe is not to complexity from a <unk> .
so here we go .
what you see here is the blue areas are about one one-thousandth of <unk> than the red .
that &apos;s how gravity works over smaller periods of gravity , what explains why you and i &apos;m smaller than the stars and planets .
you &apos;ll be familiar with the <unk> of the dna .
let me explain why .
over the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good if it &apos;s about insurance .
and then they have to invest in their 52 choices , and they &apos;ve never heard about a <unk> .
at least a wonderful study has predicted .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you cross the box if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples to get two apples .
saving more tomorrow .
this is just an example .
it &apos;s a song about something called <unk> , a creature that is mimicking a creature , which is a creature .
hi , who is there , please ?
thank you .
this is how much impact on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did you do ? she sent her walter raleigh to her walter raleigh , to separate their human part of her .

elizabeth : <unk> you out ! throw out ! throw out !
i went to a friend of mine , and he made me wait in his <unk> hill in <unk> hill in the united states , a really rich place in mumbai .

and you &apos;ve got to look like nuts from the rainforests in order to show that forest is more than forests . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t <unk> a person who says it . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if you &apos;re all going to be sustainable planet , how can we do this ?
coke needs to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
we had , i think , 60 percent of global production production on the table , and 25 percent of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they &apos;re also buying the carbon in the trees , around the trees , around the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the product .
this is the communication of communication between the brain and spinal cord , which leads to a complete and sustained paralysis paralysis .
after a few years , we &apos;ve been able to develop a electrochemical <unk> , which is the nervous system of the spinal cord by a <unk> <unk> into a <unk> state .
we spent 10 years hard to get this goal .
after a couple of weeks , we &apos;re putting a programmable pump to the individual pump , to inject the individual <unk> into the spinal cord .
and i was a child of the class .
he talked about the world , as she &apos;s &quot; the world , &quot; and the world , like it . &quot;
and by doing that , <unk> , these women , many obstacles from the way .
in the white house , the desk he &apos;s sitting on it , is called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
on the last day , the woman who came across everything , and we were just talking about each other , and i suddenly told them , &quot; would you sing me ? &quot;
for example , this <unk> is a <unk> of the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely <unk> , and it &apos;s also beginning .
they didn &apos;t have everything .
so the internet takes <unk> and instructions .
one of the most most popular websites in the world that &apos;s run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing to youtube or google .
and today wikipedia is so <unk> that you can actually find them in the maps of restaurants in china .
and this is what wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk>
the world ended up not in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the environment is very , in some countries , very strong .
all this costs .
and it was a lot about students with <unk> or <unk> , the same opportunities .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in <unk> , the teachers are going alone in the classroom alone , and they have a lot of <unk> .
some people argue that the change of the <unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> .
but if you look at the problem from this perspective , you see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i walked across the whole morning about 15 miles to the <unk> .
so that was obviously a <unk> device .
we could do it with phones .
so a business for them .
&quot; the government needs to provide economic services . &quot;
it was once , a long ago , a long time ago when i was 24 years old , i studied at the time at john &apos;s s in bangalore .
and you can see my map when i &apos;m here .
and also , i &apos;m teaching an invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you can see that japan is through a time of war , with low lifespan .
and they decided to not just invest in health and education , but also also started to invest the economies .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble bubble .
are the once wealthy countries completely fully accept a fully altered global society , and the power power of where it has 100 to 100 years back to asia .
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called &quot; dark energy . &quot;
but that explains the presence of the whole crowd .
and let &apos;s give you the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on as a <unk> model .
they move apart from each other because the space gets bigger .
by looking at things like clusters of galaxies -- how many of them are there as a function of time -- we can put in the experience of the time -- we can put dark matter on which which is dark matter and dark energy .
the big question in physics .
sleepy guy banjo boys : <unk> <unk> of ... new jersey ?
so , recycling and recycling are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : 1.3 million reasons , <unk> <unk>
and in fact , there was this change in gay men in the u.s. during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adult africa and also a lot of children .
in uganda we see that the prevalence of the prevalence .
this is going to be pretty similar to close .
but openness and connection has a prize when we think about diseases . that &apos;s not a surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> studies in africa , from an economic perspective in africa from an astonishing conclusion : all of our knowledge about the spread of hiv is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this sort of <unk> italian <unk> <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , because it was <unk> in the tunnel , but every time he was going into a tunnel , he built a <unk> on the tunnel in the tunnel .
these hump work on the water like a magnet .
and then we ask ourselves , why is the membrane and why it takes so much power .
for example , in <unk> <unk> into a material .
<unk> <unk> , my <unk> , working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> together .
janine benyus : biomimicry .
&quot; yeah , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not , and luckily , no young boys .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it will never happen in india , because it was now , and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a <unk> for about 1,000 inmates in this prison prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we made a few years later , a kind of <unk> development .
in fact , you &apos;re doing it by a old book .
the number of pages are actually using the recaptcha , actually so high that the number of words that we digitize a day is very , very big .
some are more fun .
at the time , the web is <unk> in several languages .
then my <unk> is the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a flap .
but what &apos;s even more surprising is the translation of the <unk> , even if you &apos;re just <unk> , the translation that we &apos;re going to be like , as the professional <unk> , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people learn value value , they don &apos;t need to pay money with cash , they don &apos;t pay for them .
the <unk> page , the business , what they really can do .
<unk> to active participation is all other than normal .
and so zipcar offers a very <unk> , <unk> service , which is fantastic .
for aristotle , it was good to aristotle &apos;s goal to all the other .
maybe these people have right . his thoughts is <unk> , maybe not good .
ten percent of the time , the thought of ... -- sex .
i played the violent african africans , the african terrorists .
well , from the first time , i went out there &apos;s no explicit fan -- it had no no one &apos;s absolute majority -- so the elections in a second stage three weeks later .
now , here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i went to la jolla , and i learned how to go .
the people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how to think that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that &apos;s why we breathe that from a certain reason and so .
and so charles , i &apos;m going to make money to give you a building , and you can give you a building , and you can &apos;t talk to you about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought that everyone was a little bit of mind that would make it .
just to see what &apos;s going to happen when you mix the two .
so i have something else that &apos;s not personal .
if you want to be rich today , entrepreneurs will be entrepreneurs .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s not going up -- it &apos;s not going to go up at all . we &apos;re very careful about satellites , and it &apos;s been very careful .
biochemist mullis : <unk> mullis : the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and his own <unk> curiosity in the garden and <unk> curiosity in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a simple way of living the living body that these <unk> , decrepit spaces of occupied .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a nickname for new york and <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , which made out of the sense of <unk> in an urban environment .
i love it to travel , and berlin is one of my <unk> .
and the whole time , i haven &apos;t seen a single rat at some of these places , until recently , when i was in the <unk> of london .
the first question is , and maybe you &apos;re writing it up , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual leaf in your head , and to give you a virtual leaf in your head , and you can do that .
and we refuse to stop , &quot; we &apos;re the best <unk> college school , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- you know , you &apos;re nodding -- well , in your <unk> , you thought , &quot; hmm , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is when people have an idea of how it works , it &apos;s quite hard to change this .
and as an expert , i have friends and colleagues that are different between the organic , living world between the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , he <unk> , <unk> , grows in a way .
we actually have amazing life life that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a letter in a letter to a fellow who probably lives in a warm little pond somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe somewhere else .
what &apos;s life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of really big <unk> molecules in the same size of dna and protein and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon .
we want to put them into the environment , and we want them to get rid of their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and matter to make matter , <unk> , then that will be life in action .
there &apos;s a second reason why i like this <unk> : every one you can measure .
and these are highly professional female <unk> for an hour and sit for an hour , and she &apos;s asking them to her <unk> .
i was sitting on friday in friday , my computer , and i could see , like the <unk> on this morning .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of it .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make any sense of a <unk> of a <unk> improvement , which is not a very quick progress .
but you don &apos;t talk so much .
they were high high , or very high , child mortality and the families were very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s also .
whatever is worth more value for money .
yeah , i went barefoot until i was 12 .
and he said to them , &quot; i think the <unk> .
the whole time was a frontier .
and <unk> , according to my mind , the world will make a difference , not just for a few of them , but for everyone .
... above the knee , yes , that &apos;s hard ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everyone &apos;s needs , but not everyone &apos;s greed .
and <unk> .
i went to high school .
when i was the council of scientific research , when i was working on the council of scientific research , 40 laboratories -- when two <unk> don &apos;t work together , i built teams .
they &apos;ve got to have , and now i have apps apps .
it &apos;s about to perfect an old and a little bit of the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more <unk> .
because this reactor is not under high pressure , and chemically <unk> is so reactive , meaning that the <unk> don &apos;t tend to leave the reactor .
and i believe that the reactor that i designed here is a cutting-edge power of energy , the great scientific projects with electricity , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move into a <unk> where the experience of the product is .
there &apos;s a <unk> that makes the <unk> <unk> , for the case they go in the forest .
so , at the end of a long time , good advice he &apos;s <unk> his son , he says this , &quot; especially , is <unk> against you .
normally in los angeles , you normally don &apos;t have a lot , but there &apos;s a place where you can run a lot out of it out in this town .
and then they &apos;re going to be wrong as a <unk> -- <unk> properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was a little , i was very introverted , and i &apos;d like to just like to myself .
and then it was just about to start at a point and then you end up to the end .
so i made it out of concrete because it doesn &apos;t matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
for 25 days : the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : arms and hands on 36 days : the primitive <unk> begins to train those weeks , where the fetus evolves .
the complexity , this is in a single system , in a single system , beyond each other , or any present today .
because apparently there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stars .
so what can you make ?
so recently , a colleague of berkeley sent me a colleague of berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you see this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- in which matter and chemical elements in the universe , and it will be <unk> .
because , can you imagine that anything ?
now , imagine an object , an incredible object , or something we can &apos;t do , and we &apos;re just saying , &quot; so , let &apos;s put on . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and when we see <unk> , oxygen , then , i think , we have the perfect truths .
i mean , just like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you to do is universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m a very addicted to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a little collapse -- -- actually , actually , looked like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is , no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what &apos;s going to be vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you &apos;re not right . shut up .
we pretend what we do , is not an impact on other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , you know , making systematic improvements , we think we think about how to be useful , for the <unk> and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so , steven is a story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this <unk> , so that these were the only ones that were online and available online .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have <unk> , you don &apos;t have data , it &apos;s not based on scientific methods .
this is the curve &apos;s <unk> .
but my brother &apos;s not going to end with him .
now , if we went from here today , we &apos;d put on something that &apos;s going on , it would be 300 feet tall , 120 miles wide , 20 miles wide , and that &apos;s two degrees .
to change the state , you need only two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can make it better .
but there is a fascinating solution that &apos;s called what &apos;s called <unk> .
these are networks networks are <unk> complex systems .
and it also has implications to systemic risk .
so we could give each other a <unk> .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs , which is the <unk> world , our connected world from standpoint .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity to <unk> <unk> -- unless you get expensive pumps and the valves .
and we had 500 of these books .
without human <unk> .
so we were up on our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that data is invented .
and my brain starts to think very quickly is that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> to the world .
because the question is ahead of our external world , our external world can predict our <unk> , but the truth is that i only can predict 10 percent of the <unk> one person , if i can predict the entire external world .
and this is for two reasons , scientifically , <unk> around .
we move people to do when they open their <unk> , a positive email from the <unk> or the <unk> of somebody in your social environment .
hard to say -- a <unk> , you know -- my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and so i went . i went to mit closed .
they said , do it stop .
they take a giant disk in cardboard .
he was the first digital <unk> in tokyo .
do you hear that ? how cows ? this is the morning 4 .
so there &apos;s all these things to do , but most of the love i love to experience the world .
and i follow the passion with passion .
their culture is not in schools . and i want to see you see how we can overcome this problem .
so this is because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools that there &apos;s no boys in which there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers , who are raised young ?
we need to change attitudes to boys in elementary school .
and you have the idea that you think that would be okay .
let &apos;s see where we &apos;re going to put this hypothesis .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give us this &quot; why &quot; <unk> evidence about the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me to have no object .
we created a newspaper , for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected to my ipad with my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> -- so i &apos;m going to <unk> them to a <unk> , so that people respond to the glass in the glass , if you &apos;re going to get them .
i &apos;m going to turn into a middle-aged man in a middle-aged man , and then in an old man .
<unk> extra extra allowed .
radio : what do you think about it ?
fold them up just the wings and drive them .
so i ask you another question .
and he had made a <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , who had instruction , and night to <unk> , but with the secret instruction , it doesn &apos;t particularly good good at <unk> .
because they &apos;ve found that the human behavior is stronger .
and yet , we need to create a <unk> <unk> , where you can create that kind of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair fair .
now , if we all have these tools available to have these tools , we need to ask ourselves the question -- and scott and <unk> did this -- how we use these smart devices .
they lead the new <unk> .
they make little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt passion , the soul and heart , had my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not . &quot;
all around us , <unk> <unk> shares another replicator in this <unk> of culture .
you probably have bought them .
imagine the world &apos;s full of brains , and more memes than space for them .
we &apos;re the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
it was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to make the resource of the planet , to produce more and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and we &apos;re going to see this third problem , how we &apos;ve got the second and first ?
in conjunction with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the ministry of the ministry of the ministry of the ministry of the ministry of public <unk> , with various <unk> , we <unk> more than 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t cost us more , if we do it right . &quot;
and because i was <unk> 70 percent of my body , it took me an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , i would have to put myself in the pain to recover from pain .
and how bad would the sentence , if i caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the <unk> people -- the ones that have more commandments -- less than <unk> , and that &apos;s the less religious -- those less religious -- the people who could not remember anything -- more <unk> .
so if you don &apos;t think for a couple of seconds you don &apos;t think about cash because you get a brand , does it matter ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think that all these forces have very bad impact on the stock market .
but you can think of me . i work in advertising .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and all of a sudden , amazon and competing for brand <unk> , as you want to spend your money , what money is and what it is .
maybe it seems to be a big leap ?
in the audience , i don &apos;t have to talk to it -- last week i had to make it , last week i had to make it -- <unk> , the sperm from an individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> , or even most of the animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissues , by using bone .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found out to <unk> in nature , across the same <unk> .
all i showed this was really surprised this .
a funny song about global warming , by jill .
well , then i need to know .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> was totally <unk> and ben became a <unk> .
go ahead , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home to the democratic republic of the congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> , the <unk> of the united nations has been estimated the power of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they need to be very inexpensive .
but could not be done for those angles of the <unk> ?
they demanded of government support , and in many cases they &apos;ve got them .
but let &apos;s take a look at our goal , new economic act on the ground of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profit .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed .
since the <unk> , as sir <unk> , and the british society for <unk> means that it seems to be the sun .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something <unk> .
and this is what energy is .
so it &apos;s like conventional <unk> .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the biggest arab country and is also a big impact .
they wanted most of democracy to democracy , but they were all countries who were at the <unk> in the last month of the last month , their opinion had been reported only four percent .
but the expectation of people in the future are significantly significant .
so the question is , &quot; what are the men going on for women for women ? &quot;
i promise you , you know .
nobody can listen to them , they just send a text .
you could see the immediate effects of the laws , or the <unk> talk on a <unk> , and see what &apos;s going on .
flight took 12 seconds and went through 35 .
this is a rocket for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
from the smallest <unk> to the <unk> forces of the nature of nature .
we can afford it as an individual , and we &apos;re hearing .
we think that somebody else is different , somebody <unk> , somebody <unk> , somebody who &apos;s going to solve this problem .
we flew it into the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes , until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s this incredible <unk> of what &apos;s possible , and this is what &apos;s possible , and this is what it means .
and let &apos;s think about our moral space .
and the warden was quite <unk> , and he said to me that he was mad . and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are severe .
it took several things , until i figured out what i should do .
and when i was four years ago , my <unk> plan was a <unk> plan of <unk> <unk> .
and they look at <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i was 15 years ago , the audacity to live in life at nyu , and in my home home , where i was doing this incredible <unk> with this group of <unk> kids .
and how many times my own die would die before i understand that it didn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly enough , <unk> these findings don &apos;t feel my <unk> self-worth , this feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t know what was in between .
imagine that what kind of existence we could do when we honor the <unk> of the self , the privilege of life , and what &apos;s the privilege of what &apos;s going on .
and this is a cafe in britain .
but instead of looking at that appearance , we focused on how much .
and we also discovered that as a <unk> structure and a <unk> way through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project -- this really important project -- but that seeds -- in the leading <unk> gardens , seed seed issued .
we teamed up with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of the seed seed , so that , even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it &apos;s kind of <unk> and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few of the ones that you see , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate &quot; the blank slate , the popular idea of the human mind is a blank slate , and all his structure of its fortunes , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that they &apos;re good for people .
it &apos;s actually not clear that these projections are actually <unk> , but then the <unk> seemed to be able to sustain this .
another of the <unk> and <unk> at the universities that are actually in the decline in <unk> terms .
well , the other hot iron iron is the afterlife .
and i think you can &apos;t tell it better .
i &apos;m also going to <unk> <unk> , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you &apos;ll tell it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m living in a computer program -- this is weird .
so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we &apos;ve explained to the war , as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people , the same skin , the same circuitry , the same keyboard , always over and over again .
and then it &apos;s got bigger and <unk> and so it &apos;s <unk> pages long .
and i said to brian , &quot; what tony did tony ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you &apos;re in ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a mentally normal way ?
so , all of these things that went on to tony <unk> , proof , according to his <unk> , that he was in this new way .
he came in <unk> <unk> and <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , american cities are just in <unk> .
and i added to , &quot; i have a list of <unk> features in my pocket .
and they &apos;re always the far aspects of the personality of the interviewee .
anyway , that was two years ago , and this is where my book ended .
in fact , the trend of the rest is the rest of the world .
and as a result of this operation , it &apos;s a very difficult thing to say , i &apos;m <unk> of the real islam . &quot;
it may be a big war between east east and west <unk> , and that it was in the framework of democracy against communism .
and despite the president , for <unk> reasons , very well , very well , on the <unk> of islam &apos;s not the enemy , there is nonetheless , a natural impulse to <unk> the other side to the enemy .
as a result in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best <unk> , which scientists had ever had been at the peak of the best , the scientists for african penguins had ever collected -- at this stage as an endangered species .
the day after our arrival , two of us were arrived with two of us with space 2 , and two times more than 4,000 oiled oiled penguins .
we have this technique in the treasure rescue once .
and this is really important , because the african penguin was explained to an endangered penguin .
at <unk> row , on the <unk> row , in front of a <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police .
people are open open for the <unk> .
we launched this campaign -- very , very fun -- called &quot; every noise . &quot;
this is not a <unk> of the second grade .
and they appear to be <unk> , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s <unk> to you do that your neighbors do not . this is the rest of the rest .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes <unk> <unk> and sending him to his father , and the two men look at each other and recognize each other than divine .
so this sort of view of cells really has really been into biology and science , looking at the view of living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this picture was the beginning of the <unk> .
we &apos;re all right from inside , believe me .
the walls are out of 700 inches thick , solid concrete concrete .
and that &apos;s on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little <unk> in the edges .
i had to have to the car in the middle of the <unk> , for themselves .
yes , they have 12 monkeys for a week , and after that week , they &apos;ve just used them as toilet .
the science is actually saying that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i <unk> a <unk> .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not going to agree .
not professor and <unk> , just two ghosts , ready to <unk> .
and then my life was okay .
everything i looked at was that there was right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
if i was time to process the information ?
so we spent a lot of time , a billion dollars of business , and you can hear right now — a billion <unk> <unk> <unk> , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but more .
there &apos;s dan etete .
we were struck by the fact that these shell companies were going to <unk> their <unk> and the most important in london .
it &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be the old . we &apos;re going to leave people . people leave us .
there are places where you can &apos;t go , you know , thoughts you can &apos;t think of the worlds that you can &apos;t .
they have a <unk> and a freedom of which i think is the foundation of a new <unk> .
she made the decision to have no <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but her life was to that , that &apos;s no other girls .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you put me this thing on your head , and then it happens .
but this isn &apos;t . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find it , his staff were <unk> , and they said , &quot; you go in the recovery , or you &apos;ll be fired and dying . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the <unk> . let &apos;s pull out .
if it is in the box that the <unk> is , then it makes it .
the characteristics of the word suggests that we &apos;re often seeing in the adult , that we should abolish this age of <unk> word , when it comes to criticize behavior , which is associated with <unk> and <unk> .
if i was the ability of my sister , the 10 percent of interest in the back of my sister that i <unk> on her last loan , i &apos;m going to get her ability to get more money from me until she would get it back .
it &apos;s why we live more in the dark days .
and the third is all sound that we &apos;re creating people who are <unk> .
this is after selective <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> from <unk> , including the way , like the animals and sing , i &apos;ve been taught that i have a different <unk> .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much this is like , this <unk> is 16 .
so , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very nice concert .
and these are the topics that are actually at the heart .
one generation that makes so much more meaning from video games , as the real world .
all these are problems outside my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of games is for our civilization .
finally ! i was .
it would be really good .
so , you get quickly from simple to the complex , if you make more power . we like .
and then you <unk> them , and it &apos;s a <unk> -- i thought , at least for a long time , until she explained to me , this is what you think .
it would go to the other direction .
girl : there were a sphere and a <unk> , because it &apos;s two very different <unk> , and if you drop them at the same time , they might fall , they fall <unk> .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
ultimately , we will change ourselves as well as we have the world around us .
that &apos;s an incredible impact .
why do you do what you do ?
everyone would like the new version .
it affects us too .
they &apos;re actually in the same time .
i &apos;m going back in the order of his words again .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; yeah , you know .
you know , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
we saw that , and i was grateful , because she &apos;s just said , &quot; wow ! this is madness . &quot;
so the goal of project is very simple .
this is very personalized medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a <unk> team .
i &apos;m working with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is some serious problems in the project , problems that it shouldn &apos;t be .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change , rather than an <unk> engineer the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen yet , and that very quickly , and simple .
yeah , well , you know , your guy &apos;s got my life , because <unk> times , from beautiful <unk> shape .
no , but it &apos;s true , the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to be nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth taught me a lot about the meeting with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of the animals on this planet as you &apos;ve been here , until we have the second microbial age .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin <unk> across the planet , and we had a very <unk> death of dinosaurs , death of these beautiful <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and so much .
it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of his time .
they hate us .
this is when material comes from the deep earth and the surface is distributed to the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> from the coast away , what will happen to me ?
they have an accident . you have two options : you &apos;ll die , or you take the hydrogen sulfide , and you say , 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of them are countries who are opinion , who are the opinion that <unk> , or not regulation , the best way to be investing in investing .
the answer is simple : the chinese are used to these factories as chemical businesses , and they don &apos;t check .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can &apos;t use my office to bring them together to a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the idea that it &apos;s in the beginning of a new kind of new form and a regulation of the regulation .
human rights are going to become a very simple question : can i go back to this person ?
or to find the boy that started to find the fire , to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready , ready ?
i was fire .
again , we saw how the word poetry of poetry walls .
after the fight , he shook his <unk> , <unk> hair , and she said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &quot;
i travel a lot when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students do their third step in the third step , but i had the fortune to see that their journey evolved as they did .
my parents introduced me to me , which is a <unk> name .
i want to talk about some of some ideas that inspired me to become a <unk> .
when i saw that the war was such an incredibly <unk> consequences for anyone such , and that could be a factor of <unk> in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a <unk> .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela made out of prison mandela from prison , the black population was the last phase of the liberation of apartheid .
the next day i went to rwanda , and it was , as if i was in the <unk> into the hell of hell in hell .
after the fall of <unk> in indonesia , i started to explore the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way for modernization .
a hospital of physicians without borders , &quot; in a refugee camp .
it &apos;s so efficient that &apos;s so efficient , that the percentage of soldiers who live in this war is much higher than any other in our history .
so to make sure that &apos;s how could be wrong as possible , we have all these procedures .
so you use this way .
but that &apos;s a very hard and pretty hard topic , so i had to be .
the size of the population -- here &apos;s a big china , here &apos;s a big china here .
and in all eastern religions , there was the level of the magnitude .
because the death of a child is <unk> with another child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all the religions in the world are able to maintain their values and apply to this new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
day eight .
in india , my favorite best friends were best friends and i went door to door with this same picture , to every single house in india . we took over a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all <unk> -- and i asked them to ask them to ask them .
i think we owe to the <unk> and ron st. john &apos;s very much gratitude , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- there &apos;s the founders of gphin .
larry brilliant : first , they &apos;re not angry for the injury of the injury to the injury ?
have a <unk> set , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , in the world , as a company ?
they &apos;re going to save 85 percent of electricity with an <unk> light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent will be pretty hard , and we had this conversation in business .
a <unk> pay himself in seven or eight years .
by all the time we &apos;re in <unk> , there are 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to close this gap , and this way up to the high management consequences .
there was a equation in my family , like this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not going to be spiritual .
this is , he wrote , &quot; is the victorian structure of reality . &quot;
somebody who thinks that they could make it or make them a point of view .
at the end of our <unk> , we realized the openness of the other .
as i was going to bangalore , i would often go to bangalore discussion with my friends home , where we discussed various issues , while they were <unk> about new <unk> , where a minimum laptop often costs more than what they paid for her 14 years old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said that he wants to fight life with his child child .
this may seem quite happy to be happy , and no deaths had no deaths , even though we were killed dozens of <unk> in liberia .
and how are we responsible for that ?
it &apos;s troubling -- isn &apos;t it ? -- that the media &apos;s media , that a small group of activists in the situation is able to publish more of this information than the rest of the <unk> together .
j yeah . that was the front page in the guardian , and it &apos;s got about kenya in all countries around kenya , and south african press .
j the impact on the people who were working on it was considerably .
and there &apos;s lots of information .
i would be interested in just because of what we &apos;ve heard already -- i &apos;m curious about this ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you &apos;ve got to be careful with the <unk> hacker .
and just a month ago , this was all of the <unk> parliament passed off .
and from all these numbers , i start with just two or three variables .
this piece here can be very different , depending on where you <unk> it .
first , i read about this in a contract for a <unk> , which is the between the <unk> for <unk> medicine and seven <unk> .
so , according to this research is the best <unk> for a chicken for a chicken , but not too long , it &apos;s going to be black , until it gets black and a <unk> of <unk> , brown sugars .
and then in the next summer , i worked under the line of dr. <unk> at dr. <unk> <unk> <unk> , texas .
and this is a realization for the efficiency of chemotherapy , maybe for many different types of cancer .
for example , volatile organic compounds are volatile chemical pollutants that are in our schools , care and care at the time .
because all these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they are <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; aha ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
weightfully !
a prosthesis is no longer for the need , a lack of <unk> .
we &apos;re all different perspectives from different perspectives .
i was like a solar station for a solar olympics .
about 80 percent of these <unk> are young people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of europe and america who produce them .
they have a kind of devices that you can draw on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like beef .
people think about questions : are we going to become our environment for one more higher of the victims ?
there &apos;s nothing to eat there , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
now , the one series was not going on , so they &apos;re the first ones to see this .
mars is more similar than the earth , it seems to be the same thing .
sousa was scared of the way that we &apos;re going through this , quote , &quot; <unk> , &quot; you would take you .
but a lot more important was that maddie &apos;s been available in general works to create new <unk> that they were free to produce for free , then in 1940 , as a <unk> <unk> , the majority of people who were attracted to bmi .
and i ...
for the <unk> , for me , i &apos;m trying to try and be , i &apos;m trying to ask as a good , of course , of course , something from the government to desire .
this is an insight <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
okay , i don &apos;t want to leave you here , but i &apos;m just noticed that the person on the right is beside you .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see it doesn &apos;t fat . &quot;
another study showed that strangers are three times within the first 10 minutes of their own meeting .
here &apos;s her kittens with her kittens .
i &apos;m going to say it again .
<unk> don &apos;t look liars in the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake your head .
so the science has very much more excited for daylight .
look at the right and you &apos;re going to see the whole video of the <unk> smile .
in this way , a lot of the world can make it sense for us to make a little clearer in terms of our moral rules .
and that &apos;s not right now , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world that we live in , literally , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s when you <unk> , if not a tragic joke about <unk> <unk> , <unk> as ethnic <unk> .
six months after it , no one explanation , let me free .
that &apos;s what interests me .
when i was 10 , i went to james <unk> , &quot; <unk> country , &quot; and in this book , i was broken .
a new song i hit you .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you apply to you based on the effects that you act on these <unk> villages ?
don &apos;t <unk> me as pleasant as &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re waiting for being cut .
a lot more people would be infected .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first of what we &apos;ve lost , and the second we lost .
here you can see the biggest portion of the living creatures of the <unk> of florida .
if there is no fishing in a reef , because it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , eat the sea coast , and then they grow the algae again .
you can see the boundary of the <unk> , because they &apos;re all the <unk> .
if it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so the protection of the sea , and the seas has become a <unk> for funding by governments and <unk> institutions , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we have found that the pyramid of the sun is the equivalent of the <unk> , where five lions come on .
okay , <unk> , thank you for a part of your spiritual experience . thank you . thank you .
it &apos;s got the largest creatures in the sea .
they come up to the submersible -- they come up with the eyes on the window and watch a submarine .
among other other trials , we &apos;re trying to woods our partners in the woods , this virtual world -- this virtual world -- this particular area -- in the lab .
bl : these worms have no <unk> . they have no mouth .
so what we &apos;ve seen in the pacific was out of the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in <unk> .
these worms are growing several inches in the week .
the concept is futile .
and the rest of one percent look in the formula after the formula is to apply it to the situation .
you also have the mathematical structure , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , dots , axles , axles .
students have to combine these things . they need to make it .
and the best one or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t answer the answer to the end of the <unk> .
what &apos;s the small hadron collider is happening ?
this is the fastest growing growing young population in the world .
it &apos;s <unk> . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that &apos;s at the entrance at the entrance to her slum , by a <unk> social entrepreneur called sugata mitra , who showed that kids under certain conditions , could be able to learn that children under certain conditions .
well , the key is motivation , and in two ways .
this is a school in a bus on pune , the fastest growing city of asia .
it &apos;s supposed to turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there &apos;s formal framework , schools , <unk> , <unk> , hospitals that can take place , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child at the age of 15 who wants to be a place in one school in a school , going to be 2015 .
and as i looked at him , this scene that led me to tears , and i &apos;ve been <unk> for 25 years .
so here &apos;s a few parents of teenagers who have to cook for them -- all we have to cook -- and you get every night for two , three or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
it &apos;s all over all over all over all over the left .
these gay people , people like me to be treated as fully citizens , and it &apos;s just about our nose .
there &apos;s people to worry about their job , so they don &apos;t show you who are really , here at home , it &apos;s not just north carolina ; it &apos;s not just north carolina .
think about it .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us that what we could have .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and actually , here &apos;s this insect .
i mentioned a little bit about somebody .
it heats not just 43 to 44 degrees fahrenheit for about two days , but it &apos;s a constant temperature .
but the contrast is in something like that . it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
here , the americans , the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started to tell me about , and all the parents will recognize the <unk> .
i have a <unk> history .
our lives is defined by data , and the presentation is this data for us to create an opportunity to create fantastic interfaces , which is great stories .
i also have a look at the <unk> <unk> , because you can select what you want to highlight from the data .
it &apos;s a <unk> guy who controls in the box and these <unk> controls .
a <unk> of about 11 sheep an hour , which is an hour of 68 cents .
so you can -- what you see on the left -- what you see on the left is the <unk> , and on the right you see the <unk> as it was by 16 people who had no idea what they do .
hilary bell : the <unk> , <unk> ... aaron <unk> : and we took all these pieces and put them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew that we could actually needed the right person needed to ask us to make it and we could build something .
and it &apos;s all the individual <unk> that people have submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of pictures , cut , and put them in <unk> together .
so a <unk> consequence is that you always see a part of his image , and that leads to a very free structure .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to the news , as the quake earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 miles , 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of which we are doing , and what we present to the world as our identity is present .
another <unk> is in a public library in san jose in san jose , california .
so every buildings has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier than ever before , a good thing to get to secure .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
it &apos;s just too weird .
you know , in the middle ages , in the u.k. , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this one , &quot; unhappy , somebody who , the fortune , the fortune , the fortune , the fortune , the fortune .
and that &apos;s what he &apos;s going to do with the youngest court with angels and <unk> , and the sky will open .
i told them the act of <unk> <unk> .
what i think i think really is success is success and failure .
we should make sure we should make sure that we really are the creator of our own <unk> .
alain de botton : a <unk> , <unk> <unk>
if you train them to train these exercise , they don &apos;t smile .
you know , you throw it with a <unk> goggles , and you get 60 degrees a minute , you &apos;re never going to be a little <unk> , you don &apos;t see good .
they &apos;re in the liquid <unk> .
my breath is down to three <unk> .
i should make care about it , i didn &apos;t care about it .
i swam in this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> i &apos;m interested in .
now this is already today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it could be a <unk> <unk> , like today , many of these things are special , because they &apos;re not so good integrated .
many of you have the vertical direct life direct life .
this is an important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . so let &apos;s go from your sleep to disease .
so we can change the medicine in the <unk> , all ages , from <unk> or <unk> children to the elderly ; the whole spectrum is changing ; i hope i &apos;ll give you a sense of that -- around the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you that the impact on the <unk> are enormous , and the effects that are enormous and the effects are so stunning in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , one particular called alvin , and he &apos;s got it , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s <unk> the whole system .
and so we wouldn &apos;t be there .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
<unk> should be faster .
maybe you ask how we do these <unk> .
our is the only cookbook in the world , in the <unk> <unk> .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robot is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more successful than doctors .
but ultimately , the woke up .
they had to give their intuitive movement with the instruments .
i have them from the big , complicated robots .
and as you can see , it &apos;s like to do something useful , can &apos;t stay so <unk> .
and we don &apos;t need to stop on those <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we &apos;ve not just shown that bacteria could be the solution for plastic plastic , but also that the openness is to <unk> the openness to the <unk> and make it by making unexpected discoveries .
the film that we &apos;re going to see is going to be the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it continued . they always have tried to make things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house . &quot;
i think in my family , we had a lot of luck . because we &apos;ve learned design .
ah , very good !
ed : and then <unk> row is a historic <unk> , because there &apos;s a <unk> story in the <unk> of paris here in the beginning to where the message was .
you see this chair ? the orange orange ? that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
because it &apos;s part of what we want to do .
they were <unk> of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were <unk> . no solid information .
one of them is known : the population explosion , the population of two to almost seven billion people over the last 50 years .
brent <unk> : nice here .
you see the lines look like the population explosion .
before i ever talk about the cost , i need to be very clear .
this is actually liberation .
but only recently we can , thanks to technical progress , now the <unk> and quantum locking shows .
first of all strands of field inside the inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it , if you move out , there &apos;s your motions of energy , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
these <unk> magnet can also expand , of course , to form some of the features .
and it was inspired by douglas adams . the situation is coming from &quot; by moving through the galaxy . &quot;
because they don &apos;t want to tell you how to do it , if you don &apos;t want to do it , and no <unk> .
but even though they didn &apos;t believe they said , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot; -- never .

this graph is based on a brand-new article that will appear in the <unk> of the scientific biology .
but this is not just everything .
as an architect , i have something like this .
mitchell <unk> : don &apos;t build a house , they &apos;re growing it .
i think that &apos;s very interesting and very , very <unk> , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of it , directions that are specific and unique for problems .
well , we all think that <unk> is obviously a great romantic poets , many of us forgot that he wrote a few wonderful <unk> , and the most famous essay is &quot; a defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read them .
and at a certain time of his life , it &apos;s <unk> on rocks .
but let me show you the latest picture .
if you used to , before the digital radio , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; on the <unk> .
so the basic idea of <unk> is that you have two sources of information that &apos;s going to conclusions .
that means i think i have to make predictions about the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear example of where one of my <unk> <unk> looks very different than when it was produced by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if you were on a <unk> car , you would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
so we showed that we can explain a big part of the data -- people plan to actually explain their movements in all the way to minimize the negative consequences of noise .
this is from the <unk> of marine kingdom .
mars has the largest <unk> of the solar system of the solar system .
this is my <unk> . it was just a couple of weeks ago .

what a place like david david is remarkable , is this sort of <unk> where people have a foundation that they can make themselves .
we can just ask , &quot; what is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot; and you know it immediately -- or what we want to ask .
it has been replaced by technology .
you can see some of the symbols on the screen some of some symbols look at what is poor with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even if we &apos;re much older , our cars are driving our cars , so we can visit people .
they were in a moment .

the two specialists behind the curtain will help me make the outcome .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , just like <unk> .

he was sent away by his head , he was like a <unk> for light , a little <unk> .
so let me go from door to door to the international community , and see if i could give me a <unk> or troops to these .
but it was too late for sergio .
he saw her .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is the jobs and possibilities of all the <unk> .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> of food , because it &apos;s actually this year , last year , and in 2008 , there &apos;s plenty of food there .
and i &apos;m going to go into these shops when they &apos;re there , or into the fields , to see what you can get , and i think they can &apos;t get food .
we see changes from participation in schools through girls .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i &apos;ve found is that instead of <unk> and other things , they invest , invest in a school school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to be a <unk> longer .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s related to the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many <unk> i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours long what i do .
it &apos;s never been shown .
so the <unk> of these magnets is so large , that we can see that technology is a single neutron .
you can &apos;t shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and you can actually get your resolution up high enough , then they can actually <unk> all the proteins in the body and begin to understand the individual system .
most of us find it , and interestingly , 12 cycles per minute about the <unk> of a human <unk> .
if i like to run this -- -- more than a couple of seconds , you would feel uncomfortable ; it &apos;s more than a few minutes , and you would go to the room .
they &apos;ve got everyone . and this is the melody that &apos;s melody at the time in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends of mine , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
as we cross miles and miles away from <unk> cross -- <unk> <unk> .
so as i stand here today , and i &apos;m talking to you , i &apos;m about five years ago .
ten miles off the coast and <unk> feet depth .
the oceans determine climate and weather , they think about temperature &apos;s stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
<unk> there are easy ...
that &apos;s the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries of what we need to take the oceans .
over the last three years , the u.s. for example , is <unk> square miles of sea fields than <unk> .
we need <unk> , new technologies to study the ocean .
most of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of insects have enough enough to keep in the air .
let &apos;s explore this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful image of visual <unk> of a mouse from jeff <unk> , and you can see the wonderful pictures of brains that he showed in his talk .
you <unk> <unk> to any behavior , another <unk> , another <unk> has another <unk> and patterns and you can think that this is in a very complicated complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you see the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s made of a little bit of <unk> components . <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many per tree are there ? where are they run ?
we can look at the tissue , and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , each one in your own processor , and it activate , and what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain will be able to be solved . mental , memory , memory : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he plan to find them with a supercomputer that &apos;s the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs bombs .
so the air force started to build smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get an <unk> to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s an amazing time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance you can get from people .
the bottom line ? yellow .
if you ask them that question , think about that question , they usually think about it with the culture .
the countries on the right , those are the very much different form , they have a very different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but it goes back to get more complex .
a online <unk> for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we &apos;re really not as good .
in fact , in medical terms , this is our view of view .
and radio waves are limited .
infrared -- can you only use to protect your eyes with less energy .
its intensity can be very quickly , and it can be very quick .
they &apos;re critical .
but it &apos;s just by the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> lights can communicate with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s mean , which is mean , is mean .
it &apos;s actually not as much data .
you have to be the <unk> of the genome , and the power of this regenerative medicine is better than -- it has no side effects .
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just <unk> genes -- but we were able to get it completely .
we don &apos;t run as small organisms alone around the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we poison the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now , i &apos;m mainly here , because it &apos;s a kind of <unk> at the moment , where we have people who think you &apos;re a dog <unk> , first by creating rules , first by creating rules , first by creating human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; <unk> , &quot; just to beat . and so they &apos;re going to beat them .
no , we &apos;re doing , &quot; puppy , sit , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try it .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , it should not be .
not just equipped with it , but also with the rest of the family .
these <unk> are so simple .
their children are easy to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- it works ?
wk : yeah . i still think about energy .
because even though i used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to make them sound .
and even less less than <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
the one is a white flash of light .
64 percent is 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the <unk> <unk> is a mile or two per year .
so the homo erectus made the same thing about 30 generations .
and you can teach them a little bit of <unk> , and there &apos;s actually a little <unk> of practice , and there &apos;s actually a <unk> in the act of other animals , but the exchange of an object on another never happens .
it &apos;s the wealth of wealth ; it &apos;s deciding your own needs to save time .
we &apos;ve done that as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence there .
and when people started looking objects like this , it was a clue that a exchange between groups existed between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but this is me because of the connections that people are doing , and the way that never there is a <unk> way of ideas to meet and mate , and i &apos;m sure that the technology will continue to move around and so forth .
this is as high as a <unk> building . i used this as compared here as compared .
we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , usually the problem , because how can we discover things that are constantly changing constantly ?
i &apos;ve talked to -- you know , you know this situation when you &apos;re in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we &apos;re <unk> part of your viruses ; it &apos;s new , so far .
after 10 more days , with a fever came back -- still -- still -- it &apos;s still a fever -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it wasn &apos;t a very common sequence .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has seen it before .
a huge battery could do it .
let &apos;s do something that &apos;s going to fits to the <unk> of the <unk> .
i got a <unk> with low density up with high dense <unk> with high dense and molten salt .
but david is young and clever , and he wants to make a <unk> , and he built the <unk> metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of that ?
this video was taken in <unk> , six miles off the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 feet below the surface of the sea .
so quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to <unk> myself for maria <unk> and her methods and how they were doing these <unk> and how important they found that kids will discover things , and they &apos;re not going to be taught .
evolution is often used as a way that we chose , but it represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the phase of space exploration .
our cities are at risk because many of them are on shore .
there &apos;s also stars and so forth .
so if we think about <unk> behavior or body language , as we call the social social social , then it turns out to be language . so we think about communication .
this phrase , as a pride , known as a pride , by watching katrina , and she showed that people and the birth of birth to blind people to blind people , this will win .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re looking at these people and see how they participate . they could bring them to it , and then they would be involved ?
what happens in a <unk> , what happens when you &apos;re on the <unk> level ? like this little manipulation , these tiny <unk> ?
it &apos;s going to happen in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where can you really apply this ?
these things . people just show her true . they &apos;re showing themselves .
she was completely <unk> and said , &quot; i &apos;m not looking for . &quot;
you need your body , privacy and two minutes , and it can affect the other way that we &apos;re going to affect the other life .
<unk> swimming <unk> to their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> is an ant , <unk> her in your brain , you &apos;re driving a blade of a jeep .
and you need to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i care that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re now extinct .
but , among all these ideas , you will inevitably spread around the world , are many toxic ideas .
and like viruses , we shouldn &apos;t try to destroy them .
and in my game called this , you know .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went on international tour .
i know you &apos;re going to say &quot; t is not in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody &apos;s listening to each other . no one &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a sort of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to go beyond that that shouldn &apos;t have to happen , but we need to be better when it comes to the questions that you need to consider when you follow the consequences and the reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re a driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day , building a <unk> and told me that they shouldn &apos;t be married or kids before these things .
finally , from desperation , they went and <unk> a wise woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to keep the best talk you ever regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connection of everything , and the unity of everything , and his matter was worth respect , kindness against strangers .
who is struggling to do ?
they started to go to israel and palestine , in jordan , in syria , in syria , in syria , in syria .
and so more and more <unk> . and recently , they have a income to support their family .
just just go to somebody , with a different culture , from a different country , with another <unk> that &apos;s kind of different , and you get it in a conversation ; you listen to him .
i &apos;m going to start where the story started , in 1985 .
today morning , before you <unk> , who had the opportunity to take a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer <unk> houses where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re doing is we follow from <unk> , things that are built in the fact that we were installed .
we did that . he went <unk> .
we found later that in this region , the cause of disease and death is .
one thing is in the context of what we did , in the middle of the <unk> , nelson mandela didn &apos;t go far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not <unk> . it &apos;s work from people .
i don &apos;t feel that if you call me a <unk> . really not .
it sounds really <unk> that from here , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s amazing .
with that statement , i &apos;m going to put them into her belief that kids don &apos;t want to rely on their community in a better way .
this is the youngest <unk> workforce in america with our <unk> bronx .
this is a picture of the mayor of bronx who <unk> the children in his house , not in jail , they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you <unk> large children with little <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle of the middle , which is cool , and they create the responsibility of <unk> , which is incredible .
now you wonder maybe about these kids .
hold kids from these shops .
stephen hawking : a teacher , the south bronx
second , i &apos;m betting that , even here as a <unk> , the difference is an increase in the <unk> right here , right after this sharp line .
ten : <unk> , the pig &apos;s pig &apos;s pig .
people with migraine headaches , they have an aura <unk> , they have a band of <unk> neurons -- shown here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeter per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy <unk> for epilepsy -- is a <unk> acronym -- it &apos;s a <unk> acronym -- for treating other other &apos;s <unk> .
the lawyers are taking into <unk> in the hopes of <unk> in the hopes to <unk> the poor patients of the poor patients of compassion .
and a year and a half ago , four from five of the <unk> in ushahidi , which by the way , &quot; <unk> , &quot; is also <unk> .
where do you want to know what is important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i took it to the first time to bring it here .
these people below the <unk> , i call <unk> , because they &apos;re really excluded from the process of the process , you know .
you &apos;ve got to be able to use connexions as a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which is about the world teaching teaching teaching .
yes , books that might be 100 or 1,000 spending a year .
it &apos;s not surprising to all , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of <unk> are over when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or <unk> of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can make a couple of thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s like an electronic book .
everyone says that this is a $ 100 laptop that can &apos;t create .
and this is the <unk> .
you click on things and stare at things . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there is a better way . &quot;
we all play &quot; i love lucy , &quot; i love lucy , and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think most people think that a mother &apos;s mother , is that their child <unk> .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first , the <unk> <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the head at the age of four , the age of four to 22 years , she takes you to see what this graph shows .
the idea that her father is singing in the public , was enough to <unk> .
this is the <unk> we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to install that there was online , 24 hours a day , for nearly nine years .
but at night , as we <unk> , i was asked to the <unk> , like the <unk> decided that they stopped sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working for four generations .
honestly , i have no idea what it was with <unk> , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you &apos;re seeing is the terrible force of the <unk> force .
it just takes it to my leg , she takes me up to a car and i can get me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the floor .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about her . &quot;
we &apos;ve calculated that 200 years is that 200 years of our direct world are .
it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect as technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you , corn is in everything .
you should know that in any community , the number of <unk> are already <unk> .
i took three <unk> to antarctica .
but she tells me where they belong and what country they belong . &quot;
we also have the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we &apos;re faced with the rest of the world in front of a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and the open seas , but the <unk> that everybody wants to look at was in trouble .
here is the pacific , with huge <unk> and huge <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , <unk> <unk> for free of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no way there is no way of it , no response to it , but if you &apos;re a geek , you say , &quot; well , what is the data ? &quot;
instead , it &apos;s accompanied very carefully , whatever happens , if technology for the first time in an environment and in a community .
so there is , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a gorgeous <unk> painting .
i mean , it was at least how it made me happy .
well , there was , of course , a question that would give me a while in <unk> : well , i can do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do this ?
and here it is .
they &apos;re standing in a terrible situation .
they are <unk> in hospitals .
as a <unk> , for example , i was very privileged to look at <unk> , because i knew the <unk> <unk> , and i know how i use <unk> , and i can quickly use the <unk> work quickly .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends that in her 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s still are active as <unk> , and farmers , lawyers and physicians .
as a christian <unk> , and made out of <unk> <unk> , young jewish men in the u.s. and canada and canada , who would turn back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> of europe
the biggest evil , <unk> , doesn &apos;t want these stones to be <unk> , so he &apos;s trying to stop it at the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and when does the article come out ? &quot;
<unk> : there must be something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 . &quot;
it &apos;s dangerous when a group itself is extremely identified .
<unk> <unk> : islam &apos;s <unk>
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it .
let me show you this .
and when i began to design it , i &apos;ve discovered something weird about myself .
so you have the eye and then come the concepts .
but of course , china has a tremendous population .
but what it is , is that this kind of visualizing information is a form of visualizing information .
it &apos;s actually a delight to work with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden of the u.k. project .
why don &apos;t it be like potato or <unk> ? so there &apos;s two theories .
and one theory allows you to work less .
well , after a couple of months , i &apos;ve discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same thing .
this is the basis for the device that these two people built by ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things are going on that i want to pay attention .
and she didn &apos;t have any idea of the context of the context .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anybody on deaf , neither of my mom , nor my sister , my sister , my aunts , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , no .
i heard about it . i &apos;ll just say that i had two things when i left the orphanage i left the orphanage , that was , my family , my family and the other , poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us is walking around and small parts .
he had a <unk> , and he &apos;s got to <unk> from others , female and probably much smaller family had been <unk> to do his age for 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation , or it &apos;s going to lead us to the most of the planet that &apos;s going on on planet earth ?
but will we be able to do that , or we will make nature of the nature .
one day , a couple of weeks or maybe a year later , i was going to store my <unk> in a store for <unk> . i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
that meant a fundamental shift for me .
my thesis : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
i want you to know how am i really ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far on ebay to buy a <unk> newspaper from a <unk> newspaper to buy the bird with it ...
when we went to the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect <unk> : sun , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever run again , it &apos;s just a <unk> . &quot;
and i remember that my father went out on me in a wheelchair , and i was in top of the top , and it felt like it was in my face and it felt the sun on my face .
they said to me , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you beside them , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was at me the <unk> , and i called the school school , i <unk> , and i said that i &apos;d like to make a <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in the world , but i work in this world .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> through a richard serra .
like the hell i &apos;m supposed to do a telephone in three weeks , if i have these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
each of those elements , you could hang on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the ultimate <unk> in <unk> .
i &apos;m looking at a little bit of <unk> and how they flow -- they stretch and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s made out of aluminum .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you think it &apos;s next to contemporary architecture , it feels like this .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was done .
right after i did my ph.d. , i was lucky enough to be a member of a <unk> to his first time to his first time to explore the sea .
there was one of these <unk> .
it &apos;s using red bioluminescence like a <unk> for the animals that are blind to the animals that are blind to red light , and you can see it without being seen .
so they use it to eat and partners .
i urge you to call a different science that &apos;s still used for hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i went to rediscover the value of <unk> .
and on june june june , i heard a loud bang on the wheel that my life was changing and the <unk> one .
and here &apos;s a <unk> .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the effects of <unk> on the lives of birds on birds .
so , if i like something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i <unk> it , i can hear the music music and <unk> .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> , &quot; by martin luther king , and the other one is hitler .
now , you know , you know , you can see that the <unk> are now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything that could be used for one . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens when teachers are willing to order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t stop the law . why don &apos;t trust the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom is a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest thing and the biggest change , we need to have to the authority for the interpretation of the interpretation and practice of the <unk> .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise , they will soon become a halt .
so the boundaries of the interest , the <unk> can compute , and for the taxes that you can take them .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard round round columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job job .
he ended up just a <unk> .
but the problem with rules and incentives to leave , is that they &apos;re doing so severe , they &apos;re <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> in two ways .
so bright <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some smart could be able to be able to get <unk> .
why has this idea ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to push it into something more closely that we -- america and the rest of the world .
this is <unk> , the turtle .
we have to do it with a complete <unk> .
so what i want to show you is , what you need to show is what you need to get over to the world .
what would have been if they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down , and bring the truck that you just saw , somewhere here .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself , the thought of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me by someone &apos;s sent a <unk> of the <unk> , the fact that it was hard .
there &apos;s a lot of black sheep out there that have done the wrong things and the problems .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap into them ?
it &apos;s <unk> , a dangerous environment environment .
imagine we could , because if we could do it , we could do more .
the governments that most of most advances are doing most of the progress are the governments that have found out shared value in business , rather than the government &apos;s actor , which is the one .
maybe i can go here , you know , the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
if you come back to me in the 19th century , this is exactly june june june june .
we could certainly be so productive , if facebook or twitter wasn &apos;t much much time .
it &apos;s got <unk> on the british government to preserve money for the <unk> machines , because they believed that these machines have tremendous practical impacts for society .
these funds not allowed only fewer wealthy men , but they also <unk> them to look at the <unk> , rather than just asking to answer the <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
once you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person has written a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all the ones that are not old enough , they have no idea of what happened -- namely , by these <unk> .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency of which you could find each of the 26 letters of the <unk> in one of randomly chosen to find the <unk> text .
wherever life is , you will have this distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot , too .
the officer asks : &quot; are you safe ? hey , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost this one ? &quot;
these are the data from one single survey to the <unk> in a single district in zambia , a few years ago i &apos;ve got <unk> .
as you can see , bruce was a lot more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time , or it was in my plan , and i wasn &apos;t just on vacation .
instead of teaching people , how to put the forms of paper on the cell phones , we should develop software that would enable you to do it yourself without practice , without exercise .
this is less than i earned at that time for two weeks as a <unk> .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life , or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
it can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
i promised to me that i would take the next time when i could fly around the world , no fuel , independent of the fossil being will to be sure to be safe , not by being threatened by being threatened .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane , the universities can talk to students who can talk to students with politicians , and it &apos;s really a human adventures .
and what &apos;s the objective ?
this is the reason why all people who believe who believe in these minds , welcome to this team .
now you need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is , is what this problem is , and what it is not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
so let &apos;s stop for a second time .
the fact is that we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the disease and the extreme of poverty in the eyes , you see over the ocean , they tell it . we don &apos;t need to stand there .
it &apos;s all the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for us , especially for the leaders of the <unk> states that are <unk> .
people find it slowly .
and with this one campaign when our chute , my organization have , data , data , and other groups of the energy and the outside of hollywood to go out from hollywood to the south of america .
: step for step , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a housewife , and life saved .
the idea that the internet is changing , which is changing their lives , a country can change -- and a continent that &apos;s just so done , let &apos;s turn to the head .
lips are no lips , but volcanoes .
now , your job is to see what this shapes is bouba , and what &apos;s kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just <unk> , then this sentence is literally wrong .
if we &apos;re going to solve a problem or something new discovery , we compare what we already know about , what &apos;s known .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit into all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think .
so what are you doing with this , you personally , but also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
now , this shows quite a different image of yemen .
my heart was a half and a half times .
this is a list of the side side of the side side : if you eat too much salt like a <unk> and <unk> cheese sandwich , then they &apos;re probably in the <unk> .
but soon i showed symptoms of <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i would never see my home again .
i was sitting there , and i talked about little excited with the <unk> for <unk> and asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant .
i was on a dozen machines that i thought about life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> is also about 200 percent in the united states for 200 percent .
also , interesting is that the same business that we sold 80 million pounds of atrazine sold the &quot; <unk> , &quot; today , the antidote to sell -- and the same company .
we also started as <unk> .
what would our young children say to us , if you saw every day , i had a little bit of <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little sketchy .
the problem is that you , in my village , oakland , in most of our villages that don &apos;t have this connection .
here &apos;s where you &apos;re looking at this <unk> <unk> next to the airport airport .
i offered five cents for each other .
the <unk> cannot be <unk> , it &apos;s global .
here you see , in red , the distribution of <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that &apos;s going to look at the foot of an elephant , and the biggest part of them are hidden .
they look like their <unk> and <unk> all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that goes into the sky , because it &apos;s a little bit of what you call <unk> -- <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , just like a cathedral of stability , just like a cathedral , and helps the tree to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see this .
but for all of the time , all the doors of the room are open up , and the walls break up .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s start for example .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like <unk> work -- and try to find a way that we &apos;re meeting .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> / d <unk> and if you open this image on your computer , then this program will jump and <unk> .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the <unk> is that .
we need to find any way to make sure that everything happens , even though the computer .
but i have nothing to do with that .
this person around with a <unk> .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does his future ?
this ignores all the way completely , no one of the 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and this kind of calculation would take seriously , and it would happen , because it would change things in two ways .
so that means that we can recognize a copy of ourselves , if you just get a piece of <unk> , that &apos;s in slow motion , and it &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came from their <unk> back , and saw that her video had spread like a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;ll go to the distance .
this is what taught him to do , and he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor as a mentor , who taught me how to <unk> .
what &apos;s it is that you turn to life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you <unk> and do it happen ?
didn &apos;t -- time . didn &apos;t -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in that moment , you know , consciously , or unconsciously , at the moment where you &apos;re <unk> , you can focus on something you can , and whatever it does is , it makes emotion .
you &apos;ve ever done what done , and i went to mit , &quot; i was ! &quot;
so to <unk> , god in his infinite wisdom gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy through friendship , through prayer , through <unk> in nature .
and there &apos;s seven different convictions . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m walking through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with a family in <unk> area , somebody in new york , who had died when he was working on the day at the day , and this man was being a terrorist , and it &apos;s quite clear .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating tools with a large number of people to tell their stories with a large number of people around the world .
the color of the particles is the kind of feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts walking around , and there are thousands of feelings that are collected collected .
the ten issues of radiation and circle around the time .
it &apos;s called &quot; the universe . &quot;
we can actually click this , and see this particular image of betty ford , like she &apos;s killing the <unk> of her husband .
you can see , you can see quotes if you want to read to the climate change .
so people think clouds as something that is in ways .
in the lives . it has tens of thousands of members in nearly 100 countries around the earth .
you just need a step out of out for the outside , and the reason that &apos;s usually the usual is so banal , is that everybody else are missing .
so look high , admire them , admire them , and they &apos;re always thinking about the head in the clouds .
they would have 25,000 shots that would have done this : &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> <unk> to buy my first <unk> . it was a giant machine .
this footage from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see how the knife is .
it &apos;s a little , <unk> pen , which is very , very fast in its inner inner <unk> .
now , this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very skilled people .
i went to the kids as often as possible for the kids to bring the academic material in the very real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details , why we think the universe is so , but it makes the math and try to explain the physics that we know .
in the course of my career , there &apos;s always something in me .
in 2001 , i went to them as a <unk> .
we got lots of <unk> .
this is actually showing the first two in 2004 in 2004 .
he &apos;d just been photographed in front of the <unk> and a half ago that you all know .
each will have a <unk> <unk> , but in different scientific disciplines , are specialized .
i got my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really good device .
he explores the brain using the mri and it says , this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned .
so on the next few slides , i &apos;m going to explain to you .
transistors will be smaller to enable that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in technology .
our <unk> is behind this lens .
i had a gut feeling that we do it wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what &apos;s a schwarzschild radius .
i call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
so we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative alternatives that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could have a lot of stuff there .
it pulls on a side of a lot more than the other , and the cloud gets apart .
and i hope at least i &apos;ve convinced you that we actually have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
one day , i was looking at the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between the <unk> , the cars and the fire hydrant .
so for instance , the people liked the 11th of the 11th century pieces of that .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , something was the big idea of &quot; what &quot; in it , &quot; god , &quot; you know .
through new and improved instruments , the age of <unk> .
but one question is , what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings of the time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new <unk> .
until the year 1945 , it took it to 100,000 every year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where to do .
wow , one volunteers , great !
but recently , my interest in this new way through a new way of looking at big <unk> , where there is things really cool .
well , i think this is the <unk> development of the phenomenon that we call &quot; confidence innovation . &quot;
but the element of the desire is really the most important .
we get an incredible talk of them .
let me introduce you to this place sam <unk> .
but even if you <unk> the screen , there is a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
like <unk> worldwide .
first : i have to be a <unk> of the audience to make a service and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of saying what i can &apos;t do .
and they &apos;re having fun to have their own , ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , so kind of <unk> that we call the superpower .
this kind of tests are like this , ok ?
somebody said , &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t it .
i think there are three big changes , and that in the way that we make transparency , choices and <unk> that people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , sharon <unk> , says , around the world , more photos from their head than each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers looked at the <unk> and ipods as a <unk> device , because they took very specific areas where a <unk> sense is good .
so then i wish to all a nice weekend .
dna can read and write a lot easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might ask , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have this whole world , this is how to lead to a <unk> , who is allowed to perform biotechnology .
the kingdom suggests his laws allow him to be <unk> <unk> or <unk> , the economic risk or a <unk> or a risk for health or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are a <unk> in the face of science and based on prejudice and ignorance and <unk> and a <unk> of traditions and a selective <unk> .
why are you going pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of the 10 <unk> people are facing people who inject drugs .
so that &apos;s the social community that condoms are willing to recover from endangered <unk> , not even by the police being tracked , <unk> or <unk> .
here were children born , people died there .
it &apos;s already obsolete to personal work now .
they have the high high high line , the street <unk> , the river underneath the street , and you get from one end to another <unk> to cross the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
we should be shared jobs .
their liver makes <unk> oil .
and they killed around the 12,000 sharks at the time , by just a <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> bay bay .
we know very little about them .
so that tag is the place of a shark , depending on the time , depending on the time and the sunset , the water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> of what to do with the genes that are being passed away from the parent , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , one factor 10 to less diversity than others .
so , <unk> <unk> research and found out that the size of the 9,000 lies .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists , whether it was a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the war .
their bodies are going to be used by <unk> , and they &apos;re destined to be used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell many stories .
no business with no job .
my journalism may be in other continents , or in other countries , in part of my part of africa , but it works . it &apos;s about corruption , asking people immediately , &quot; where are the evidence ?
thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in downtown manhattan , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
and had these people ever realized a victim of their <unk> ?
nowadays , you can see in 29 states in more than half of the country , in more than half of the country .
at some point , i realized that my mission &quot; gays &quot; gays &quot; to photograph &quot; gays &quot; to photograph &quot; gays .
at least i hope that it will be harder to get their human rights .
first : the world is , and it &apos;s always always good , and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and thirdly , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that were made soldiers .
in three ways , the prevailing type is called <unk> .
this is stanley <unk> , a jewish boy from the bronx bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could be the holocaust , right now ? &quot;
&quot; sir , who is responsible when he &apos;s got something ? &quot;
stanley <unk> and i met both of the high school on the high school , at james <unk> in the bronx bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> the other . <unk> itself .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil is through the heart of one person .
and i did this experiment for the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that was really hard .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , is a <unk> , which is through the red arrow .
there &apos;s just a <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i nothing to say nothing except that it &apos;s supposed to be .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory memory , thinking of creativity and language .
thank you nice . thank you for the <unk> -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i tell you this -- i &apos;m making it <unk> , because i think feminism is partly the job , to admit , the aesthetic and beauty and fun and fun and fun .
we don &apos;t want to be a hero .
you know , i didn &apos;t know about fire .
she was talking about <unk> , she founded <unk> , she <unk> , they <unk> friends -- all of these everyday acts of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s homo sapiens from the previous valley of existence .
in fact , this is a sensor that reads the electrical activity in my brain while i read this talk .
we made a lot of prototypes and products for life that you can control with thoughts , like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
this headset is wireless with an ipad or a smartphone .
how these children can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the physical and <unk> social <unk> turn around those people who are being diagnosed as different as being diagnosed with each other .
they understood the power of the human narrative and the value of the value that we &apos;re in humans changing , and it changes .
and she said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate it ? &quot;
my skill and my opportunity .
<unk> , and very unexpected , they gave them .
this <unk> didn &apos;t stop looking at my eyes .
i ran a track i know .
and very , very slowly .
i didn &apos;t really believe in myself , not really , not all the <unk> of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . i am .
what we &apos;ve done is exactly the same thing that the same activity , but in one of them , it &apos;s great , and at the others , with just a small change in the posture , feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to take place , which is about what level of control is what we have about our tax .
for <unk> percent of this money , you could have <unk> <unk> into the trains that wouldn &apos;t be the duration of the journey of the journey , but what the enjoyment and the potential for far more .
i &apos;m not asking for the full part of the one .
sometimes they &apos;re very , very long .
i think the danger in the world is that the field of economics is that the field of economics as a relational discipline of human psychology .
if the average answer was 50 to 60 percent .
it will tell you that they don &apos;t have themselves , nor others .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i had a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
in hyperscore , we &apos;ve actually had <unk> , actually very powerful effects in children around the world , and now for people every time .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful that forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> play that it &apos;s completely adapted in a way .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a <unk> .
there &apos;s actually the present time .
i have to write five pages on day writing , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you , the last time , the last time , is something that i <unk> with hal <unk> together , which was something that i presented with a <unk> project in a previous project .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about people affected , because when one of the faces smiles smiles , then the other face is <unk> .
this is one of the reasons that this is so much about what we call for western science , math and <unk> , in fact , in the first few centuries of our <unk> , <unk> and <unk> developed .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no <unk> .
so this is not surprising to you , if you talk about mental illness , you &apos;re likely to be stories of <unk> suffering , shame and discrimination in nearly all walks .
a little more than 30 years ago , the united nations came in the world in <unk> , and we had this <unk> explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
if you look at that profit , you can see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually <unk> .
and that was in the early <unk> , as india was going to be <unk> <unk> -- as a means to go -- after china with his <unk> growth of 8 , nine , 10 percent , and wondering , why can &apos;t we do that ?
it makes you not happy , but they have the confidence and the courage and the courage , &quot; that &apos;s what we calculated .
green carbon , so the emissions of deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon , is 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things are not , in fact , dick , and also not .
i also liked this intellectual <unk> .
and he said he &apos;d had the same relationship with his father &apos;s exact same relationship .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they &apos;re not moving in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color which is just fantastic <unk> .
many of these ideas are <unk> into the rift trailer of airstream .
if you think about it , your kids can make the tinkering school , they &apos;re going to become <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let them trust them under their own conditions and trust me , you know , they &apos;re learning from <unk> cannot learn .
if you want to throw a device , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all this is . this is the number . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife knee , four months after that , four months after , and in the good constitution .
how about it with a completely <unk> <unk> , not just sharing ?
this is one of the seven that <unk> that didn &apos;t get into all the shot .
and so it came out in the years of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to buy a thousands of , then hundreds of thousands and then finally millions of each other and then millions of each other and then millions of each of them .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as edison edison invented the light , it looked like this .
you &apos;ve got to be pretty smart , and even though i don &apos;t have a <unk> , doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid and in the world .
they &apos;re literally the door .
if you listen to the <unk> of your <unk> listening , both your ears are both <unk> .
we have the problem that <unk> antenna .
again , thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i drew their own special card for each person and wrote their name on it , <unk> and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you <unk> .
and i believe that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and limited life , so on this earth is exactly the <unk> .
in this mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about how nature make materials .
so we think about the future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the <unk> where they have different charges .
and through a sequence of <unk> , you can one of a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you &apos;re looking at <unk> .
if you ask people the question : where do you go when you do something important ?
i &apos;ve been on my desk on my desk , my <unk> computer .
so what happens -- sometimes you have those days that you wake up at eight o &apos;clock morning or when you get up , and you say , man , man , i don &apos;t really have good at night .
in the office , most of these are <unk> and distractions that people actually do work from work .
we all know that this is true . they never had a <unk> meeting that &apos;s an employee .
meetings and managers are now the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once the week , <unk> that week , no one week .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to take seven years and have no idea what the future will look like .
but if you ask people after the three most important things they carry on themselves -- no matter what culture , what gender and the context -- people say most people : key , money , and if you own one .
but this is a very big , but we have the tendency to forget the tendency .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of <unk> and then -- the owner of the store takes 10 or 20 percent of <unk> , and there &apos;s the rest of the amount of money on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he has kind of a tribute to the values of <unk> .
at the same time , with these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell you about it later .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares a new research research that shows how the <unk> of life will make a human lifestyles on genetic level , saying that if we live healthier , we eat better food cells , sports and more .
until i tell you who said it .
within that context , we can seem regret about many different things .
when i got home for night , after i had my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer to all , &quot; the answer to all , &quot; <unk> <unk> .
and i used to say earlier , i am a <unk> .
i thought i was going to try to make my ted wish to try to achieve what i &apos;m trying to do , and how this fits what you &apos;re trying to do .
not in india . now there are at least half a million .
and i came to the thought that anyone in this world had been thinking about the organization of the <unk> .
and so we set ourselves to do that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent who were treated the <unk> of their medications or <unk> in <unk> ways .
it &apos;s an attempt to make it , and i think it would be successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .

we need somebody who &apos;s coming and this .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords were still healthy and not poison . &quot;
then apple alex made out of the best voice i &apos;ve heard .
there was one reason that i was .
the <unk> is not natural .
but it &apos;s not about it .
at the beginning , the internet for me is a <unk> tool . now , it &apos;s something that i live for my real life , virtual life .
&quot; it &apos;s human , illness .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing test .
before i was an architect and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you living ? &quot;
we treated two <unk> pages as one side , because the reader is so true .
so what &apos;s the lesson ?
one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not flying .
it <unk> and terrible things happened to me .
everybody lost hope in my recovery .
so they went to their <unk> and all raised their <unk> furniture -- they gave me poison and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away the road is , and you don &apos;t know if they go straight straight , and you hear cars , and she had a terrible accident that they had done .
i thought that for some reason the time , and only for some reason , and it &apos;s only for family and friends .
for example , this is molecular structures .
he took me with the <unk> of <unk> .
can we argue all the symmetries in the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it because i built a little <unk> , right ?
if i got a magic train , and then you &apos;ll make a third train .
now , galois has a series of rules , like these tables , these symmetries , are interacting .
this is what we call <unk> .
instead of all <unk> , i want to know how many digits digits . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects , symmetrical objects , please .
first : poor diet , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison have been very <unk> in a software company today .
penicillin was discovered in 1928 , but even in fact , there were no commercial and <unk> useful .
it was the origin of <unk> that last year , the last year .
for me , the lesson from unintended consequences that <unk> is going to happen now . let &apos;s make it .
it works with every computer and it &apos;s the browser , minus , negative , minus and the text gets smaller .
they don &apos;t need to stop <unk> .
and so a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by giving me my real desk .
so a means that would be something like a <unk> , so that you will get back to the more traditional desktop . the things are on the grid .
now i get to get the heart of my music , and there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s a metaphor with bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re a little <unk> of contemporary mathematics -- not just <unk> , but mathematics is in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists on wall street , and i &apos;m one of them .
you can find them here : this is a book about flies , maybe maybe on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can be very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s really interesting .
go it . shake it up .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> without traffic lights , so with <unk> , save a lot of life , but there &apos;s an excess of them .
the answer is to allow cars to come from this side of the street .
warren buffet had done this : honestly to tell what &apos;s going to work , and what &apos;s going to do and do this .
in fact , we &apos;re going to see that the only thing is the only familiar disease is because of the living in africa , in fact , several things have been formed around the <unk> .

but that &apos;s not just a <unk> .
not just she was weak ; she &apos;s getting weaker .
a teacher of the top quartile is the performance of his class -- measured in <unk> -- in one year , 10 percent increase .
but it &apos;s not in any relation to a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free courses could not only be available in the internet , but you can also get <unk> to the internet , so everyone with access to a <unk> teacher can do the very best teachers .
traditional containers , like this cup , takes eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought he was a painter and he went to his school school in tibet .
when i look at these pictures , i <unk> the smoke on my clothes when i went home to my family home .
my parents responded great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s go tomorrow .
but is it so bad for us to do so powerful ?
this is an example in boston .
so the pathologist takes the sample , <unk> it , <unk> it , <unk> it under the microscope , and then you know the operating room .
so in that tissue tissue , this is a solution with these <unk> molecules , along with a dye , shown here in the <unk> of a cancer , that can &apos;t separate the molecules of the molecules .
with <unk> lymph node , as part of our world &apos;s <unk> , the surgeon after the individual node , the node where the cancer begins .
if nerves will be broken , they can cause the spinal cord , and pain .
if we <unk> these two specimens .
we know that this is feasible , and we &apos;re determined that .
and this cell is one of the thousand different types of <unk> that we &apos;re learning .
it will affect the healthy circuits in the same way , like the ones that they want to fix .
and one morning in the summer of 2004 , we have tried it , and it worked for the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that there &apos;s a short amount of extra cells of these cells to be <unk> .
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story of which we think it could find clinical application .
well , you can see that the animal can actually <unk> the walls and get into the little platform and its eyes can use .
buildings are packed with the air of the air , <unk> microbes that ripple through the windows and over mechanical <unk> .
and if they stop outside , the air is microbes that are associated with <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
obviously , i &apos;m a very strong person very powerful person , as you can see , so i didn &apos;t worry about this thing .
same is true for the question of the 11th of september the streets in my neighborhood .
and you can get a list .
one of these things that i &apos;m experimenting with is something called a google share , basically , you just take a abstract term and looking for google after you , and then you &apos;re looking at these results after the name of someone .
this is heresy . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second page here , you &apos;ll link a most .
what happened to us 40 years ago -- the story of stories between generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members of our members .

in california , they &apos;re <unk> with a <unk> : &quot; this product contains chemicals that &apos;s the state of california as cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a <unk> design that they need , and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s an accident that words &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; and &quot; the &quot; &quot; eternal &quot; button . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone minister didn &apos;t cut us because we have the stones . &quot;
and that &apos;s all the way for berlin , but we &apos;re <unk> <unk> in houston , and all the windows are closed , and all of the things that &apos;s obviously not for the use of function is actually a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
we &apos;ve got the 4,000 <unk> of the most frequently , the most common <unk> in a database that we &apos;re in six weeks of public public .
now , we have a hundred kilograms of some of the hard <unk> of the internet .
we started commercial and <unk> use of buildings so that all the people centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s not tell you , that we already knew all because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , if you give that the <unk> at microsoft / 11 , at the yahoo of september 11th , and then the others , google , facebook , skype , skype , apple and so on .
i &apos;ve chosen sweden , because sweden is similar to sweden , like the united states .
and whoever was telling them , he doesn &apos;t just hide long enough not long enough .
her email were read , and she was talking to the <unk> and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no matter of privacy , it can &apos;t give real freedom of freedom , so no sensible democracy . &quot;
a lot of people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; usually it looks like when you get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , these are the areas where they &apos;re going through .
and the thing of a particular cell is to basically <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that the 25,000 genes are turned on , and what are the threshold they turned on .
now , experts are going to play experts in the game and make a difference .
we take that , material , and put it on a so-called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genomes , and they &apos;re trying to find the <unk> with the genes .
whether this is the individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
we know how we can eliminate poverty , we need to do more for this ?
so here are a couple more questions .
how do you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
well , it was all the same .
and there were many experiments that all came to the same result , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one story .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to change the politics .
and maybe we start small , with things , where we &apos;re sure they are .
poverty is <unk> more than scientific work , and a lack of data about the effects of <unk> , the question of how to help them , but the lack of data on the effects of <unk> takes the question of how to help it .
so we &apos;re starting , because africa is , in some sense , in the deep terms .
and the legend is reported that alexander across the desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with over 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t be . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk about this from the perspective of <unk> .
in tanzania , last week of the standard <unk> <unk> .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was in 2005 , in 2005 , with the world &apos;s best performance in 2005 ? &quot;
because there &apos;s fascinating opportunities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey that we all want to be inspired to be inspired by the universe , which is life .
you get a switch on -- there &apos;s light light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought they thought .
i &apos;m going to run this way , so you can somehow describe my reactions when i saw the first time i saw that .
all right .
ok , all right , raise your right hand .
kt : yes .
kt : no , no . i look at the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again .
kb : how often they felt that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , in five , four , three , two , one .
first , if you want the pressure down , you &apos;re going to make a <unk> , so , but only if you want the pressure released .
do you want to do it ?
you know , you feel a certain sensation , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw it into the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , we have keith barry , how our brain can <unk> our bodies -- with a trick that works with <unk> , and then he <unk> the audience into a couple of <unk> brain brain brain .
<unk> .
this is not for &quot; one of four . &quot; that &apos;s all four .
i was observing that , both religious and <unk> people are equally <unk> .
the <unk> is almost zero to zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation for the <unk> .
you get the following message from the computer , &quot; that person one has sent this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin increases the <unk> , 80 percent rise to 80 percent .
i just found that .
he asked me again , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments , we have testosterone testosterone .
that tells us that we invented this ritual to us with this new little bit .
and it &apos;s very easy to <unk> your brain .
to take the device to run the device , you need a lot of people .
or shouldn &apos;t it ?
they answered pretty <unk> : &quot; you &apos;ve got a device that only in english works . so we have taught us english , so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
it &apos;s absurd . but i needed to follow the way .
what will tomorrow be tomorrow ?
we need to undo this imbalance , from danger .
i think there &apos;s exactly the focus here .
i &apos;ve had an incredible question -- &quot; when did the beginning of the world ? how do you end up ? &quot;
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i just lost the thread .
<unk> went to the local <unk> in uttar pradesh and found out that he was in the official &apos; 70s .
so this area is <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged layer of the privileged , which is able to pay several <unk> to pay several houses and several households , in common .
so after these four children , you see younger younger sister who are following their children who were killed .
and finally , it was a single thing that was <unk> to me and later his participation , and so i had to <unk> him , so he &apos;s got to <unk> him .
at the age of 16 , children have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t .
one of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of the naked hand in the instrument , and the technology , and of course , what he was talking about listening to our young people .
well , my career is going to be more .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him from the <unk> <unk> .
or we do this , and believe , this is what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
can i not do that , but why can &apos;t i do that when i learn a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> shows the dove <unk> evelyn <unk> , why listening to music much more powerful than sound sound to your eardrum .
and it &apos;s got so big , until the point where there &apos;s a <unk> last year ago at <unk> &apos;s thanksgiving <unk> and rick <unk> , and &quot; <unk> &quot; millions of people on tv .
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky that it &apos;s not going to transmit live to you .
peace and love mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you don &apos;t still know what you should .
this is 10 times more than the mammals needed to reach their maximum body size and all the habitats to conquer these habitats .
we &apos;re like , we &apos;re very similar to the dinosaurs , and we &apos;re unusual in our <unk> mindset .
basically , it &apos;s a country that has no <unk> at the beginning of our work .
this is an adult <unk> in his neck .
paul has never seen a fossil effect .
these are all <unk> . there are a number of possibilities .
i became an artist and started to draw .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been involved with this question for centuries -- how to do these children in science .
bad news for men , however -- some others have the same idea that the <unk> <unk> and paula radcliffe , paula radcliffe , which is a tremendously , and the fastest <unk> ever .
show me an animal with <unk> and <unk> , and it has something to do with water .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we &apos;re the biggest <unk> in the jungle .
now emily <unk> -- one of 500 <unk> and <unk> -- they end up looking at the pay place , under the best 10 , even though she has done on all the <unk> her baby -- and <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
stop focusing on the focus on these <unk> where you failed , if you need four hours .
at the time , it was always about to interact with things , not with things , not with people -- not in a social way , of course for us , and the people really would help us to accept robots as part of our everyday life .
cookie monster is very , very angry .
the <unk> was a <unk> from our group where they were three of three different technologies to interact with the people .
and with this technology , you can &apos;t be so active in the lives of your grandchildren , in ways it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third one was a simple diary with a piece of paper and pen , because that &apos;s the <unk> that you normally use when you get a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is this idea of <unk> <unk> &apos;s character .
i was a style , laugh , so that &apos;s real hard because it &apos;s not going to stop , but <unk> .
walk away , isn &apos;t far . i fire : &quot; bang ! &quot; the <unk> drops between two cars cars .
if he wrote on a <unk> , i was in front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and film , but i &apos;m also doing <unk> books , books and a bit of advertising .
from photography , this is <unk> , she &apos;s <unk> , she &apos;s <unk> . what you can &apos;t have , you want to .
as you move into the collective consciousness , without that we know that , and how this happens .
it &apos;s very expensive .
and then you turn the photo that it &apos;s going , and suddenly it &apos;s going to be quite serious and maybe less .
85 percent of the global disease is in cardiovascular disease -- not in the west , and yet , 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
easy to treat . look at the island in the island .
but if you tell them , we &apos;re going to try to make the same thing in nigeria , go all over .
it allows the existence of <unk> centers , and we can use the experience very smart .
we need to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
and we &apos;re starting to do a <unk> engineering program , so we local people who can fix this equipment .
so , autism has a very large amount of bandwidth , which is very powerful -- the child has evolved no language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
<unk> love i love the film , like they all <unk> my projects . this is the <unk> .
well , what i was early on , because i was so <unk> , my job is to sell my work and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a kind of equipment .
in the film , <unk> <unk> .
i made a <unk> during the trial , and i made things and also how to do things and also how to do work .
another very <unk> idea is that the kids are taking some of a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
tg : i have passion for the things that i do , the world will improve .
it &apos;s a distributed reality that can empower the projections and systems can , or just a digital storyteller .
and the fifth time i stand on this coast , the <unk> <unk> looks like i go out on the far edge , and i think again , that i &apos;m going to do it , all the way over the vast , dangerous wild one .
it was deeper , how much life is there ?
and then there is our <unk> that you never really said , how far it is , we know , how far it is .
but quite frankly , all these talks that i &apos;ve taken , just just to make the <unk> <unk> , they were very different .
thank you very much fun and much fun .
and this is maybe the <unk> , he lost his sense .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium is a lot of new ideas in circulation ?
they had to synchronize quickly claims what other philosophers knew . otherwise you couldn &apos;t have the right kind of discussion of discussion .
but there was a programmers who decided that this was not the best way of work .
every one of them can do changes and you can do it for <unk> work , even if you had nothing from the existence of the other before .
this is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing here .
something <unk> that can happen to be a culture of culture : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right now . right ?
don &apos;t try to do what others do , slightly better , because it doesn &apos;t do it very far .
and if you say somebody says you can &apos;t stop , you don &apos;t stop .
six to nine months at the average season .
but we &apos;ve got these rovers to test out of these rovers , before we <unk> them up there -- or this one rover -- and made sure that everything works .
so we have a probe on the way to mars , it &apos;s called phoenix . this probe , in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , you can make your watches .
and that would be bad .
so we &apos;re going to talk about as we &apos;re talking about , the next rover that we &apos;re sending to mars .
and i know many of you have the last time that these are really cool things .
there were two <unk> that were very interested in us .
it &apos;s like the <unk> on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water is frozen .
today i want to talk today about how these exponential technologies are .
so let &apos;s see how exponential growing affects health care .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there &apos;s been wireless <unk> .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us better with our patients and spend more time to focus on the importance of human elements , which is through this type of technology .
now the current trend is in medicine , but it &apos;s getting exponentially smaller .
let &apos;s go to genomics , when 10 years ago , the first human <unk> was done , was the cost of a billion dollars .
thanks to websites like <unk> like me , or how about your data on <unk> <unk> or google health , it becomes more important to use all of these possibilities in a <unk> way .
we used to use the cells from the bone marrow , to treat a patient with a heart attack , we found a improved <unk> and higher <unk> , using a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
their cats , god knows how many people who dress up on their <unk> , their <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
as you cross the <unk> tiles , at the level of <unk> to the street , <unk> , not look at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was scared , a <unk> part of me would be out of control , and i would be caught forever in the <unk> <unk> of her <unk> .
but i &apos;m afraid that <unk> comes from , and my spine .
if we love to love it all around me , i &apos;m not there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images who are paying attention to critical issues , images are the <unk> , images , images who are <unk> and doing something in other words .
in the &apos; 80s , the <unk> of the disease has been an enormous obstacle to debate about this disease , or not just mention .
jonathan klein : photos .
i had a lot of books read and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
i was able to see how i got the flag on the blade of the flag , you know ... aah , a <unk> moment , and the music went on to a <unk> .
finally , at the morning of the day , we got the <unk> , and we put the helicopter <unk> -- and we took the helicopter -- two helicopter at the <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> .
i knew that there was more open water bodies , and i had a <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i had something .
this was the view of my tent when i got this <unk> call .
and just from the air , i saw the big picture .
and they turned around , and they wanted to go back to shore , and all the five died on the <unk> .
and this was a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but a few days later , we thought we were working together with our students , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this <unk> didn &apos;t have in that condition ?
one day in <unk> <unk> miles off the coast of the coast of the pacific regions in one of the pacific regions of the pacific , saw 20 american <unk> her ship in the ocean .
but at a certain point , most of these , these visions are going to give up to the most of these visions .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more closely than others .
right now , fear is an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> in the everyday life , an opportunity to glimpse into the future , if there is time to influence .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them in every living in the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses , and now we see them , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because what we discovered is that people want to care , and people want to be informed -- they receive the <unk> through the internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as 22 to the row , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood .
you want a needle in a needle just like you to share a toothbrush with a toothbrush , even with somebody else .
so this is an overview of over hundreds of studies of all the <unk> animals in the united states , and these are the studies that are effective , that are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see this distorted images from africa .
now , i say , well , great <unk> .
ines is a <unk> on the streets . she &apos;s a girl with a tail .
she was 105 years old when i made this photograph .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo . here &apos;s a little <unk> .
we were at <unk> , texas , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mom just sat in the car .
let &apos;s try it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
originally , by the <unk> <unk> , which later the <unk> built , an instrument with <unk> body and <unk> where the sound comes .
well , it &apos;s easier to say .
we were not stupid : we put in about five feet , a piece of plywood .
as a <unk> new , i came to the thought , why can &apos;t you take the oldest <unk> of the oldest , the <unk> rhythms , and they combine the latest technique ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected as a community through a ethic .
it &apos;s important to something the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space that was god .
and in a relational universe , the only thing was possible for that somehow it evolved to be created .
and you can understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and giving and take a <unk> .
there &apos;s a couple of tedsters here in front of two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different planes .
and just everything there .
while five months he <unk> to experiment with a complete <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or <unk> reed or the chemical brothers who played all the place , they all had their own casa da musica logo .

we want to talk about &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and this is it : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful africans .
but most of all , they need to be productive in their lives , and a kind of productive environment is creating in our countries , so things can be done .
so we can connect that ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had had to crawl between the legs of these people , with my sister with my sister on my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything .
and i often see no african staff among them .
the question is now how we can pull away from all of this good will to us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> <unk> in nigeria .
and with this idea , artistic creativity is actually a <unk> product , i took this case to so that we can study them , right as we can actually investigate any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied since the &apos; 90s to study very complex .
i want to try to show this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control of the control here , play games .
how do you study a rap scientific ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that is involved in <unk> .
so i want to tell you the probabilities that we play , that &apos;s the math of the play and <unk> .
it &apos;s very time-consuming and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the mind for the whole time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , their facial expressions can be , of course , and intuitively used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise it was very fast , and without a <unk> , it &apos;s not possible , so kids die .
another statement of esther was that we respond when it &apos;s a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s creating the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your <unk> , a very cheap blue laser .
audience : aye .
but what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve got it all the time , we &apos;ve never done it , the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant <unk> house .
these <unk> that you see here is actually growing in a <unk> where from the outside of the sea and <unk> .
so , water is an important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth . &quot;
the idea is not perfected .
they don &apos;t enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
when it touches the water touches , you should hear the air .
as soon as we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a <unk> species , there could be a smaller genome ?
and at the time , we realized that once this worked , a real opportunity would be able to do , if we could bring the synthetic chromosome to the bacteria , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so hard is <unk> .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand it . &quot;
but in fact , we live in the northwest very close here at the actual idea of paradise of the paradise of the paradise of paradise , the 36 times as &quot; gardens , <unk> by running streams . &quot;
but the more you add more , the more it seems to be lost .
and these numbers never come before .
this is a nest of a <unk> colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been formed by a queen in the summer .
the <unk> -- this is supposed to be a mirror -- they &apos;re an interesting group . they &apos;re going to out early in the morning before the first group of foraging .
oddly enough , and interestingly , it looks like about half the ant doesn &apos;t do anything .
the nest maintenance workers take all the <unk> and bring them to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and <unk> them .
the <unk> , but somehow , not get out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments showing that the longer one ant &apos;s more likely to hold out the simple surface of their surface , and so the ants that are very different ways to make them different work differently .
they &apos;re looking at all the earth except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of the world is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
so it doesn &apos;t have anything .
i think i think where we can use the natural gas .
and when i was doing this , it cost natural gas dollars .
why don &apos;t you do that ?
so they were just 500 million .
it &apos;s never been <unk> , or something like that .
tbp : i &apos;ve lost 150 million , okay ?
some people have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . you know it &apos;s the world .
they &apos;re working in <unk> manhattan where you built the first <unk> .
there were six different colors of colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t have to wait , but then they had to wait to wait , but then they had to call the <unk> , for the third time , had to call it .
so i &apos;m going to sometimes use a more clinical language , and it &apos;s not going to be as warm as heart as other talks about compassion .
and here is the basic idea that <unk> good actions for people who are going to be <unk> .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or to my family , i <unk> a lot less less to the golden rule . okay .
so , the results are going on . this is a non-zero game .
every form of interdependence , <unk> , force one , humanity , humanity &apos;s humanity .
and you &apos;ll tell you the other thinking that they &apos;re not going to be respected , and they even want america , and they hate america .
most of the diseases of poverty , but in the case of cancer children , the children who died in the children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died , a child , but nothing changed .
because you simply don &apos;t get this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant <unk> would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cell cancer and that makes you a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that the right <unk> matrix , we put the cells inside , and lo and behold , in about four days , they were <unk> and on the right , what we have in a culture .
and of course , let &apos;s say , where we go ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
and we &apos;ve got a <unk> journalist that was caught in <unk> ; a young <unk> whose book was so many <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s so many <unk> <unk> <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new ways of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you &apos;ve got four good friends of one person whose personality enemy .
that &apos;s really bad . why is they so bad ?
i can lie to lie ; they were speaking , and then they were left .
they were told how big the chicken was , or said , the <unk> are like this , and so far from the hotel .
right there , two : right there . okay , glass , make a photograph .
also , you want to your eyes <unk> .
but it really has opened my eyes , how often i left myself from life , for example , social networks and so on , even though it wasn &apos;t really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful tape band of <unk> .
and every one that was <unk> , i ran .
at least for me , because if i just do the same thing , i &apos;m very boring , very boring . i &apos;m very fast .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know when i see myself .
are you going to be nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look so sweet .
anyway , i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s good , it &apos;s just that it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
if you have a long predictor , it &apos;s going to happen .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- where people are different races or <unk> <unk> , but as citizens can do all the same .
in egypt , i was discovered of course .
this was in london , in london , in yemen and in amsterdam an airplane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and symbols of the symbols of the democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty is the only factor , well , is this family &apos;s family &apos;s family <unk> saudi <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition of what happened to be a political destination , and that was to clean the leaders .
these are not going to be social interesting if they &apos;re technically bored .
he <unk> the boundaries of the individual networks and <unk> them .
and because of social networks , chinese students are in abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , or companies from the rest of the world in china , there were people around the world .
and finally , the chinese <unk> .
we &apos;re more in a media media landscape in the media globally , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but it &apos;s all <unk> , i &apos;m still going to take as much as i did it .
in my fourth <unk> , everest , a comet over the mountain . <unk> .
this view is the <unk> up here , the first 600 feet of the rise of base camp .
and that &apos;s in camp .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news news that beck was <unk> , some of the climbers had collapsed to the snow collapsed in the snow .
it &apos;s so clear to work up there , that i sometimes put syringes straight through the clothes .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can just <unk> how he did that .
and that &apos;s how he thought back into action .
these are sherpas , the <unk> .
and the fourth thing that makes it is to me , &quot; ideas that we need to participate . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by the way 60 years , we have entrepreneurs models , and they &apos;re not going to be a society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy to bring democracy , because they bring them ideas in the universal <unk> , parliament and power and so on .
the third thing is back to the cities .
the second is the <unk> that we have , which makes it hard so hard to create employment in companies that are 93 percent of the indian jobs in the <unk> area .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have a modern <unk> to try to make a modern <unk> . so you don &apos;t have the <unk> .
you have to be a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to vote even .
although some people didn &apos;t want to hear it at all the left , it was actually the revolution of the markets that the <unk> was <unk> . &quot;
they fear the masses .
so this is why this whole suite of mistrust between the <unk> and those who represent them .
<unk> .
each of these <unk> would be statistically , for two years after the <unk> .
david cameron loses 20 million pounds in a social social fund to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investment in social change
i work . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even if i called my friend called jack , i say , &quot; i salute you , jack . <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t figured it out there , my name is tom , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means that i &apos;ve just heard everything you &apos;ve just heard about , just and alone with my voice .
and lastly , with this one here , i can mean my <unk> <unk> , <unk> , etc .
our people had to test about 5,000 different <unk> to the right .
don &apos;t listen to those who you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right is a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> .
his wife said , &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
many of these patients are pulling the <unk> <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical .
it can immediately stop the operation and immediately stop .
<unk> street , i know .
and this is where they really <unk> a lot of their creative inspiration . so it &apos;s a industry that &apos;s going on both directions .
and that &apos;s why you want to go to the next trend and so quickly as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , just work within this aesthetics .
you need many of the lawyers and a lot of time in court , and the <unk> decided decided that it was much too expensive .
these are the two <unk> <unk> <unk> inside of the logic .
and i want to thank you to really thank <unk> <unk> really for this very <unk> presentation .
once brought me a boat to a <unk> , and i realized that the <unk> that i was supposed to meet .
i think this is one of the <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .

here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope that i can find these organisms , to help these organisms to pay attention to their remarkable <unk> , and my part to protect your <unk> longevity in the next future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , a hundred years ago , still , mobile phones , but they also make their own <unk> , like this , which is <unk> mexico in all the 31 states .
so what do you do that ?
what could terrorists do today , using the technology now ?
recently , the fbi was arrested in the u.s. , which was arrested to transport these <unk> drones to transport the united states .
and as we see here , we turn ourselves in .
now , the mortality is 70 percent when you hit it , but it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s going to be killed so many people who don &apos;t have <unk> the funeral , in the <unk> of <unk> juarez .
but on the other hand , i hear people , as you talk about fear , a certain <unk> .
and tragically she was in 1999 when she was working in colombia with <unk> <unk> , with the goal to preserve their culture and language , with two other colleagues of the farc who were raised and tortured and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more vulnerable for these kinds of <unk> than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for the people who are simple solutions , <unk> categories , <unk> categories , because we don &apos;t think of profit as an inconvenience .
but the whole community , all different <unk> , including the <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because when she says full of the juice , when she says full of the juice , she &apos;s green , they &apos;re feeding the world , it &apos;s enough to the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s take these three portraits .

england , america , japan , south africa .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion of oil on the earth today , and they &apos;re today today and nurtured .
now this might be the end of the story -- okay , we &apos;re using it all with conventional , renewable raw materials -- but i think that &apos;s where it &apos;s more .
similarly , material material that make it make itself , millions of abalone <unk> , all day , every day , every day .
and the idea was basically that i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of the great characters that come and i interview .
but i wanted interviews that were different .

they call this &quot; plan <unk> . &quot;
here it is .

in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , and we just work on the foot of the <unk> , which was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .

and one of the things that they found was they &apos;re not <unk> .
and this is our <unk> briquettes .
and it has the problem of the health effects of <unk> wood and charcoal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this is india , in this room just three of us have a car .

my theme is the food in schools , because this is about social justice .
and the next is <unk> .
people are talking about sustainability , but we should figure out what &apos;s going on .

europe had to be <unk> in the economic development .
now , the waste of raw resources is not all but , but many countries the bottom billion of the bottom billion .

and what &apos;s his natural enemy is what the means of the <unk> of the good is that we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not <unk> , but a <unk> insect insect <unk> , like , a quick and <unk> <unk> .
and if we <unk> this , for example , in a <unk> store , you go to the flowers .
in israel , for example , where we &apos;re at about 1,000 square miles -- this is 10,000 <unk> <unk> -- biological <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides , 75 percent of the pesticides .

right . so , this is the device that uses device .
there &apos;s a quality of sponges and precision that is just amazing and remarkable and remarkable .
so the first robot i &apos;m going to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s just being used to show that if you have cameras , or other sensors , because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter 80 , you can talk about <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
for example , in this case , even though the left and the right wheel with a single axis is connected to a single axis and so fast .

that global action is going to lead to climate change , like the fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i first learned these two things , <unk> me , this is very , both of a personal reasons for scientific reasons .
it has a very good <unk> <unk> , which is part of the united states , which was <unk> by thomas foundation .
after the treatment , we can make the child a series of simple <unk> a series of simple <unk> to see how his vision works .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to track these <unk> and hopefully quickly results .
and then i went from these <unk> to the <unk> of the music , and i thought , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i judgment , i think about how this is this .
but this was the fall of 95 and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s got aimee to the <unk> &apos; <unk> , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i was trying to anyone who could be , who could fight , who , who , so on , against whom am i am here ?
i had always won everything , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> big . just take it off . &quot;
so , aimee and the designer will be at ted <unk> 2 , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
they got somebody who came across and the shoes <unk> .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be the actual losses of the economy , unless we use math .
or to the <unk> jobs .
and another thing about mathematics : mathematics looks sometimes like math -- like this -- and sometimes you don &apos;t -- how &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math , we spend about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to step three of hand .
if people ask me , right ?
but the amount of automation in cars allow it to separate these things , so that is driving something else today than making a car and learning its <unk> .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do the same thing .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important to computers .
it was in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind since about a year .
i was thinking about my father , who had passed away from a <unk> <unk> on the brain .
likewise , as you can , just through the handle of the <unk> , which can <unk> the <unk> of the soil , and at the time , an idea of where you are , and what you &apos;re doing is what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was <unk> , and i was going to go broadway , i went to every corner .
if you design a city in the sense of the blind , there &apos;s lots of lots of jobs .
to give you a sense of that experience , &quot; i think , &quot; i think you &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous thing that i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next , is fertile and <unk> you ...
you give money for a good purpose and a good purpose to make emotional <unk> .
she &apos;s not a book that was written and the sky <unk> .
so this is what i &apos;ve seen is the key to me , is the key to me , to remember that in the way it &apos;s not <unk> , and i &apos;m not going across the stairs .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to the book , any meaning , we have to really , really , we need to be <unk> , and with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
so the academics thought that we thought this was a <unk> application , so we have <unk> models like this <unk> <unk> where the <unk> of a laser will become a <unk> on the laser of a <unk> .
alex was working on a little <unk> , a little bit , independent <unk> , called &quot; minority <unk> &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to make a sense that the interface will be used in the movie .
we have this <unk> operation because we yellow and <unk> on the green <unk> .
let &apos;s go apart : i &apos;m teaching it in <unk> .
we , as people , are the things that are design and we should make sure that our machines are helping us to help us and build on .
john , thank you for the science fiction .
what okolloh did was not possible for digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re going to change this .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and like all the <unk> , you get a leap of 20 years , if the interest in the audience changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so , changes and we started to play <unk> .
india didn &apos;t want to play with the <unk> .
the other was <unk> cricket .
it was the new india ? that was a different world where you could get away from all over the place for the best players .
we all had to see games in <unk> , but something we had never seen , <unk> <unk> brought the audience with a <unk> song -- for <unk> , not for india , but for <unk> .
could you imagine that this day ?
i hope i &apos;ve made each of you for a long time , and the game of the game , and hopefully there &apos;s a long time to work a long time working in this business .
and you know that the <unk> dogs is that because they &apos;re fast in memory , how often they frequently dogs and pigs on the leash .
why would anyone play in the world ?
on the other hand , if you can visit a country , and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your <unk> 20 dollars for a ticket ?
let me give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city of 100 is 100 to 100 , it is worth 100 <unk> value , completely matter , but people don &apos;t think of that .
now , in large , you &apos;re very impatient .
watch what happens when we <unk> <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more , so they say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean that he &apos;s a kind of mental mental mistake ?
there are no guns .
and so people are looking at economists as stupid people .
and the variation and variation is one of these <unk> that creates an intellectual activity , because you always compare the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words , &quot; in fact , there &apos;s the same rule as a new rule of being fantastic when it &apos;s too <unk> or too old .
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first of all -- my willingness to give me a critical audience , no one i &apos;m going to be safe .
it &apos;s my intention of the poster <unk> , shouldn &apos;t you understand it .
so , in large , we get them to survive .
jews often have a <unk> smell .
if the space was <unk> , we were able to see that people have more negative attitudes to <unk> men .
it &apos;s as if i was <unk> to talk about what i did in those 20 years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
no food became sick .
we don &apos;t need any more trouble going out .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea is that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that are so much psychological , or <unk> , and africa has to go to africa .
through the entire book , as an hour , more than an hour , <unk> and interactive animations .
what is the business deal ?
it was at least that you &apos;re always going to stay with you , wherever they always remain true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , this is a good idea . &quot;
they still talk about it .
when i came from college , i &apos;ve been working in southern southern california , and you <unk> around the spanish <unk> on the rooftops and things like that .
rsw : what ?
the <unk> -- they asked me for mit , and they took their technical <unk> to bilbao .
it &apos;s reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you <unk> for four months with three , the ideas are getting more and more and more living .
and one thing that i wanted to mention to i was to mention to my <unk> , but somehow , was , i was able to thank all the business that gave me .
but in the meantime , these things are about momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> and things are remarkable , and that &apos;s remarkable , and this is supposed to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i believe , five and the sixth is built here .
on this level , the 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer around the world will land in recycling .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of the advertising had an image of the brain .
and wish three is : <unk> . i was told myself to make myself a , and i always wanted to go into something like this .
and it &apos;s becoming more important that we figure out how to figure these raw materials from these very extremely complex .
the traditional ways of working material , it doesn &apos;t work for <unk> .
so the traditional way of making <unk> make it happen with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different types of <unk> and many different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , and again , again .
maybe we should study how to make monkeys economic decisions , how to make the monkeys economic decisions and figure out whether they do .
here &apos;s the highlight . it &apos;s going to be a token for food , and you &apos;re waiting for your food .
you &apos;re waiting for a little impatient that the market is open .
now , imagine that i give you a thousand <unk> dollars in your hands -- 10 hundred dollars a hundred dollars .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- so i throw a coin . you &apos;re going to be a coin .
if we made in our little <unk> , they would do the same stuff as people who are doing the same things as people ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people at the last level of development that makes stupid mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about <unk> , usually the most frequently stories are high stories .
we need to be less with concrete and steel , and we need to build more and we need to build more <unk> .
this is the same as much as we had 900 cars on the streets .
<unk> curtains <unk> my window .
maybe , &quot; citizen citizens , &quot; because recently she stood up to fight the decline of justice , the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely in russia , largely in the community of the russian government , now <unk> to employees and citizens in the development of innovation .
we &apos;ve heard talks about the people who have been hacked by the plants that have been hacked , and <unk> is working throughout the world , websites to create pages and videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother is always saying , &quot; are all the kids there ? &quot;
that &apos;s empathy .
he asked them a message , and they all read their own language in their own language <unk> , which is a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do is you don &apos;t want to you .
a pastor to his means to take this individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this by some <unk> .
there are over 180 messages in d.c. d.c.
it &apos;s going to run by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber .
there are also some constraints on its illumination .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i saw my aunt being raped when i was five .
one of the things that i witnessed when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t eat food , and we took the 400 .
as a kid , a young and <unk> , words i didn &apos;t forget , no forget .
this is my story , shared an artist .
my breakfast , my lunch , i was a foundation i started on a foundation that i founded , because we &apos;re building a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers .
audience : aye .
the third chapter is a <unk> <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are in favor .
we &apos;re going to solve this problem at the best , by the problem of death .
and even when it happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing of time when i was five years old .
santa was white , whether you weren &apos;t <unk> or not . right ?
but , julie , you were ready to school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense , that was the right answer , and then they asked them , &quot; believe that we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on earth ? &quot;
maybe your larger ability to cooperate to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the hardest glimpse of the modern times : &quot; the road . &quot;
in the world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it &apos;s going to be a basic contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now the good news !
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptics is the skeptics and the <unk> of climate change .
so we &apos;ve done a couple of years ago , a project for the <unk> did , a big program , it was meant that -- with lots of people -- a lot of experts -- a lot of experts were involved -- all of the experts in the world -- everything on the evidence .
one group , you know , it &apos;s going to spend it for yourself to spend on yourself and the other group of people .
and when they went from the first building for the second building , all the time went on a man who were humiliated and <unk> , and <unk> the question .
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; unclear &#93; stuff : the hidden life <unk> things .
and since -- it &apos;s been four decades ago -- i &apos;ve been working with the best in this area , in the world in this area , as young , young and old , created <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a rich web of art .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my passion .
i was dancing between <unk> and <unk> and excitement to him to my <unk> .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s how it was .
he put them together into something <unk> , and then he put them into this software that i think she had developed his son , and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little <unk> , little <unk> .
i &apos;d like to say -- yeah , make a beautiful website . how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make beautiful website ?
now , they ask the linked data that they now put them together . 32 hits that every one every one is a protein with these properties and you can see them .
and that &apos;s about linked data .
all this is going to have two million children in two million children , last year , as a year 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback feedback , feedback , and to give sure that the claims could really deliver results ?
you just show one of the numbers that 5,000 -- is that number ?
my brothers started to give me some pins and paint for the drawing .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been fascinated with this area .
how many of you have a cow about the street on the road in bangalore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained as people who are trained to reality , and that &apos;s what makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; all right .
can you not do something like anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from <unk> .
because when we see somebody , we see the footprint .
what percentage of them have foreign <unk> ?
obviously , he has the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually beautifully suited to the end here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve found that most of you , i &apos;ve heard about the economists of economists find assumption that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place that i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to have some technical technical .
think of toyota .
they can &apos;t be <unk> , so they accept it and find a way to work .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza will take you when they have hunger .
there &apos;s millions of different <unk> .
so , remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re in baseball .
it &apos;s the poet <unk> chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s how much percent of the day do you think about this person ? &quot;
in fact , people have <unk> <unk> of these people .
they came with <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it became really a powerful force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think that men are <unk> as women ? &quot;
there &apos;s no time on this planet that was the women so educated , so interesting .
she &apos;s 23 she did she was 13 .
i started to <unk> myself , why you &apos;re more likely to fall in love , than in the other .
they &apos;re going to be long as long as the human race is on what shakespeare is called &quot; the <unk> spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves , whether it could be that the resistance of the cause of death and disease disease -- at least most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our views would be wrong ?
my great , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of the ford motor company company to improve life and cars for every affordable affordable .
and the good news is that we now have the big problems of cars and environment , not just at ford , but in total ways .
i think you can imagine .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we will have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support this <unk> future .
this is a minute <unk> .
i think now , my mother , i think , is this kind of <unk> .
the nurses need to enter data .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on ?
well , it was great because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when a student was a student of <unk> , i met adults who were really interested in my ideas , <unk> and lots of <unk> <unk> with me .
now it &apos;s all about the children . so we don &apos;t <unk> .
so basically we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money that you give us to buy aids .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is that <unk> is cool .
in a way , in a way , in elegant , or a <unk> device here that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible art experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the <unk> of the country in the cities , for 200 years , has happened in the same process in 20 years .
it saw changes even though these were not supposed to be .
so let &apos;s put the models under an artificial sky .
i think one reduction in altitude from 94 percent for virtually .
and how do we do this in this sort of <unk> world , specifically in some places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , that &apos;s going to be 400 new years of airports .
and this is the focus of the <unk> talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in positive senses , which is healthy and our well-being , without reasonable darkness .
unlike the first office i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is an absolutely <unk> office , which is the <unk> .
behind you see the <unk> building that later became a icon of modern <unk> .
i find that what you &apos;re seeing here is quite puzzling -- how much light in the sky has evaporated and never the floor .
it &apos;s not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
if our <unk> <unk> , like a few weeks earlier , a war in a third of india , about 200 <unk> , about 200 <unk> , he &apos;s called the topic wrong .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was home at home , i saw a <unk> , or it came to me in the sense , i could be like a <unk> .
ag : but what is it going to be used ? what is it used ?
to do what ? to break stones .
this is the only place where they could express their creativity .
they don &apos;t want a second choice of standards and <unk> .
and that &apos;s what sheikh <unk> did made <unk> .
i had to my loved .
mr. <unk> , who lives with a physical challenge , only 50 inches big .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> billion people .
or skiing . it &apos;s just fun and people love to love it and fun things .
so we worked very , very hard , but we knew that it &apos;s not so hard to develop the technology of what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not designed to park next to a park ; it &apos;s wonderful <unk> to you to drive them between cities and forth , but think of that , we have all the problems in relation to range and speed .
so if we could do this box here , we could have a couple of years to transport this box , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package , which is 60 pounds ?
terrifying or explicitly , people who are dying , somehow in the drug that are involved in the drug that are involved in the drugs , or professional <unk> or even both .
in los zetas , as a result of psychopaths , fear and horror in cities , and the press press , and the press press , and it &apos;s also true for most of the time .
mexico and the u.s. , now , is a real international organization , the partnerships with the production of production in the south world and global employment in the global distribution .
but also part of it , a month of <unk> magazine -- you live in the future , and we have a long <unk> .
and after it falls under a critical price , it tends to be successful if they &apos;re successful about a critical mass of <unk> , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and you can see the interesting thing . if you &apos;re cheap , you lose the brands , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , you &apos;ll win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open to &quot; is really , you know , the gift of the silicon valley of the world .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital is working in between and trying to take it out .
to the second , it had to be extremely cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers of the world had access to a technology that it has enabled us to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties of men and women through all generations .
you remember , while the <unk> reported in his blog , over the <unk> and <unk> it often -- it was just possible , because it &apos;s blogs .
i love music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin , and i said , i can .
i wrote this post , and i did this for einstein today .
and you see this .
these little things .
and i think maybe i have to <unk> , because i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it has been sustainable <unk> , except from our generation .
we need to use this approach to use a better understanding of how the oceans works .
we studied these fish . but first , we had to learn how we have to hold them .
but it &apos;s just half the biggest tuna that we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . it could be sex under -- and there &apos;s it .
you can -- you can -- it &apos;s a seal -- it &apos;s <unk> like a seal -- and a white shark will go on it , a <unk> creature .
and then we give us these animals even one encore .
and the white shark .
i don &apos;t think he didn &apos;t know that the records of my <unk> <unk> .
they said , &quot; apart from that we have talked to the groups of people who want to harm the u.s. damage ? &quot;
you don &apos;t need to waste your energy waste .
now , who &apos;s looking at my <unk> , and i know that i was there , and i know that i would have a ninth of dollars for $ <unk> in the morning .
all few moments , i <unk> a <unk> on my life .
when i started to the project , people have said , &quot; why would you want to tell everybody what you do and where you &apos;re ?
now it &apos;s quite normal .
now , look at these <unk> of paris to see how incredibly fast growth is .
i looked at thousands of these <unk> , trust and trust and efficiency .
how <unk> we went to face how trust face is built by face ?
i was a mind in the system .
this page comes up with a day , <unk> , 80 percent of them get a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality i showed you that i &apos;m going back to again .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second <unk> , even with the 50 american states -- the same question : the more unequal countries are all at all of this scales ?
with a devastating effects , what &apos;s going to use the benefits of the population .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same as opposed .
the social judgment , the fear of these guys , and fear of these guys .
or for instance , for instance , why violence is in more more societies in more societies , is because people are squeamish .
a year , more than three million <unk> a year , a new knee or a <unk> .
you remember how kamal was before the <unk> .
if you wear it under a rock or a <unk> , or a <unk> , it &apos;s very clear that they &apos;re wearing a prosthetic , and in societies , in which disability is very sensitive , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i have even bought the <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a little piece of paper that says , &quot; don &apos;t use this <unk> to <unk> juice .
so this is the result one to 20 20 to 20 , &quot; google just so many , &quot; o , so many pages are .
strong fear is <unk> .
if you were always in that condition , it would never be done , because you would like to say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to make it . &quot;
almost all we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about to be safe in this world .
if it was <unk> , and it would fall apart , and it would never fly apart .
it &apos;s a very small piece of paper -- you &apos;re not supposed to do it .
so i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that would look at me like an alternative education .
and the evening of this day <unk> 70 children .
so i could even choose to pick up a cross-section , to a cross-section , which is part of the world .
and what you see is obviously a child is operating the computer .
natural systems are all <unk> : galaxies , molecules , cells , cells , organisms , societies , besides the theory of the intelligent designers .
and it &apos;s about the <unk> of idealism in this whole <unk> .
i bought a nice suit and i was wearing a nice suit , and i got this remarkable thing i had to <unk> .
but in 2002 , when my tour went to the end , i decided i didn &apos;t want to go back in london .
i felt that was destroyed something .
and i went through . i went through these numbers .
and i was traveling in kosovo and <unk> .
independent diplomat is part of the world &apos;s part of a trends that comes out of the world , obviously , and shows that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re affected these people who are actually affected .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in a certain sense , independent diplomat will be these <unk> , these changes that happen to us .
&quot; hey , could you get to me ? &quot;
because if we go back to the <unk> , they understood that an easy mistake can tell you that one simple mistake can tell you , or to remember why you love something .
we feel awe , mercy .
go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , there were the <unk> show , &quot; the <unk> show &quot; that , &quot; in 1973 , in the top 10 , followed by &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; three angels . &quot;
i can choose them from the island .
and i &apos;m looking forward to talk about it with you , i &apos;m going to come in and say , &quot; can somebody tell me the question , and why it &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
next is making this <unk> stuff that the <unk> <unk> .
for a series of reasons .
or even worse , education is always worse , more like the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have so much work in front of us and if there &apos;s a person in science , i &apos;m going to ask you to join me .
we go up the stairs and learn a state of consciousness .
so many books say the same thing , which is that there &apos;s nothing that people are so much together like war .
durkheim believed that all the things that surround us is to think of success .
he said that &quot; <unk> and <unk> people don &apos;t get together and without <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it uses the other .
once they were all in the same tribe , they were able to keep the benefits of cooperation .
it &apos;s about to connect with others to connect ethical ideas .
jh : thank you .
so quickly , i realized that <unk> isn &apos;t just going to be inside .
and right next to the garage , he has his own <unk> , where he can degrade his <unk> , which is another important role in <unk> play .
everything is easier to be in design , and here &apos;s this <unk> , and , my god , i just photographed it .
&quot; the end of <unk> is going to printed this for the fifth time .
this book is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; it &apos;s another word for quotes .
this is actually an experiment for a client , <unk> , where we made a sequence from six pictures and tried to get people through the print medium .

so this helped us make a very ethical and very strong organization organization and a system that supports them .
we have a simple digital camera in a <unk> <unk> and making a <unk> through a doctor for every patient .
well , we &apos;re going to rely on a lot of what makes us healthy profits , which makes us a healthy profit , and that although we treat a lot of people .
that &apos;s a hard job .
for example , we can make digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t it be an opportunity to design cell phones ?
it was like they couldn &apos;t see me more , as if i was invisible .

like bp &apos;s going on the hole at least , at least , but not without an enormous prize .
don &apos;t be ashamed .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it &apos;s the wealth of this country that &apos;s created our <unk> system , a system that can &apos;t survive without <unk> growth and pets can survive .

but it &apos;s not a normal movie .
now , if i look at the base of a base , a base of this screen with the resolution of <unk> is distributed 800 to <unk> a glimpse of the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so he sequenced the genomes of his children .
it &apos;s because it would be somebody in the audience who wanted to stop .
imagine being released in 2016 , the foremost , not only four years <unk> tax revenues , but also their personal genome .
and so , i &apos;m going to ask you all the way to the <unk> and the genomic revolution that around them .
and we have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is inside of the <unk> portion of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the hip is moving along .
hopefully it &apos;s going to allow us to see this technology to see more more this survivors .
so on the branch of what the sample is , you get a switch off of gas and <unk> <unk> .
so it &apos;s exciting . it can be the <unk> of the used to be able to create some kind of <unk> , so we &apos;re going to capture some new particles .
the most famous batch is the electrical .

and we heard from the story , from the human tree by genetic <unk> .
in <unk> , we find many , many examples of compassion , for love and real altruism .
most important , i think , is it , with small groups of women , you give them the opportunity to give you the shot of <unk> .
and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
take the <unk> for all the problems that we have in the planet , in terms of the environment and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
and classic pregnancies and things like similar things , which young people prefer to hear better than adults .

working with the plastic , for example , after the first eight years , some of my pieces started to <unk> some of my pieces .
recycling . each one is about his book about <unk> ecology with the idea of recycling .
so i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m concerned about our youngest and far successful trial that is in the development of development .
the author of the book is juan , it &apos;s juan , it &apos;s done by the way , by the way , by <unk> .
at that time , we knew that one was a political thing .
over 15 years old , i lost a child , a second one , when i was 16 .
i know what it means to suffer , and if a crime happens , one person should be <unk> and punished . &quot;
but what if that doesn &apos;t happen ?
after a few years , i thought , but finally this is from the <unk> <unk> .

it reminds me of my college time .
and the research shows that these years are devoid of chronic diseases , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
they have what we want .
we &apos;re currently in half .
and for a while , we looked at the <unk> <unk> in order to see where there &apos;s a high percentage of <unk> .
instead , they &apos;re going to talk about the next trip in nature , <unk> recipes , and yes , they pray .
it &apos;s actually managed to do it by nine .
they tend to feed them <unk> .
for the little example , i think that &apos;s in the hand , we have a <unk> , which is <unk> on my skin , by making this light light .
so , they were amateurs , not experts , the inventor and <unk> of things like mountain mountain <unk> , <unk> , computer computer airplanes .
at the time , computers were also interested in computers , and no one was interested in it , and no one &apos;s ever dreamed of being dreamed of it .
you just have your eyes to be there .
i mean that he was seen .
this is what we did the driver &apos;s <unk> and studied .

the challenge for the <unk> player is , if he believes , the other is fair , or that it is to be a little commandments , so he thinks that only one or two dollars .
now , i imagine a couple of relatives .
we can try it . maybe we &apos;ll do that .
so what do we learn today ?
about 10 calories , you need to take a fresh food that we consume in the west .
so how do you get a city like this ?
and in the east , the city of the east , in <unk> , for sale for sale . that &apos;s why it &apos;s <unk> .

in the present , we have <unk> <unk> -- two hundred years &#91; <unk> &#93; , half a million parts , quite complex , new and exciting technologies of steel , concrete , glass , glass .
so the next project is that in question , the passive nature or the passive nature or the passive attempt to make <unk> <unk> .
basically , you have a chain of elements .
when i was in <unk> , wisconsin , i gave a public lecture to a group of students in school .
often , we &apos;re looking for <unk> diseases like for example .
it &apos;s unknown all over us , and it &apos;s just to be detected .
could we take off the lights off so we can see it ?
so we &apos;re chemical <unk> that are different . our kind of chemical <unk> has universality .
but there &apos;s no way i have to say , and i ask him , richard , richard -- i think we could come up with biological <unk> <unk> , and i think we &apos;ve got a few hundred million years ago .
now everybody &apos;s talking about services is a reduction in order to get a reduction of <unk> .
and he realized that it &apos;s possible to make various laws that the economy of the economy will enable little profits to win so much more clients .

to one of these zones to hong kong , there is shenzhen .
people can come to the charter of the charter , but no one is forced .

how would we write an agreement ?
you know , in genomics , a little bit more than 10 years ago , you &apos;ve sequenced that year between three and five genomes , there are already hundreds of hundreds .
if there are lots of chlorophyll , they &apos;re very much green light .
the number of shared genes , a little bit , if we ignored a <unk> parasites , it &apos;s got bigger , if we were focusing on certain genes of genes , on about <unk> .
it would be <unk> by the radiation , through the order of its chromosomes into small bits , within 12 hours , again .
let me end with ethical and political research .

people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our rational and <unk> thoughts and <unk> thoughts .
these are the same three things , so let &apos;s look at them .
and if you talk about what you believe , they &apos;re going to be the <unk> , what they believe .
so the reason that people would bought an iphone in the first six hours , for six hours in the row , was your worldview , and her will everyone you see . they were the first .

it &apos;s a real danger nowadays across the world , but this is in the indian ocean .
and we caught it with this <unk> . on board , six tons of cocaine .

this looks like a happy story .
what you &apos;re doing here -- you &apos;re going to live in what &apos;s going to live in your daily .
it &apos;s about food .
it &apos;s a horrific concept of developing the developing world that &apos;s been <unk> , argentina and <unk> 50 years ago , and argues that there was worse .
governance , a functioning government -- that was california from california from <unk> .

i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very much .
because we continue to move beyond the current climate and further off the current climate .
not just how we do it better , but what are the risks and side effects ?
