you know , one of the big <unk> in the way , in the travels and a <unk> research is research , in common with the people who remember the old days , the <unk> stones , they can taste the past , they <unk> stones in the <unk> of the plant .
just knowing that still <unk> beyond the milky way or beyond the importance of the oldest of the oldest of the world &apos;s oldest still important , or that in the himalayas , the fetus still understands the breath of the <unk> , meaning to memory , which is the actual thing that the world is that we live in , and only a model of reality , and only as a model of reality .
and of course we &apos;re sharing the same thing .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we &apos;re going through <unk> .
we need to be able to look at the <unk> of death through the death of death and so we shouldn &apos;t be surprised that we all sing and dancing and art .
but interestingly , the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> in the woods of the woods , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , or even a <unk> on the <unk> of the world , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of the guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , just with hope .
together , the <unk> cultures form a net from <unk> and <unk> life that the earth &apos;s <unk> and the earth &apos;s probably important to the earth &apos;s as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine that this cultural <unk> as a <unk> is , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> that by the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness , and the <unk> of the human imagination has been defined since the beginnings of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humankind .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of the things we are and what we &apos;re as is an amazing species .
and as the biosphere was so much more <unk> , this is what happens to the <unk> -- just with higher speed .
no biologist would say to the fact that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extinction before extinction before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the area of the biological diversity -- hardly that , what &apos;s happening as a <unk> <unk> on the area of the cultural diversity .
and the key thing that is happening is the extinction of languages .
so , as any of you born in this room , you were born on the world , on the planet , talked about 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
she &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture is access to the material world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a point that a point , an ecosystem spiritual opportunities .
and by these 6,000 languages , as we &apos;re in monterey , in monterey , that &apos;s where we &apos;re in monterey , which is not a half .
they &apos;re not taught to be more taught . that &apos;s what &apos;s called if nothing is done , you know .
what could be lonely lonely than being the silent <unk> to be <unk> one of the last of the people who are talking about , no way to have no opportunity to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of the children &apos;s going to expect ?
and yet , this terrible thing is actually someone somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because of all two weeks , she died a elderly person and a older language with himself to the grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not better that ? &quot; if we all talk about a better place , if we all talk about language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language . &quot;
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would see how it would be if you could not talk to your own language .
so i want you to a kind of trip today to a trip through the <unk> , a short journey of the <unk> to try to make them understand what has lost lost .
now , there &apos;s some of us who i forgot in the way that i say , &quot; different ways of being the one , &quot; really different ways of my father &apos;s being my own .
take a take for example of this child &apos;s northwest , in the northwest of the amazon , the people who are the <unk> of the east <unk> from the east , from holy snakes <unk> .
this is a <unk> people who are not <unk> between colors blue and green , because the <unk> forest is that people are being dependent on .
they have a strange language and a <unk> state called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry somebody who &apos;s a different language .
all this <unk> in the <unk> past . the strange thing that big houses are about , in which the <unk> six or seven languages are spoken to you , but you never hear somebody who &apos;s language .
you just hear and start to talk to you .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever been in , the <unk> <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first year was <unk> <unk> .
in 1957 , five <unk> touch contact with five <unk> , and made a <unk> mistake .
they took pictures of the air of the air , what we consider as a friendly gesture , and what forgot that they consider that these people have made of the rainforest in their life , in their life , had never seen something <unk> .
they took these photographs from the forest forest , trying to see the face or the character , and they didn &apos;t find anything and <unk> that this business was killing and killing five <unk> with the <unk> .
but the <unk> , not just the <unk> , and not just watch the <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths were happening in the deaths of <unk> .
we took the eight generations eight generations back and found two of a natural death of death and when we were people with a <unk> and <unk> , they were used to one of the people that died in his age , and we killed him with the <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their <unk> could smell the urine of a animal from the animal , and what &apos;s animal species of being this was .
in the early 1930s , i got an amazing assignment when i was my professor at harvard , i asked if i was interested in haiti and the secret societies that were used to go to haiti and the secret societies that were used to make <unk> .
so to make that <unk> , i had to think about this remarkable belief of the <unk> , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic and <unk> it is not a cult of the black magic .
the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i was asked you to ask the great world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , or whatever .
a continent is always out , out of the essence of the guess that there is no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course , there was a and <unk> of this very profound religious thought that &apos;s the tragic diaspora of the <unk> <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting about this is how interesting , is these living relationship between the living and the dead dead .
the living in the living will give the ghosts .
the ghosts can be <unk> by the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to fall in the rhythm of the living , so that the <unk> for a brief <unk> moment is a god &apos;s very short <unk> moment .
<unk> people say the <unk> love , &quot; you know white is in the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taking off of the mind , how do you get damage to you ?
you see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> coal charcoal , an amazing component of the ability to influence the body that this is <unk> when it is in a state of extreme arousal .
well , all the people i met was the <unk> from the sierra sierra <unk> de <unk> in the <unk> , most extraordinary .
now , the ancient <unk> civilization of colombia &apos;s <unk> and in the aftermath of the conquest , the <unk> pulled into a <unk> <unk> giant <unk> giant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people who never had been pulled by the <unk> of the <unk> .
until the day , it will be supported by a ritual priesthood , but the training is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> are at the age of three and four years from their family , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> on the <unk> world of darkness in <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the glacier for 18 years , they &apos;re now <unk> in the lap of the great mother .
and while all of those time , they &apos;re culturally culturally the values of their society , values that make the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , <unk> will happen to take one day of a sudden , and for the first time in her life , at age of 18 , you see a stroke , and in this <unk> moment , you see a <unk> , and in this <unk> moment , the sun begins the same beautiful landscape , and the priest <unk> , and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . it &apos;s to protect you . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this is the level of intuition .
whenever we think about a native and a landscape , we <unk> <unk> and the old <unk> of the <unk> and the old <unk> of the <unk> , which is a <unk> thought , or the other , these people are more connected to nature than we &apos;re connected .
so , in order , it &apos;s not <unk> , nor are the <unk> of the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter much place in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or cold <unk> of tibet , but they still have been , through time and ritual , and ritual &apos;s <unk> <unk> of the earth , which is not the idea , you know , that earth can be only because you &apos;re in consciousness .
now , what does this mean ?
it means that a little kid of the <unk> <unk> that is a <unk> in which the mountain is a <unk> , who will determine a very different person , and a different relationship will determine a very different person , and a little relationship with this resource that can be able to be able to recover .
if it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a pile of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the individual and nature is defined .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and believed that these forests are being there are <unk> .
this was made me to another person as my friends under the <unk> who believe that these forests are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> ghosts and the <unk> ghosts , the world &apos;s <unk> , ghosts , which they were involved in their <unk> of the world , ghosts that they were involved in their <unk> .
well , if you start to look at the idea of the idea that these cultures can create different ideas , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph that i &apos;ve been doing since the last april of the amazon in the amazon amazon .
this is <unk> , from the many of you , the most powerful <unk> of <unk> are <unk> from the repertoire of the <unk> .
so what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> potential , but it &apos;s actually made it really made out of two different sources of the one on the family on a side , there &apos;s this wooden <unk> that &apos;s a series of <unk> smoke on her consciousness , and it &apos;s about as if a blue <unk> smoke from the family <unk> .
this plant contains some very powerful <unk> of serotonin , and <unk> , and <unk> very much .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , you &apos;ve seen this stuff like this stuff , these substance that they &apos;re creating in different ways of creating <unk> .
this powder is about how to shoot like a <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have to richard richard evan , richard evan , who was the man <unk> with the discovery of the magical mushroom in mexico in the 1930s , and i said , i was discussing this <unk> <unk> , because at the moment , i argued that you could not be able to experience this <unk> .
but the thing that &apos;s been with is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because they &apos;re through a human gut , of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be taken with some other chemicals in conjunction with some other chemicals that the mao <unk> .
now , the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> are actually <unk> of the way that &apos;s needed to <unk> the <unk> . so , you know , so .
how can these people from a <unk> of 80,000 species <unk> plants that are not these two <unk> plants that are combined when they combine to combine a kind of <unk> version of the time , so that &apos;s the whole sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which is something that &apos;s meaningless .
but you say the indians say they &apos;re talking to us , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 variations on the <unk> that they &apos;re all at the very large distance in the forest that are going to be a kind of <unk> .
and then you ask them , as they were like their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re using some plants .
i mean , you know nothing at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that you have every one of the 17 varieties of <unk> and they sing them to one different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
now , the <unk> problem is that even those who are the sympathy of the very difficult position of the very difficult position of native to the very <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s sort of the past , while the real world , that &apos;s what is , what &apos;s the world .
so , in fact , you know , the twentieth century , in 300 years , in 300 years , is not going to remember his wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era we were in the world and the cultural destruction , and the problem is either actively supported .
all cultures have always involved in the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> stopped hearing less on the sioux , when they took a bow and the arrow of the time , as americans as americans would be , they stopped as they would be americans and <unk> .
not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> , it &apos;s power . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and you can see in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the doom , these are vibrant peoples that are <unk> by intermolecular forces that existence by <unk> forces that existence by <unk> forces that existence by <unk> forces that they &apos;re <unk> on the edge of a generation in the forest , and now it seems to be <unk> during southeast <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to be a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of the political view .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction , is <unk> extinction by human general , but the <unk> that &apos;s not <unk> the destruction of the people , not just <unk> , but generally , as part of a <unk> .
and they can &apos;t understand the suffering doesn &apos;t understand if you haven &apos;t seen it at the <unk> level .
i went to a young colleague of colleagues 6,000 miles from <unk> <unk> through <unk> <unk> through <unk> after the age of the statistics of those , 6,000 holy , and first when i came after the youngster of the statistics of those , 6,000 holy , ashes in the cultural <unk> of the <unk> were killed .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as followers in the <unk> .
that meant that he was <unk> during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled with her holiness the diaspora , people brought to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- for instance , for the crime .
he was being in the age of two years in the prison to hide yourself under her <unk> , she could hide it without life .
the nurse , who did this brave <unk> , was <unk> into a <unk> .
one day she came out of a <unk> <unk> and for these <unk> to them for seven years in a tough way to do it for seven years .
the suffering is being <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of the people &apos;s mind is something <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really about a choice , and we want to be in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> : the great anthropologist , she said that it &apos;s her greatest fear that we , as we , in the way of a thread , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , not just the whole range of human imagination on a <unk> way to see that there were no other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been for 600,000 years for 600,000 .
the <unk> revolution that we brought to agriculture , and we now have the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> through the 19th of priesthood and hierarchy and <unk> and surplus created -- just 10,000 years ago , only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world is like we know about it &apos;s almost 300 years old .
well , the shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we face in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these broader <unk> to the meaning of the human being , answers to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be the possibility of being <unk> , which is : people with the other minds that are the importance of all people and gardens a space can be <unk> . and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took the north end of the <unk> column when i went to <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and this man , <unk> , telling me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> years of our rule of <unk> , forced to be able to move to settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to be .
the family who was scared about his life , he took all the guns and all the tools .
now you need to know that the inuit don &apos;t fear before the cold , they used to her . they used them to be in their advantage .
the <unk> of all of the <unk> were originally made of fish that were made in <unk> .
the grandfather of the man didn &apos;t know about the arctic night or the white storm .
he <unk> out , took his pants out of <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and when the feces started cold , he formed it in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> the pages of the <unk> and the side of the <unk> and it was completely cold , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , took a skeleton of his dog and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> another dog and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> .
so you can do anything .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit of the world and all the native to the world .
the canadian government there was the inuit in 1999 , 1999 , in 1999 , the whole control of the california back to california , which is larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and is called <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> area . you control all the <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the <unk> can take with its people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious to the ones of us who are traveling to these distant goals of the earth , to see that they &apos;re not going to be away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that &apos;s in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do is that politicians will never achieve anything .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not a compelling persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we are probably the best institution for storytelling in the world .
156 nations sending our <unk> .
we &apos;ve read our magazines from millions .
and we &apos;re a series of trips to the <unk> of the <unk> that we take in places of such cultural wonder that they &apos;re going to take off of the course of <unk> , and hopefully , they will be one of the other the greatest revelation of the telecommunications , which is that the world has been made in different ways to create a <unk> <unk> in a really multicultural world .
thank you .
so what i first do is as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we microsoft as part of a woman &apos;s a woman in front of a woman &apos;s just a year , <unk> , that &apos;s where you can either local or fly with enormous amounts of visual data .
we see lots of , many of the <unk> photographs of the digital photographs that you can seamlessly and see the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , in a way .
and it &apos;s not like how many information we think we &apos;re looking at how big these are the collections of pictures or how big .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this is an example of a scan of the <unk> and it &apos;s in a field of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance can be like as that is the power of a system like that , the number of panels on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can actually do something like that , we can really show that this is a real representation of <unk> and not picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of a real <unk> of a magazine or a newspaper to read about a newspaper , which is a kind of medium at a number of scale .
we also have something that special edition of the guardian did .
we have a fake display with very high resolution of the <unk> that much higher than the <unk> display , and we have added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical intervention .
and this is really taking these ideas to make these limitations on the existing place on the screen .
we hope that this is not going to be <unk> and other rubbish , that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is a really obvious application of a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be doing this area .
but these are all the streets in the u.s.
<unk> on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get something else to get something else .
now this is even live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies .
one is <unk> and the other one is a very good research about <unk> , the <unk> of noah , a <unk> university of washington , under the advice of steve <unk> on the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> by microsoft research became done . a very good collaboration .
so this is the internet on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that if we create this kind of view where we can , through images , and this experience of the <unk> &apos;s resolution .
but the spatial structure is the images that &apos;s actually important .
the <unk> took these pictures together , so they took the real space that these shots that were made all around nearby <unk> in the canadian canadian expressway , you see , you see , the elements of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> and those things were going on in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are what &apos;s much more <unk> .
i would like to show you a <unk> <unk> of noah to show and this is from a early prototype of the <unk> on the first time to show you what i think is that it really is the kind of trajectory that &apos;s the technology behind this technology , the <unk> is .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so worry .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral of the cathedral , lady in computer with pictures of flickr just flickr just put a <unk> lady in flickr and you &apos;ll just get pictures of the men in t-shirts and on the <unk> and on and on the <unk> . each of this orange <unk> was represented here .
so this is all the <unk> , and they all have in the same way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i didn &apos;t believe that i &apos;m going to work to microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception .
and i guess you can see that these many different types of cameras are : everything is that the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of you , all of them in that environment .
and if i can find some of the weird things .
many of them are covered by faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of notre dame &apos;s lady that was right .
we can think of the poster at a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now data of all gathered -- from all over the collective memory of it , like visual memory -- and everything is going to be connected .
all these pictures are connected to each other , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that &apos;s coming out of all the earth .
consider this as the sequel of work by stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s about complexity that people use it , grows and use its use for the users of it .
their own photos will be used by the metadata of the metadata that another person has been .
if someone has done the trouble and all these holy and you tell these holy and you tell who they &apos;re all , then my photograph of the <unk> <unk> of all of all this data , and i can use it as a starting to dive into this room , in these <unk> , the photos of the <unk> of the brain .
and of course , <unk> all the major virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just been through or images and satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
i understand them right ? it allows you to make it , at a certain point , within a certain point , within all of the next years , all the images that are being used by in the world are being used to compete ?
yeah . it &apos;s not making anything else .
if you want to make them <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of information that &apos;s thinking of information that &apos;s a lot of these pictures .
like , if you could do a <unk> for pictures where you can draw sentences and the text of the website , a lot of information that &apos;s picture .
but what if you &apos;re like the picture to all your images ?
then the volume of the <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that makes it really is , it &apos;s enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
so , <unk> , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , i hope , in the <unk> with other things you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you &apos;re not at these few connections , if you &apos;re not .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what &apos;s the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies in all western societies .
the official <unk> works like this : if our goal is to maximize the good position of our citizens , is this particularly through the <unk> of the freedom of the one .
the reason that is that freedom is good in itself , is valuable , good , a <unk> of reasoning for the human .
if people have freedom , then everyone of us are concerned for themselves to do things that we have and nobody &apos;s going to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices have people , the more freedom they have , the more freedom they have , the more common they have to do , the more common .
this is , i think so deep in our water supply that there &apos;s no no sense of question to question .
and it &apos;s also <unk> in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress is that modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to briefly say something about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket when they don &apos;t stop the 10 and 12 <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that they could buy a large number of <unk> in the store , in which unlikely is not the wrong case for them .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then she goes to the <unk> store for a stereo -- a stereo , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in this one laptop , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can put <unk> millions of different <unk> facilities , put out of the components that are offered to be an business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there was a phone on the phone , you could have the phone on the phone , as long as he came from my desk .
they &apos;re fired her phone . they don &apos;t bought it .
and one episode that the phone was never broken .
those days are over .
we have an infinite selection of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and you should not have seen that until now you &apos;ve seen in your business , you can be sure that they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does is it brings people to walk into the business and ask them to ask this question .
now you know what the answer is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , not too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more than the buy of objects that are much more than the buy of objects , the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not the longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor that you go to the doctor and the doctor &apos;s telling you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor , you could tell you , we could make a job .
a <unk> has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and take risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a lot of these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and the risks and the risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , you would do a doctor , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not going to be . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; sounds like a good thing , but in reality , is a shift of the burden of responsibility for the making decisions of the responsibility of someone who knows nothing and probably ill , and therefore , not in the best way to somebody .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for <unk> drugs like it and me , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you &apos;ll expect the doctor to take the next morning and to request a change in the next morning .
something as a identity is now how our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re taking ourselves as much as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up on the morning , you need to decide what to be a kind of person to be you .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the <unk> was that almost every one had one , and they could be able to <unk> them as quickly as they could , and then they could have been so fast kids .
the only true election was &quot; who , &quot; not when , &quot; not when , they did .
now , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach this wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy doing other things , they ask themselves , &quot; i &apos;m not going to marry or not ? i &apos;m going to get married ?
i &apos;m going to marry later ? i should have children , or first , to make a career ? &quot;
these are all <unk> questions .
and they will answer these questions , whether it &apos;s all the tasks that i &apos;m doing to you , and not good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do this . these are important to be asking questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , like , what &apos;s the <unk> , what &apos;s going to do with this technology , that allows us every minute of every day on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel hotel .
there &apos;s actually a corner , i &apos;m going to tell you that the <unk> that works the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice is we have to make it in terms of work again , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids in football , and we have our phone in the phone , and our <unk> on the other hip , and our blackberry probably would have to our lap and our laptop would probably have to our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all <unk> , every minute in the <unk> we &apos;re our child at the <unk> of a <unk> , we &apos;re also going to be , &quot; should i think this call ?
i should answer this email responses ? i should write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly the experience of the <unk> of her child &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material , material things and lifestyle , is a matter of choice .
and the world in which we were living in this room .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all the choices , but not all the one .
and the world in which we now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to be a bad thing about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> , is that it &apos;s going to be <unk> instead of free .
so many options can be able to choose , it &apos;s a lot of people to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of giving a study of investment in a <unk> survey .
one of my students had access to <unk> of <unk> , who &apos;s giant <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 jobs .
and what she was found was a 10 <unk> <unk> who took <unk> , took the participation of two percent .
they provide 50 percent of fewer employees -- 10 percent fewer employees are taking part of a time . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> to the choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide that it &apos;s going to be a <unk> on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , and tomorrow , of course , tomorrow .
you know , it &apos;s not just to say that people have to eat food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the <unk> , it means that they miss great <unk> of their employers .
not only give them to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year per year on the <unk> who were happy to breed their contributions .
so , paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s really what the world looks like this .
they want to really meet the decision , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want the wrong investment in the world , or the wrong <unk> .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the narrative and make a decision , we end less with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to choose less choices between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is actually taking the big choices of different <unk> when they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what &apos;s going on is that they would have a different decision that would have better . and what &apos;s happening is a good decision .
the more ways there is easier to regret is not to regret at all the choices that they &apos;re making .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has a big point in this morning by saying how much the kind of thing we evaluate about it is what we compare to it .
well , if there is lots of alternatives to be concerned about it , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive traits that you agree with that , that makes you less satisfied with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yorker , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great . they have all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my neighborhood neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility of day day , day , a great parking lot .
so <unk> lower happiness is the satisfaction that we get through our choices , even if we have fantastic .
and the more choices there are more attractive to the choices , the more attractive traits that are going into the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is a couple of statements .
he makes a statement about it now and maybe things slowly do slowly .
but a very important point that he &apos;s doing is , always who you decide , is always not going to decide to do other things they don &apos;t .
and these other things like many , many have qualities , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : <unk> of the expectations .
this is made me when i wanted to share my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a kind of time in which there was a kind of a way , and they bought them , and they were bought , and they were incredibly <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and they &apos;ve grown enough , they have enough , they were starting to sit together . &quot;
so to turn new jeans after many years of the <unk> of the old <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i would like to be a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , light <unk> or a half ?
do you want to attract your buttons or <unk> stone or <unk> ?
do you want to be jeans with holes ?
if you want to be a <unk> , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i was i was denied i like to have the kind of thing that was the only way to do the last . &quot;
he had no idea what was that , so i spent an hour that would all be this bloody jeans , and then the store -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- and i &apos;m saying the truth .
i had better . all these same choices allowed me to better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i was bad for me was a bad job , with all of these options , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans went up on .
i had very low expectations . i had no one expectations of it , just as it was in a way .
when you come in 100 species , a damn one of them should be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was going to do , and what i expected was to do was , i was in comparison with what i expected .
the thing that &apos;s adding is where people are inevitably , the expectations people are inevitably , how are these going to be good .
and this is what makes you less satisfaction with the results of the results , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world &apos;s room knows this . because if you were it , you know , you know , you know , you know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that , in all the time , it was better than anything that was worse than anything that was worse , it was to make it possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
now , in the world where we live -- we &apos;re wealthy , in the world -- we &apos;re wealthy , in the perfect , educated citizens , with perfection , the best for you can ever hope is things like you .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant because their expectations are , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all have to come -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short clip moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have it better . i didn &apos;t get <unk> .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad day , <unk> , <unk> , if you &apos;re a kind of a <unk> , and you ask yourself why , the world is clear , the answer is , the answer is , what would you do ?
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available and they buy a <unk> , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it &apos;s .
they could do it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people meet decisions , and even when the results are good , they &apos;re feeling about it , they &apos;re <unk> .
clinical depression runs from the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only thing , but a <unk> <unk> , that explosion of depression , and also , if you have to have the experience of the experience , because they are so high . and then , if you have to explain these experiences . and then you think it would be your fault .
and so the <unk> thing that we &apos;re generally better is , is objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is the official <unk> that we &apos;re all wrong , completely fake , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s something better than not , but it &apos;s not going to follow the more choice than a little choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this very long time to the choice of our public .
now , as an answer , i &apos;m almost done -- as an important question , the thing about the problem is about , what all these choices are enabled in the societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of you , whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that they &apos;re too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and it is : steve <unk> , you know yesterday , how this expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not just that they don &apos;t help it .
they actually hurts .
they &apos;re concerned that we are .
if something of the things that people make it allow us to meet the societies into the societies that would not only improve life of people &apos;s lives , but our dignity would be improved .
economists call this an <unk> application .
<unk> is the fact that it &apos;s worried all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are <unk> .
so , in closing , read this cartoon , and , a <unk> person , says , &quot; ah ! what this fish is ?
you know , it &apos;s not possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i think , the more i think that &apos;s the fish that knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that &apos;s the way they &apos;re possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break that , it &apos;s so that it &apos;s possible , you lose happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost impossible to be a perfect security -- probably also for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i think the <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i guess , in the way .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before the human genome and what that means could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting to have a new point , we have digitized , and we &apos;re trying to make the digital code in a new phase of biology by creating new life and building new life .
we always have to ask about important questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think is that many biologists have tried to understand and that at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve almost nearly 20 years , when we sequenced the <unk> , the shift is to shift in the shift from the analog world of biology to digital world .
now , we &apos;re going to try to ask if we can regenerate life , or whether we can make new life , that digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , so that the smallest genome can be a species that can be able to replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes , from the 500 or so that there are .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our -- trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes , we can be very unlikely that this is very unlikely to live cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to get this chromosome , and it actually allows us to vary the individual components and so some of the fundamental questions .
and so we started to question with the question , we can make a chromosome ?
so it allows the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life were exponentially .
our ability genetic code has very slowly , very slowly , but it still goes , and our last point would be now on the exponential curve .
we &apos;ve started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years out with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out very hard is very hard .
there &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but the more <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to design a new way of creating these little pieces and the mistakes that we could put these little pieces together and the mistakes .
so this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that &apos;s killing bacteria .
we made little pieces , and they made a <unk> and had a dna molecule by about 5,000 letters .
so the exciting phase came to when we took this piece of <unk> chemical took into a bacteria , and that bacteria started to read the genetic code and made a viral particles .
the viral particles then then went off by the cells and they would come back and kill e. coli .
i recently talked to the oil industry and they said that they &apos;re doing this model that they &apos;re doing this model .
they were laughing more than you &apos;re doing it .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that actually can build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go beyond a lot more , we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it has more than a <unk> letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in <unk> from the virus we could vary the <unk> of a living .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information has really become accurate .
when we sequenced the genome first in 1995 , the <unk> at a mistake was a <unk> base .
we found 30 mistakes in the <unk> 30 mistakes if we used to use the initial sequence of the time never possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of the 50 letters long and the other <unk> pieces of <unk> , to build smaller <unk> , so that fit these fit .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have built in the <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t.
<unk> of these letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
we just signed in the beginning .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve so that we &apos;ve engineered the pieces so that we could easily capture them with enzymes . and there are enzymes that these are <unk> and back together .
and we started making pieces of the five to the <unk> of the five to the <unk> of the characters , put these together in order to make these back <unk> to the back of these , to <unk> .
so in every step we &apos;ve made these pieces of surplus in the surplus and we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process , which you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get the point of the <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these big big , with over 100,000 pairs of <unk> -- then they &apos;re not just in <unk> , it &apos;s beyond all the ways of modern molecular biology . and so we can do other kinds of mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism called the <unk> <unk> that biology uses to fix dna that pieces of them can emerge .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of three million radiation <unk> of the three million radiation radiation .
you can see in the upper field that &apos;s just falling apart .
12 , 24 hours later , all of them have been as a result of the same thing .
we have thousands of organisms that do that .
these organisms are being completely dried up completely <unk> , and they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move around to <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are lots of things out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> from the molecule that we made these processes -- actually we &apos;ve used to use these processes -- actually we put them <unk> with the right design of the pieces of the pieces that we automatically . yeast automatically .
this is not a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are footage over the last six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve done recently recently .
these are about <unk> letters in <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule that &apos;s made with <unk> structure that was created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a <unk> of 10 and <unk> , it would have <unk> pages , just to have these genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we do it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple to be very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s just easier when you &apos;re in <unk> like we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out , and you have another in the middle , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve heard about the <unk> of the <unk> .
in <unk> , the chromosome is in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you could give a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to others and can it activate that .
we <unk> the chromosome a <unk> , and we &apos;re so , in the two , it &apos;s like people and mice , we gave some <unk> to destroy this chromosome . and it was very amazing to destroy all the proteins .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there &apos;s the end of the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring it to something .
this is the <unk> evolution of evolution .
we find all species of species here , a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of characteristics in just a second one second one is <unk> .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes the <unk> called the <unk> that are actually digest .
the chromosome that cell has no ; we &apos;ve got it down .
it was deposited in the cell <unk> and the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had a cell at the end of a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> blue because the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , all of all the characteristics lost lost species lost , and <unk> completely in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins that changed the legs , when we were the genetic code , we were reading the genetic code , we were just the thing we have .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> , but we can do it by changing the world , things quite dramatic .
now i &apos;m a statement that this is not the <unk> -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i think that we could possibly create a new form of the cambrian explosion in the cambrian there , that we could give massive new new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re from a six billion people from a next 40 years of <unk> in the next 40 years .
so to ask it , i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three people are in this planet for every year in 1946 , in 1946 , 40 years , it will be four .
we have trouble with food , with the fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for the <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine to nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion of <unk> oil . that &apos;s a hundred million of <unk> .
if we think about biology processes or any of the process to replace it , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 from this material that &apos;s going on in the atmosphere .
now we have now , from our discoveries , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and look at the diversity of it .
we &apos;re in the first line of the biological reality and we put that in the boundaries of the biological reality and we &apos;re at the ones of the idea .
we have now <unk> technologies because of these fast <unk> to do what we call the <unk> genetics .
so we have the opportunity to make a big robot to build millions of chromosomes .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or these processes to optimize these processes to optimize <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can only change a little bit more of a team more molecular change than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a photograph of the actual <unk> <unk> of the work that you actually work on and sit new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily think about it as it gets to look like what &apos;s going to look like genetic code .
we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation .
now , you have a <unk> corn to ethanol , what &apos;s just a bad experiment .
we have the <unk> and third generation of the world &apos;s <unk> and third generation will be going to have much higher , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think the only way of biology is a big impact , without the <unk> of the cost of the diet , or the limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as the world , and therefore we work on the cells that are going to go on .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first time to be the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a way of it .
but in our discovery , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> carbon dioxide in methane by using hydrogen as energy .
we study whether we can use carbon co2 that can easily be <unk> , <unk> co2 in fuel , to <unk> this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> , the <unk> goals , if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise ? you can &apos;t do that at ted ?
but the same thing we &apos;re working on is that the same way that we use vaccines to do this .
you &apos;ve seen this year with the flu influenza , we &apos;re always a year on the end of it , and they have a dollar on a little bit of when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that it &apos;s changed by making <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
this is what the future might look like to change the future , can accelerate accelerate with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re light years from it to improve people , and our goal is to survive that we have a chance to survive long enough enough to survive . thank you .
at the last ted conference , i was an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to you to explain how the machine works .
so now it &apos;s like , and for all those who were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that ever was , 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second after a <unk> second , and it &apos;s been -- and it &apos;s like to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s just an amazing ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the wide wide area , 22 meters in diameter .
so here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction column in the construction process so that you see the scale .
on september 10th of september last september , the machine was the first time .
and this is the picture of atlas .
there &apos;s huge huge <unk> in the control system .
it &apos;s an image of the first <unk> that all the way to the lhc , then we &apos;re <unk> with a part of the lhc to bring a rain from particles to make a rain of particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture , the machine works , we knew that the machine works , what is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is the largest <unk> , or this as a person who went to visit the google and the front page was so found .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
so , about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these calculators to -- these wires are <unk> .
these wires lead <unk> <unk> when the machine is going on .
now , the engineers of you are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far down , you &apos;ll be able to call them .
so , at a <unk> level , cooler , cooler than the space between the stars , can make that <unk> tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnet , the lhc gave a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to heat the wires and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of a sudden <unk> .
this was the result .
now , this is all about the story , if you think that the magnet is about 20 tons of it and it &apos;s about 30 inches .
so we &apos;re going to grow about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all over again .
so , at the end of the lhc , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and i can expect to collect the first data in june or july , and we put our journey on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way , in a way , these accidents , the value of science and <unk> of the <unk> of the boundaries of the boundaries of science and the <unk> of the way it is .
i think the fact that it &apos;s hard is hard to make the fact that we reach beyond our limits , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to think my scientist &apos;s words about a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , like i suspect when he was the <unk> of his <unk> , his name was , his name was so dangerous to the development of the human mind , and that there are no way there is so dangerous to the development of the human mind . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books is my job , my job , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that will change the change .
but the recent thing is a weird thing in my life and my career that i had to have to get me to this work completely completely <unk> .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , decided , decided , decided , in order to all my previous books for some of the reasons in the world , and a large <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter any where i was going to be treated , i &apos;m going to <unk> the fall .
seriously , the butler <unk> !
for example , they &apos;re worried about me and say , &quot; fear is not going to be <unk> that success will never be <unk> ?
don &apos;t you worry about that she &apos;s <unk> her whole life , and never again a book that anyone in the world are ?
okay , that &apos;s really , really courage .
it would be worse , if i remember , i was going to remember that i was about 20 years ago when i was a teenager , i was going to tell you the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t have scared of fear .
did you not fear that you would kill a <unk> ?
did you not fear that for this room for a life , and it never come into a <unk> <unk> dreams , and you never <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> dreams -- your mouth would roll with the bitter ashes ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
and i had always been .
and i was scared more things that nobody would get to .
like algae -- and other things are .
but when it comes to write about writing , i &apos;ve been asking for why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that by someone should be expected to be afraid of the work that he feels to do the work that he feels .
and what &apos;s exactly the creative companies here is that they &apos;re insecure about the <unk> of the collaborative law -- in a way , like other professions , not to do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist that he asked , if he was scared of god to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how about you ?
it just came in front of you , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist , over the centuries , the <unk> group has not been the reputation of <unk> <unk> .
we seem to seem to have this kind of <unk> , but not just the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to be the mentally to have this reputation , mentally hugely unstable .
everything you need to do is to remember the bitter <unk> of really great minds from the twentieth century to see the young and often died of their own hands .
and even those who didn &apos;t really <unk> <unk> , seemed to be neglected , seemed to be neglected .
norman <unk> said before his death in his last interview , <unk> each of my books has killed me a little bit further .
so , a very remarkable statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even don &apos;t even touch somebody , because we &apos;ve been saying that this sort of evidence has been familiar with , and somehow we have the notion of such a long and collective accepted that creativity -- -- in the end -- always the <unk> leads to the <unk> .
the question i want to do today is , is this idea for all of you right now : is this idea for all of you ?
you know , you know , you know , just a centimeter from a centimeter , i feel that i feel with one centimeter at all .
i think they &apos;re <unk> .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s going to take over the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative habit .
and i know definitely that it was for me -- in my situation -- very , very dangerous , to start to start to start to start to start to start in my career in my career .
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i maybe maybe another 40 of <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s probably absolutely that all i &apos;m going to write from the world is being used by the work as the work of being used to the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s <unk> , because we &apos;re all sort of friends -- it &apos;s probably most of them , that my biggest success is .
oh , jesus , what was a thought !
these are the kind of thought that someone can get to get at the end of the day at the end of the day , gin to drink . and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d like to continue to do that work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while , the <unk> seems to me that i could continue to write to write a kind of <unk> psychological design .
somehow i have to find a way to make a safe distance , and i think a very natural <unk> about the writing is going to be the <unk> .
while i was looking for models , for example , i &apos;ve been looking for doing that , i &apos;ve looked for other societies , and i tried to find other societies to see if you could help creative risks with the emotional risks that connect with creativity .
this is a quest to bring me into the old greece and the old rome .
and i want to follow them , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome haven &apos;t believed people didn &apos;t believe that creativity of people &apos;s coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , who was from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from <unk> , unknown .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity &apos;s <unk> .
but by socrates , he thought he would have a <unk> that he would have a <unk> , who was a <unk> .
the roman had the same idea , called this sort of <unk> creative mind , this sort of <unk> genius .
that &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really didn &apos;t really know that a genius of a very clever individual individual .
they believed that a genius of a magic was <unk> , who was literally believed that it literally was a <unk> walls in the walls of a life -- like <unk> , the <unk> and the artist in the work of some kind of invisible invisible and the results of the work of making work invisible .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance , i think , is the distance , i &apos;ve been talking -- the psychological thing that you protect you from your work .
and everyone knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was to protect certain things , like , for example , too much , too much .
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything you &apos;re <unk> , everyone knew you that you had this sort of <unk> genius that you helped .
if you don &apos;t get your work -- it &apos;s completely hard your fault , right ?
everybody knew a genius was a little paralyzed .
so people have really thought about creativity in the west for a long time .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s make the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no room for the mystic creatures that are taking orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity was completely completely from their own individual .
for the first time in the story , you hear people that or some artist call a genius , instead of that , he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of a mere person to allow you to think that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the <unk> and the source of all the divine , creative , <unk> , infinite <unk> , infinite <unk> , infinite <unk> , <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s like somebody to take the sun to swallow the sun .
and the <unk> and <unk> all egos , it creates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> had been <unk> our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative race .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> 500 years just to a <unk> lecture .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience that really wrote a scientific question to sign the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , <unk> people and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m not going to probably take all of you to this journey .
but the question i want to do is , why not ?
why not that ?
because it makes the same sense of how everything else i heard when it was that , the <unk> , <unk> of the creative process .
a process that is -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s trying to make something -- so in other words , in fact , everyone here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , sometimes he can make eye feel <unk> .
i had an encounter encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , which is now over 90 , but she told me she was poet , and she told me she was poet in the <unk> virginia . she said she &apos;d feel like a poem about the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
the one over the country would be on her .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that she could only be one of the things , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> running like the devil <unk> .
they ran as the devil to the house while she was tracked by this poem , it was only about that they could get fast enough to a paper and a pen , so she could get it when it could hit and capture on the sheet and on the sheet .
at other point , they didn &apos;t quickly get enough . they ran and ran and run , but she didn &apos;t get the house and the poem -- she said it <unk> for a <unk> , and she said it <unk> for a <unk> poet .
and then there was these moments -- i &apos;m never forget , she said , that there were moments of moments in which they were almost missed .
so , she runs to the house and looking after paper and the poem goes through her , and she &apos;s taking a pen in her and she &apos;s taking a pen in her and then -- she was like to reach her other hand and get it to the <unk> .
she was a <unk> <unk> poem on his tail and she pulled it back on her body and took it on the paper paper .
so , in this opportunity , the poem came out of the <unk> and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first one .
when i heard that i heard that &apos;s scary -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to be a little bit .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i got to get up every day at the same time , and sweat , and i &apos;m <unk> and really unpleasant .
but i even even myself in my <unk> sometimes sometimes this thing .
and i guess that many of you did this .
i even had work or ideas that made from a source of me that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s the thing for ?
and how do we deal with that relationship without understanding our minds , but we don &apos;t think of the opposite to intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example is how to do this , the musicians you can do this , the musicians , a few years ago , i gave him interview a magazine interview .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom , was tom , embodiment of modern art , who was trying to hurt these <unk> of the <unk> of modern art that was in his late .
but then he was getting older and quiet . he told me that he was a <unk> on a freeway in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he was at high speed when he suddenly hear a little patch of melody , which is how it &apos;s about a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> for it , and he wants them . she &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . he can &apos;t grab it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to see this old <unk> in his tracks , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and will be heard of that song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t get to do it .
but instead of panic , he just heard about it .
he started the whole thought of thought , and she did something completely new .
he looked at the sky , and he said , &quot; <unk> , can you see that i drive car ?
<unk> is i see that i could do a song ?
if you really want to exist , you get a <unk> moment , come on when i can take care .
if not , <unk> is somebody else &apos;s day .
go and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as dark as they were .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him was , when he took the genius of his <unk> , he was <unk> , and he was to <unk> where he was <unk> and he realized that it was not a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , funny , bizarre , bizarre , giving a conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which was not quite a <unk> .
when i heard this story , it was a bit like i worked a little bit like i worked and i &apos;ve rescued myself .
this idea was saved me in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> . i fell in one of those commonalities of the <unk> in which we &apos;re all holding when we work on something , it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> this project .
but then i remember the same thing as a guy &apos;s been talking to the free of the free sky , and i tried to do it .
so i took my gaze off the manuscript and i was talking to a blank corner of the room .
i mentioned loud : <unk> , <unk> , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have all that i &apos;m investing . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have to have it better , you &apos;ve got to show you your hand and your own .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the hell of the hell .
i &apos;m going to write more and more writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a record that i was today for my part of the jobs .
because ... -- at the end , it &apos;s like this : a <unk> of centuries ago , in the deserts of the deserts of <unk> people with holy dances and music for hours of being sent to hours -- to the dawn of dawn .
these are all big , because the dancer were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , it &apos;s very rare , very rare , something special , one of the characters was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you all have a life in your life , you &apos;ve seen this performance .
it was as if the time was <unk> and the dancers through a kind of <unk> , he did nothing else than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but all the time they had .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t know more longer that no longer was in human .
it was <unk> and down by the bottom , and all the <unk> through a <unk> fire .
when something happened at the time , the people knew what was that people called it in his name .
they put together the hands together and started singing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came out of the <unk> , they brought this practice . the <unk> changes over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still <unk> in the centuries of <unk> and <unk> .
if a actors in spain , something impossible to do something magic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part of the next morning when the dancer comes out and the dancers and see it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday tuesday is -- and he no longer a <unk> of god .
he &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe he will never get back to these heights .
and maybe never again , somebody &apos;s name is to call names , but what &apos;s supposed to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> aspect of an creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very much as full of <unk> , if they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence of them .
if you might just believe that they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> of your life that &apos;s passed on someone else &apos;s passed when they &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think i &apos;ve been working on a long time , while i worked on the book that &apos;s been going to be going to be a bit like the dangerous , frightening , seemingly expected of my life .
so what i &apos;m constantly saying to myself , when i &apos;m crazy it is , i &apos;m not afraid .
it &apos;s not <unk> .
do your job .
it &apos;s still just for your contribution , whatever he may always be .
if your job is the dance , dance .
if the stupid of god genius you get to the side , decides for a brief moment , a <unk> of wonder to show you , then <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance , they get your dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you for all of this .
i believe that , and i feel that we should teach the lessons .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for that , you know , you just love the human love and the <unk> , for it .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate the arctic <unk> that the arctic <unk> that had states for nearly three million years of the bottom , 40 percent of it .
but this doesn &apos;t press very much enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the <unk> heart of our global <unk> .
they &apos;re growing in winter and <unk> in the summer .
the next slide i show you is a <unk> which has happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is in red .
as you can see , it grows to the <unk> , this is the <unk> ice ice , and it &apos;s summertime the summer .
so what we call <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to be gone .
this is a problem , because the warming is the frozen reason for the arctic ocean , there &apos;s a lot of carbon on carbon dioxide , which is when it &apos;s <unk> , of microbes , of microbes .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> substances in the atmosphere , it could double double if we cross this critical point .
already , there are <unk> in some flat methane in alaska , from itself out of water .
professor <unk> walter <unk> <unk> in alaska , another group of group at another <unk> lake .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be us .
and a reason is , this is a huge <unk> <unk> of the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume is substantially bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in the greenland greenland .
if you want to know how sea sea is going through , through the <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> into the sea .
these rivers are starting to move forward .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> on the planet .
last month , researchers had an negative <unk> of the whole continent .
and the <unk> that &apos;s been on a few <unk> , particularly very much the melting .
this is 20 foot <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see , you see new lakes that were a few glaciers .
40 percent of all the people are getting half of their <unk> out of this <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the glacier for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in california &apos;s seen the <unk> of the sierra sierra sierra sierra leone .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions that you &apos;ve read them is serious .
this <unk> in the world brings into a dramatic increase in the world .
and the disasters all over the world have really been <unk> and unprecedented degrees of an area .
four times as many of the last 30 years , like in the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve invested 70 million tons of co2 in co2 every single day -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
now , look at the area of the eastern pacific right , the american continent , <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there &apos;s a typical decline in the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one is a factor for global warming , besides deforestation , by which 20 percent is , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and it &apos;s the most important biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest <unk> , and they &apos;re interacting with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of additional <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that have been taken over the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
<unk> is there a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture i remembered .
around christmas , christmas fell in <unk> at me in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
this was what happened to christmas .
one of the advertisement of the <unk> was about the christmas , for the christmas .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy fellow .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance of america , and it &apos;s a lot of our economies to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> is going to clean up every day .
he &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> workers in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of the majority in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you know , what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for success is two <unk> .
this is one part of her .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
so we have a national <unk> set of working on a major <unk> <unk> to spend a <unk> on the way to bring a <unk> on the way that the truth of the time .
the fact is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells like it &apos;s too well .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave it .
<unk> coal , you have a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning of the global warming is global warming , the remarkable clean of <unk> you see here , changes everything .
look at it right now , this is the present , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative is to be an economic alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the economy , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects these all together , is our dependence on <unk> fuels like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there &apos;s a bold new way to liberate ourselves from this <unk> situation .
<unk> america : 100 percent of electricity , within 100 percent of electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to help us make us safer and help global warming .
finally , a solution is that the big enough , our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence fuels from the old , dirty fuels that we &apos;re all up , and we &apos;re going to reduce our world .
the future is here . the wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment for making good jobs for jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old <unk> of an african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come to get far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , and that &apos;s quickly .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask for the time of your childhood <unk> when they were playing with <unk> .
while you realized how to turn the hands and <unk> the <unk> and move the <unk> and move through and problems through understanding and change .
and the spatial thinking is intimately connected to how we understand most of our surroundings .
so as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- combined with my <unk> and my colleagues <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i started wonder : what if we could use computers , instead of a <unk> , who &apos;s moving to a flat <unk> , who &apos;s just ... &quot;
so this question was so <unk> that we decided to explore the trial and <unk> the <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move through your hand , you can see each other , you can track each other , and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are physically physically , why you can only reach them out how to reach it through the hands and access it .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these are the tools , and a conscious awareness of your motions are developing each other , and the subtleties of our <unk> with them , then we can detect new and entertaining new and more entertaining .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this is <unk> <unk> , and if i put it in a direction , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , it &apos;s going to play the video , if i &apos;m going to <unk> it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make it interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by <unk> , you &apos;ll notice that you can see that you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re just feeling like their motions and the way .
so an interesting thing about interactions we started to see is that we could use everyday gestures on data , like colors as well as a half colors , how to do this with the fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to pour color into the middle of the middle store , where you &apos;re going to be mixed .
if we overdo it , we can &apos;t be a little bit of <unk> .
there also also have a couple of nice opportunities in education like languages , math or <unk> , where we give people the way of the fast and <unk> and the results of it immediately .
here i am -- this is a series of fibonacci numbers that i &apos;m with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of combination of <unk> and <unk> .
in fact , you get every round of round on every random <unk> , and as you seek out , words are going to form words , they &apos;re going to this one dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s going to be a mixed and new possibilities for a new new and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are a few children who came up with a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and read a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is , &quot; do you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know exactly what is going to do .
so here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest <unk> down there on the bottom right .
it turned out that he was just wanted to stack the <unk> .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for design design .
that &apos;s <unk> .
he can put new characters in the scene by using the <unk> of the table that shows the character .
here it lets the sun .
the sun is going on .
now he &apos;s going to make a tractor in the scene .
the orange batch .
good work ! yes !
by switching the <unk> and <unk> it to side , he can make the characters .
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open and he can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example , for which i have time , it &apos;s a <unk> for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and <unk> as a sound like <unk> , bass and drums drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can <unk> these notes into the sequence of the sequence you can sequence in any patterns .
and you &apos;ll just throw them a <unk> , just a <unk> .
there are the effects that you can change live , like reverberant and filter .
you hook it with a particular note , and it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s going to be .
and then , even more the effects of how the speed and volume that you &apos;re on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s take a look .
we start to put the <unk> into two <unk> <unk> and those in a row , and they &apos;re going to push them a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit more on doing a little bit .
and now i combine the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of life .
i can speed the whole sequence , by the speed of the speed , by the speed of the speed or a direction .
and now i &apos;m going to put the <unk> on the bass ; for a little bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as it is .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan it in the <unk> , but it can improvise ; it &apos;s <unk> ; it &apos;s going to be more .
and finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> , by drawing the <unk> .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new <unk> of design that &apos;s better to the fit of how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time , you know , part of this new <unk> and some of the ways that we work in our lab .
so the idea i want to give you with the way to this new generation of <unk> is to interaction with digital media , information information in our world that &apos;s going to make our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to the conversation with you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited to me .
yeah , so what should be <unk> ?
i have to start a little <unk> for this time , and that &apos;s a <unk> with the modern molecular molecular .
i study molecular and i &apos;ve been doing now , now a few years ago , i started with the <unk> , and i started to know because i wanted to know more and do it in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned in the study of how i learned
so that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think that the molecular biology now is now in general , so the biotechnology , biotechnology , everything you really count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , is extremely important , and more importantly , much more important will be much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so many times as the whole result of the whole <unk> plant plants on the <unk> .
there &apos;s craig venter in the <unk> <unk> trying to make <unk> , so the gas gas is .
and there &apos;s also things that are totally in the day , most people are going to be aware of what most people are not aware of , for example , that we allow to be 40 degrees of laundry also genetically <unk> .
and the list can continue on endlessly .
and so , from interest , this is what technology , i &apos;m going to go on and further <unk> .
so what &apos;s <unk> now ?
most of most people know that from the <unk> <unk> .
computers <unk> , and then it &apos;s going to be like this in the media &apos;s media , yes , the hackers break down somewhere and the <unk> data and so on .
so this is kind of a <unk> <unk> very sad because it &apos;s not that what it was , actually , what they started like that , and what &apos;s the middle of what is it behind .
and that &apos;s where the <unk> , in the 1970s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also about the internet .
and it &apos;s about a very simplistic , creative , creative way , solving a problem .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a <unk> , what kind of simplify them , so they can be , so you can do that , or how do you do it better .
and it &apos;s got it , it &apos;s <unk> with software , but there &apos;s also it in the <unk> , there &apos;s a whole <unk> that can do with all kinds of things .
and now , now , in biology , and i want to make this metaphor , which is the <unk> , which is actually a <unk> , because , the <unk> code is a <unk> code that is actually a <unk> code that is , it &apos;s not just like the computer , because it &apos;s dynamic .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program that , and you can also hack it , so , and i find that i find incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper .
it &apos;s actually just eight to eight times , these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally in switzerland , that &apos;s the equivalent of the europe and a cooperation in india , but now , members of india has gone around the world , but there &apos;s also a lot of active people around the world .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s this has a more artistic orientation , so there are many artists and philosophers and who are working with scientists with these technologies , and ask them to make these technologies and ask the creative process , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually about to find that such a <unk> access to find so much , so you have an pleasure to have an pleasure .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> network , which is actually more like this kind of forum where you &apos;re going to stop and <unk> online .
they &apos;re a little technical kind of <unk> and a little bit of <unk> on that , and then you &apos;ll be so , yes , asking questions .
and from these networks that have made the whole thing that has made the whole popular , has been a scene that i &apos;d like to <unk> .
so here &apos;s the picture on the left here , the <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , so a private school , nonprofit a nonprofit , nonprofit education , where everyone can do .
kids , old , all kinds of people going to go to the place just by just through the lab , they have a lab and look at what can you do when these <unk> .
here on the left , there &apos;s a group in indonesia , <unk> , is that the one that &apos;s quite long .
more than these other networks are the other two networks .
and the way that we &apos;re doing in this sort of artistic aspect of the biological materials and , yes , also , <unk> , and combine it in a pretty <unk> way .
another group of ankara i met a while a while ago , who have met this one , the <unk> that would like to give the public more more what they learn in school , and they &apos;ve made so so that little action is made and people &apos;s trying to explain what &apos;s <unk> .
and i put up in the other image a lecture in copenhagen in copenhagen museum in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition on the subject .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s most frequent , is quite a young people , but the only thing that &apos;s really , in the united states is this fascination with this fascination .
and what you can do with that , and also , also , and also , in fact , to society and ask , so , okay , what do you do , you know , do you have interest in your life to help you bring them to this ?
so , <unk> , to hack , you need to hack , you need some material .
you need of course biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you normally do is that , in a lab , these are so sort of <unk> machines , extremely expensive machines , extremely , extremely gentle , just for <unk> , trained , <unk> , etc .
and our approach was just saying , <unk> , <unk> , that &apos;s not to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every every one has actually developed a <unk> technology , as most of the <unk> , that &apos;s really , really , that &apos;s the way .
and the <unk> with this premise that i did , for example , brian <unk> in britain , a <unk> <unk> , then then a <unk> <unk> , then then a <unk> and , yes , it &apos;s got bacteria <unk> , working .
so every one that &apos;s known for a soup is that he has left too long , even as it has left too long .
i then put that in my lab home , a little bit , and then i put a little bit on the ebay , and then i bought this <unk> on ebay and a little bit of <unk> analysis , so it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , another time .
now , this isn &apos;t supposed to be a joke , but it &apos;s .
here &apos;s the picture in the picture you see is the lab , so in <unk> , so a <unk> garage with also <unk> that college <unk> has a group of <unk> that <unk> the college , a group in paris that &apos;s pretty successful and pretty interesting things , i &apos;m going to just be a project .
and this is <unk> who &apos;s mentioned , who &apos;s also mentioned <unk> , this is a kind of <unk> principle for molecular biology .
and yeah , you can see it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s pretty much <unk> , so that &apos;s the time of people who are doing it home , so to large , larger , <unk> shape .
but always the approach of the approach that it &apos;s going to be easy to be easy to be .
the first project we did as an international group we made , as we were aware of our own , <unk> , we have now , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know that people are always going to be like .
and then the <unk> <unk> website founder of the founders , and said , we &apos;ve got to make it really , we have to make ourselves , too , and then then put two of the things that was organized , in san francisco , 10 , and shortly in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco , in
and then , there was also about , yes , <unk> , who are we , what do we want to tell , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what is our goals , our foundation ?
and then there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
so that was pretty intuitive , so everybody has just like this wish , his wishes , his , what it was going to do is moving , in the way .
there was , i think , a very good code .
and we have the course of it , but that &apos;s , i think , has been pretty good , i think , has been pretty good , people are quite convinced of this .
and we even tried to <unk> this , too , in the academic world , but there &apos;s no way it &apos;s not going to get that .
so i think we &apos;re out of the <unk> in the direction , even as the world &apos;s academic world .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do now ?
a project that i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we call an optical optical , and optical <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this is when you &apos;re focused on a beam , you can catch little particles in the room , or in the liquid , and then in the fluid , so it &apos;s then captured there , so as a <unk> principle . so , as a <unk> principle .
this really works , this is done in the academic , and we &apos;ve thought , <unk> , we can get a webcam , then the <unk> , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens <unk> , you have a microscope , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> .
you see that there &apos;s down there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> laser <unk> laser and then tries to focus on the laser &apos;s camera , and then you try to focus on the camera .
and it didn &apos;t work , unfortunately , but we &apos;ve got a lot of learning to do .
so another project that &apos;s from french group in paris , which has been working in paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and so he &apos;s got so a well , so a <unk> , so <unk> , or something , so it &apos;s got to be engaged with <unk> , his name is sam <unk> .
he got this helmet and built this helmet and in cooperation with the museum , it &apos;s gone .
so , there could be the visitors in the room , and they sit on the chair , these helmet , these helmet , these helmet .
then , their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they &apos;ve been , is then different lights in the room .
i was a pretty <unk> project .
another thing that &apos;s the u.s. , which is also the same thing that &apos;s also doing with this <unk> device , is the <unk> , the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to copying the genes , to breed , to reproduce , fragments , fragments , fragments that you can see them visible .
so if i do that the <unk> <unk> at the scene , then they go to collect any <unk> , and then they make this apply to the then , and then you can tell , <unk> , this belongs to this , belongs to this person , so .
and the machines that are doing this is pretty expensive that you buy commercial , the way that you buy commercial euros as much as a <unk> .
and this is not just in the <unk> , but it &apos;s really a pretty cool technology that can also be quite much .
so this is just an application of a lot of a lot of that you can do it .
and they have two of two builders <unk> and said , <unk> , that &apos;s what we do and cheaper , and then then then made up open source , so open source , <unk> , and now they have this device to come up and are now the cheapest <unk> of these devices .
i think , kind of six dollars or something .
but it &apos;s now , in any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in any case where it &apos;s been available .
so it &apos;s my opinion of a very <unk> hack .
so a project that i started recently had to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about as far as two inches or so .
you put <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and then put the <unk> into these <unk> , and then i shot that then the <unk> shot , and then it &apos;s like this .
so the device you see here is not working .
but that &apos;s so my prototype that was actually pretty angry , but it &apos;s like a <unk> , so on a branch of that , and pressure , and that was the pressure that &apos;s broken , and the pressure was too high .
and then i took a <unk> and it &apos;s because it &apos;s connected to it .
a <unk> , if you got the full of power , so i think that &apos;s 40 to <unk> bar on top bar , about it .
and so , you can get the particles , and then they go into the onion , and then they go into it .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> <unk> or something like something , <unk> , so to the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so this is the moment that the <unk> of the scene is actually <unk> this availability of technology and also the information and the information that can be able to get involved in there , that is that there is more people can get engaged .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little bit of it and also a chance of it , and also there &apos;s no opportunity to form it .
because if you read about it , it &apos;s not the same as you read , it &apos;s not the same thing as you did it yourself .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a <unk> citizen , make meaningful decisions in society , wants to be able to get and get your access to the technology and the technology .
and you have to do it , and understand it , and understand it .
and the <unk> then then under the <unk> open <unk> and the citizen science .
so that &apos;s how to put it into the position of a citizen , just with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least they &apos;re officially going on on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and also , interesting is that they are represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me that there are fewer people in there , actually than in fact .
so i know some that haven &apos;t been in .
and these are now the <unk> , the individual people .
so , partly , with these <unk> , so these places are in the places .
and that &apos;s very , very , very , very .
like , i said , <unk> has started .
and so , <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> was the first , <unk> .
and this is a gigantic network of very good network , yes , <unk> , which is represented around the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to stop doing the same thing as well , and then they &apos;re also similar to work , and then they &apos;re going to be more good connected people , so that &apos;s going to be involved .
and i would have to invite everybody to deal with this , and even even more what to do .
it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not possible , but it &apos;s not possible if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s the way .
yeah , hi .
how do we work people ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving to as a designer designer , but in the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> , and in front of all things in the field .
and there &apos;s how to have people in interactive media , so they &apos;re going to use these interactive media and so they can create a very <unk> experience .
i think that the interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , so the paradigm that are in our biological memory , so long time is , and we can have just been in the biological memory of very , very long time , and we can do that by interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these <unk> you have to do that these <unk> , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is right in us , in our <unk> roots .
what are actually <unk> models ?
i &apos;ve heard four <unk> and i want to tell you about short .
so to <unk> cognitive models , that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
so to this <unk> models of being heard that we &apos;re a <unk> in principle of the world &apos;s in a rather natural relationship .
and this is basically a unusual principle .
i &apos;m going to go to the same time , and i &apos;ll prove you to prove that , you know , that &apos;s a natural relationship for the reason .
the second aspect is that we &apos;re able to be models since that <unk> models , very , very , very brain models , although we &apos;re nowadays , a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains himself .
we all know that the interactive media is <unk> by definition , which is the denial of the linearity , and what we of course is that we feel the linearity as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place for us .
now , what &apos;s the most natural thing with virtuality is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove this to you .
how many doors have the house that you live in that ?
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and now , just right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re <unk> reality , and it &apos;s a very <unk> computer .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a hard for us to show the <unk> reality in our <unk> , we can actually show that the whole time .
and this is the wealth that virtual reality that people have been in the <unk> times that people have been required in the <unk> times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that had had been her head .
and in that head , memory was going to be a memory .
in this head , <unk> and using these virtual images , which imagination were also passed up to the passed .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with that virtuality with the virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can take a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s all .
the interesting thing about this time is that this time of human beings were <unk> at the same time and medium .
now , if you think a little bit more about it .
what are the world today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll get that to talk about .
the primary tool of the <unk> has been to have been hearing stories .
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , were actually getting to be able to keep up to keep knowledge to keep knowledge in stories .
and we still have very much , very powerful at stories .
the author of the book the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of stories with the <unk> of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s most of the most of the most <unk> most of the time of life has spent most of his life with the stories of stories .
now , we think our love is to tell stories about that we have a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far .
that goes much further , in the cultures of the pre-industrial time .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as we &apos;re particularly powerful , we &apos;re in <unk> memory in our biological memory , the ability to think of <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think of <unk> .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north tribe of the north tribe of the <unk> .
and the living in the northwest , of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you &apos;ve got to navigate , from island to island to get food .
and they have this kind of <unk> done .
you might know that if you &apos;re a bit of interest , from the australian leaders .
they have similar principles .
they have no <unk> , but they &apos;ve used to use the so-called <unk> <unk> or even <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the <unk> and the topography of regions via the songs are being turned .
where the language was <unk> by <unk> .
that &apos;s what you call , you know , <unk> about sound and about rhythm .
and these sound and the rhythm had the geology , the topography of a region , and also , of course , that you could get these songs of <unk> and other things and turn back to the back and back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we know anymore , to get from the top of a b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happened ?
it &apos;s going to happen so <unk> machine .
we &apos;ve moved to the <unk> <unk> .
now , what happens is the machine and is happening , and it &apos;s what &apos;s happened , and is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the <unk> of our individual memories on the external media .
and on the book , on the image .
so we have god &apos;s a piece of god &apos;s a piece of <unk> .
so , in conclusion , demographers have become alien alien for us , and i have become <unk> of reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> of the <unk> , is that way that this mass media , he thinks that this mass media , he thinks the book and the image , so on tv , so what we call the tv , so that we have these mass media .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the machine .
what does things affect our thinking and our <unk> ?
then the <unk> are <unk> motion cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> over the course of the centuries , through the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is , instead of having to remember individually , far in masses of masses , in masses of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t make more .
we have an abstract language of language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing anymore , in the things that no longer in images , but we &apos;re <unk> them .
we &apos;ve used to know that things linear .
and we have the linearity thing as a law &apos;s accepted and there &apos;s just still exceptions , like the <unk> .
what &apos;s remained the remained is the <unk> .
still , we &apos;re the <unk> of the <unk> as a <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the machine , and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called <unk> .
and that sounds very <unk> and look at very science .
but these concepts of the <unk> that will bring us to this opportunity again .
there &apos;s a way to be able to get out , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to just explain a little bit about it .
there &apos;s a technical concepts like the <unk> reality that is the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then a concept that connects us to the virtual world with the real world , which is the <unk> of the virtual world to the <unk> , virtual as a normal , natural , natural as a normal , natural way .
another example is that virtual reality .
so , of course , the <unk> of my presentation is sound like this , because we &apos;re moving into <unk> , virtual worlds , which is the model of the <unk> .
and another example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are rooms that are smart to people .
all this need the ability to accept our fundamental ability to accept that of being a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the end , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also today .
maybe you can wait for a minute , you can stand up to the break in the pause with the two .
and this project is as an example of mine , again , again , again , again , again , about this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say to you .
and what &apos;s the <unk> of mind is extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say , you know , you &apos;ve probably got very likely to be a very likely to tell people some <unk> or you &apos;re <unk> with some of the hand in the hand .
so , in particular , they &apos;re doing that in the place .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s meant that i think that i realized that the world &apos;s real world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce the <unk> that we produce with the real world .
i apologize i need so much .
you can do that as much better , there &apos;s more much more than that , there &apos;s more much more than that .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s about is that i discover a city , by looking at how many places or negative <unk> .
and so i get a completely different sight of the city , a very different sense , which is the case of the negative and positive zones of a city and then -- and it &apos;s a way , virtual map of virtual map from a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here is , sorry , is another one of the things that you see .
of course , this virtual world is in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve made of the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s the machine that we &apos;ve collected from the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s how we walked back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be very , very , to you .
i &apos;ve been asked to have been wondering whether this bag is because a <unk> bag is , and i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m going to throw it out of the same thing , which is in .
but i &apos;m not going to do it , i &apos;m just curious about the little bit of curious .
yes , children are being in natural art of being curious or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m not looking with the issue of curiosity and how to change the curiosity , and why does the curiosity again , and why we &apos;re going to lose it and have to <unk> .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking at with the actual experience as a <unk> .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to <unk> them , they &apos;re often <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half year .
a <unk> for natural user interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask you , why are the whole <unk> of <unk> in the world with so natural communication systems , and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because the things are always more intuitive , more natural , and more natural , and you need to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what is <unk> or intuitive .
and i have a background before i have a natural natural interface , so the next generation of the human computer is to human computer in the <unk> and the <unk> computer to the <unk> computer , as our tools of computers , or how to the computer of the computer .
so i was busy thinking about when i think about what &apos;s natural or do .
you might have to look at it again .
why does this happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , right now , we &apos;re just going to move forward from the third in the fourth world or <unk> <unk> .
so from modern , in the <unk> .
every society is a different <unk> .
at the beginning , the language is through the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked a shared language , you could communicate with each other , is to the same cave or in other areas , cities and created the <unk> <unk> , kind of creating a <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very living .
so , you know , you can &apos;t learn to the <unk> , so no , from nature to talk , but we learn it and then of course .
this is what &apos;s been going to be <unk> through the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
and that was at the time a <unk> , because you of course , the living language began to <unk> in a form of scripture that is what &apos;s going to be <unk> and alive , i go and put it in stone and i &apos;m <unk> it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story , of course , when it &apos;s a lifetime of kind of life .
but then , <unk> , then this was a <unk> script as a <unk> , got .
then the next generation we actually came in today is actually living in the world .
this is just the pressure and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and others .
at the time , it was an <unk> where <unk> , <unk> and other words , are actually insane when the people start to read , then they &apos;re actually insane when the people start to read and that &apos;s , of course , is totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation and the exciting thing , so a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re at the moment in this phase phase , we &apos;re in this phase phase of that we &apos;re involved in .
so the confused of all of us is totally because we see on one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so on .
with the total of total transparency , what the new thinking is , you know , the <unk> <unk> , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> , and no beef , is i just want to just <unk> and want to <unk> .
and these two worlds , just to be new , new and old .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this new society , these new society , <unk> very much of a lot of mechanisms , principles and <unk> the paradigm of the <unk> .
but not more on the local level , but on a global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that &apos;s the theme of ecology , a global .
not if i think about a local organic , and the neighbor is less organic , it doesn &apos;t work .
this is , from the local village , is actually a global village , with the same principles , of course , is intuitively , but also the total transparency .
so as you know , the village knew what to whom with whom and when , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , as , on these mobile <unk> .
it &apos;s like we know globally , and always faster , and they &apos;re still better .
so , as we used to have happened in the village , it happened to the village .
i &apos;ve got a look at this , i &apos;ve got to look at what &apos;s called it , because it &apos;s actually what &apos;s going to do , of course , what we might have , maybe what does the difference ?
because often , people come , they can &apos;t make it <unk> , so it can anyone .
so you have to deal with this , what is it that is , and not just changing it , it &apos;s not just different , but it &apos;s also better .
and then when it &apos;s also about something intuitively , and how can i take care of how a <unk> impact , and just so design that they &apos;re so designing a <unk> , so they &apos;re just doing fun and they &apos;re simple .
you also start to turn it down as well as the <unk> of perception and the <unk> .
and that &apos;s of course what you &apos;re looking at and watch and look like , okay , now i &apos;m just going into the inner self .
and what &apos;s the case of it is actually there ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and what does mean , actually , is intuitively , intuitive and how work our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process does ?
because steve jobs once said you to throw yourself , you <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something like <unk> or intuitive , what does that mean .
and you see , you know , you &apos;re a <unk> , most of the ones we think we &apos;ve only got five , now , there &apos;s seven <unk> , there &apos;s certainly seven <unk> , there &apos;s a next to be able to add an incredible meaning , and as an extension of our own .
and how do we process information , how do we take information on ?
by saying , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many of you use the word , you know , don &apos;t even know what it means to be .
but i need to understand how to understand , in the understanding of information , when you &apos;re using data , when you get data and look out of data , i know how i can do things , and of course , can do you make things like that .
and of course , how does design influence on the perception .
we see this when i make things , i can look at them as much as i can , as you know , is the salt and pepper frog , or i can do it in the kind of intuitive thing , by creating things .
so much of natural natural , in a tank , but i see , in a <unk> , and i see , in fact , is salt and pepper .
and if i tell somebody , you give me salt or pepper , then he will figure out the right thing where is in .
and so on the left , it &apos;s all intuitively , and then i hope that no sugar is in there , there is salt to salt .
but also , our perception itself , how does it do us .
for example , this perception in the context .
so the right circle looks taller than the small , although it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same , and yet it changes , and yet changes our perceptions , depending changes after what we &apos;re doing things .
does anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s actually a lot of my glasses , i &apos;ll be more .
so it &apos;s the case .
a second circle starts to be kind of , some kind of work .
and if i stop in a <unk> , we don &apos;t see that one thing is another unit , which is circle , and circle , and , but we can see a unity of unity , we don &apos;t see more , a circle , a circle , another .
so what &apos;s called the <unk> or <unk> that &apos;s also <unk> us in the perception of perception .
so important for the designers that have the most frequently semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> the closeness , <unk> of the continuity and so forth .
often , in the third , again .
but that &apos;s a essential thing to do , if you think things are going to be intuitively , so you want to design things in the way that you &apos;re doing in your very much more intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting to see this .
sounds like a trivial , but so in a very exciting way , when you &apos;re busy busy .
so we have the front eyes and now think of it , we &apos;re looking at from the beginning .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see from the back to the front .
and she &apos;s <unk> a assumption , you know , you see something you see , <unk> circle .
that means we &apos;re going to <unk> our vision before we see it back to our <unk> , to say , okay , okay , it &apos;s back to our <unk> .
i have so much cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what &apos;s going on what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s the way that comes back again .
then , it goes back to the front , because the back of the front , and says , look at the back of the front , and you can really get you off , if you see what you want to see , is that what you want to see .
and then it &apos;s going back to the back and then it &apos;s going to be .
so a very , very <unk> process , like some things happen , and what kind of <unk> things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know from you this image .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i described .
now everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to see .
does anybody see something ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that there &apos;s a <unk> in it , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> in it , you know .
you &apos;ll never forget , you &apos;ll never forget , because i &apos;m showing you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and on , now you see it always .
so i &apos;ve been to <unk> them now that you don &apos;t see any <unk> patterns , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short time , and then i put them in a very short image , and then again that the dog can see in this <unk> image .
and this is the projection of looking , <unk> , see .
now i know , i &apos;m going to <unk> this , i &apos;m going to see that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , is actually , in fact , gray is actually not , but here &apos;s a <unk> mass that &apos;s just going through it .
anyone knows what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know about as designers .
if i know about it , something takes three seconds to me , to the present , i can also bridge very well <unk> , i can bridge very well <unk> that i always put with three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process it &apos;s a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegant , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what does a matter of <unk> milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you love in love .
that means if you know this , you &apos;re looking at who you know how long you look like long , because i don &apos;t have a <unk> for what you can happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most of the most of the sensations we have .
so this is the first glimpse of a fast fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things , we see how we &apos;re looking at our environment , and we &apos;re also <unk> against our environment , so we can think that way .
of course , the creator of the topic is about , and <unk> <unk> or <unk> , but mostly , of course , with the theme of the <unk> .
so , as a human being in some sense , it &apos;s based on .
there &apos;s so much more interesting functions , so <unk> things or <unk> things .
there &apos;s <unk> where i know exactly where i need to reach .
but there &apos;s a symbolic functions , why is somebody such a little <unk> , where nothing is <unk> , so <unk> money on money , although it &apos;s not so practical ?
there &apos;s been on the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , which we as designers of course , as we kind of , of course .
back to my real theme of natural interface and the subject , which is , of course , is also <unk> .
<unk> means how can i get a certain goal or how can i get a more goal in a certain <unk> situation , efficient and <unk> one goal .
so it &apos;s really about the norm .
how can i make a little more <unk> ?
i can do that right , or i need to be the same manual or i need it , i &apos;m an training training for this .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
i mean , i &apos;m just going to make it differently and make fun , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you put in the software that we saw , you &apos;ll understand what &apos;s <unk> percent of our world &apos;s software or not to be <unk> , is the <unk> in many areas or <unk> , although it &apos;s more intuitive is a lot more intuitive than classic software software .
and this is intuitive <unk> not ever since apple is a fundamental <unk> , <unk> of the world &apos;s fundamental <unk> , if i could make a technological devices of the people .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re usually in this new kind of <unk> , so the natural user , are <unk> , for example , five times the average of the average .
you have to imagine that they &apos;re doing something of the classic <unk> , five hours , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably probably four hours to go home , but you can &apos;t have your employers or anyone , you know , how he was doing it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a <unk> for us , of course , is a <unk> , some things .
so if we &apos;re going to take a little bit back into the software of the software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line of interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next thing that now is to have a <unk> model or the mental model of how the software <unk> , they &apos;ve had been working , you have an idea of something that &apos;s the metaphor , the metaphor , the metaphor to make the computer .
so no more ones , and they &apos;re ones or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
so this was a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s also , of course , of course , much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> is a lot more to behave with behavior .
so there &apos;s a lot more more than a very important thing as a result of a very more more frequently than that .
that &apos;s also the paradigm shift .
i think that this is always the appearance of the appearance of success , just the <unk> app of a app .
and then when i turn into a step of <unk> into these natural interfaces , where i &apos;m using a voice , by language , by <unk> , by the gesture , and no more or <unk> things , then i &apos;m going to go faster and still sit .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do with me again , when things are actually more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , i have to get my little friend here and look at my little friend here and look at what &apos;s because of course , the <unk> , when is really intuitively ?
and that &apos;s a thing for us to do something intuitively , if i think about it , you need to think about it .
so he wouldn &apos;t want to think he &apos;s just like , but it &apos;s just just making it just just do .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that is , if we look at that we could use existing <unk> from one to something else , like the metaphor , then i can use it as a creator .
so i can just have an intuitive , human <unk> software software in software to create the software that makes software <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of us , and now i &apos;m going to tell you .
that &apos;s what we call the <unk> .
it &apos;s used to each of us and <unk> is an acronym and it &apos;s about getting forward , <unk> , <unk> .
it &apos;s all the time you &apos;re doing all the time , but it &apos;s kind of intuitive , and it &apos;s sort of intuitive , and it &apos;s partly instinctive .
the model is already <unk> in the womb and is <unk> , so it &apos;s work around the world &apos;s young and old , and it &apos;s used to be used by all the time that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> times about us , so in the sleep , so you found that it &apos;s less often <unk> than a day .
now i can get this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but now , no more abstract object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher , <unk> , when the transmission of a classic metaphor , is the <unk> metaphor .
and if i &apos;m going to <unk> this , for example , when i &apos;m in my mind , <unk> <unk> as a choice , i know , it &apos;s big to me , i can see it somewhere or someone and so on .
then i can transfer this whole thing .
i &apos;m going to try this time by a <unk> .
i think he &apos;s eaten everybody &apos;s cake .
<unk> : now i &apos;m using the object , i can sort of <unk> the object , again , <unk> .
i &apos;m going to filter all the whole way , can now filter this up and tell me , just just like chocolate for chocolate for example .
and once again , a interface which is a lot more intuitive and much natural natural .
because i think that things can reach the things that can take the way to , <unk> , and they come to me is substantially natural than if you can do about <unk> <unk> websites or other kinds of things .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with this phrase i &apos;d like to close to you , a and more and more to give the evidence , too , designers need to come to the new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much , you &apos;re excited for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re a child , as a child , is that they take care of what they do , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the <unk> and the more , kind of , is , i &apos;m going to work .
and the curiosity don &apos;t take .
all of these are the ones that are and curious about these are people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about to basically this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years , <unk> , in quality of doing it .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> is a chance .
every day they give them the two , they &apos;re likely to take magnitude , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to take two grams .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just be as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t do phosphorus , we &apos;re not going to take phosphorus and get them .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re concerned about something that &apos;s actually a <unk> , but not that is that it &apos;s not that .
because all the talks about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have two years phosphorus and already , and already , by the <unk> of the world &apos;s much more dynamic in the environment , as in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of <unk> were distributed to our fields in germany .
and we take it all .
it &apos;s doing leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little bit less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , is less cars .
<unk> the environment , making less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but this is not an protection .
this is how if i would say , <unk> your child , just <unk> it , just three times rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit of destruction .
if we think of that from the <unk> to the <unk> , our world used to be a <unk> or a <unk> .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> .
and the most important thing about the ground is to look at the ground as a first time .
in the soil , over <unk> percent of the <unk> are stored .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and losing the corn between 11 and 30 kilograms or 30 pounds per hectare , or to the square square , also <unk> .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than being treated at the ground .
we can see the <unk> look at the <unk> .
and it &apos;s all packaging .
in <unk> , the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> has now <unk> <unk> .
and because we &apos;re older , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to use that .
that &apos;s all of them are in the <unk> .
yeah ?
a baby needs to take a <unk> .
we could do that by 10 percent , but what does that do that ?
this is going to be in a second in terms of a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with this <unk> ?
so this is an example of the way that men are not pigs pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be about the <unk> components of the solid components .
people are about the urine of the urine .
yeah .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s been here in this case , right ?
traditionally , we think we &apos;re in the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and when you say people that are there to exist to people exist when you say that would be better , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and be hostile .
and so someone says , &quot; gore gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> the earth .
here &apos;s the time you &apos;re <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , is we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants look at the weight of the ants on earth , then you weigh the ants about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the u.s. , i don &apos;t like termites , in this room , although they &apos;re vegetarian .
that is that the ants are more much more than we &apos;re .
and because they physically work harder work , when we live three to six months , they &apos;re going to be like in their weight , in the energy , in the energy , in the energy , 30 billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we could really do , and we could really do , and how sad we are , we &apos;re that we &apos;re at all on the earth , you can see that , for example , a <unk> , to 20 , 20 , would you want to be here ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yeah ?
the only one .
have you seen a tree of a tree of tree ?
yeah ?
one ?
so that &apos;s what &apos;s called our whole intelligence means that we &apos;re going to be more than the trees , right ?
yeah ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> in trees .
there are still six billion trees alone , still six billion trees .
you &apos;ve heard about it all the time from <unk> ?
that means all of our intelligence means we should be more than the trees .
and where you see , even when demeter is <unk> , the <unk> of agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> back .
every year , we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go into the cycles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that is what we &apos;re feeling as guilty about the earth we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as they all hot , they allow our own <unk> back to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to eliminate our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about , it &apos;s about , it &apos;s about , you know , a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the ultimate , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were shooting , you would have to have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve this .
we can do it differently .
we can get rid of our nutrients .
we do not make in brazil agriculture where we get rid of the nutrients .
so , in fact , we can put nutrients in this way into agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example where we &apos;re taking the waste of it .
in china , a <unk> is still <unk> , so , in the way , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients <unk> .
that is , the whole western <unk> draws on that town is only taken out , but the farmers have never had a few back .
and so , by the way , the cities were growing more , because the farmers are going to go into cities and the cities to keep getting their nutrients away .
all the western empires are always expanding , and they have infrastructure until they didn &apos;t have the infrastructure and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you know , you &apos;ve got a <unk> civilization for about five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always got to get rid of the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to food , you &apos;re expected to eat that long as long as you stay to see the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , and the nutrients will take nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see the internet , you can see the quality of the nutrients .
so this is actually beautiful about if you do that , agriculture is power , a square country with five thousand country in favelas , can a farmer for about <unk> in a hectare of five , and the facility for that chickens and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a fruit and a
and the great thing about this is that the u.s. economy is going to put over the favelas around the <unk> .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , very little bad .
we can support them , well .
this is of course , of course , but the equipment are carrying themselves .
the <unk> is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to design that a farmer can just grow it .
so that &apos;s what the <unk> goes back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve been built over the <unk> over the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been <unk> .
they could just throw a liter of a liter of <unk> and then you would be ruined for the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people , not to be very bad .
we can support them , well .
that means we need to phosphorus <unk> .
and by the way you want to do what you do , you write in germany , in germany , the best thing to the best is to work in .
unfortunately , the <unk> who don &apos;t come in , but maybe you can actually help the <unk> of it .
because the <unk> device could be the best phosphorus back .
and that &apos;s got to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s absolutely well .
we &apos;ve used over three years now .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country around the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there is a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , the 40 percent of the <unk> control of the <unk> control .
and the oil will replace us through other energy .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
so it &apos;s not about the existing existing existing thing that makes a little less bad , but it &apos;s about to do something right .
and it &apos;s particularly one of the questions that &apos;s right .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not to efficiency .
in the netherlands , you know , of course , it &apos;s easier because in holland &apos;s land , the land on flowers .
yeah ?
imagine if for instance , your wife sad , if you &apos;ve got them , and you &apos;re coming in , and you come with 50 of the roses .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s very effective and it &apos;s actually ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six of three pounds in their life .
it &apos;s about .
this is not a scientific thing , because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be about .
but a <unk> , even in these lighting , i can tell you , is very inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
it &apos;s beautiful that &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
that &apos;s not just resource efficiency , but efficiency .
so , what &apos;s the right ?
not to ask the <unk> another bit better and burn it to <unk> and <unk> all the materials for the whole materials to go to the bottom of the whole materials , but first of time , how do you do ?
think it &apos;s efficient .
yeah ?
if i &apos;m going to dinner for dinner , and say , there &apos;s a tablet with a <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , is it ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you could fall in somebody &apos;s fall , efficiently ?
yeah ?
that means everything in life counts , is not to save the fact that we &apos;re going to stop .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , oh , you haven &apos;t got green green in the south .
no , it &apos;s exactly the right , yes ?
everyone &apos;s where you &apos;re <unk> , you , yes , you &apos;re going to <unk> back .
but the wrong things .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we think about the north of the north .
there is every footprint on it .
if you walk , yes , it &apos;s <unk> , every footprint .
because the soil will die , and the wind will die off and the wind and the water is the floor .
if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water has no longer in the meadow .
so it &apos;s about to create a big footprint , which is a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say to sustainability .
yeah ?
but if i ask you , how is you about your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
i say , <unk> <unk> , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , it &apos;s not going to avoid .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like the people in high <unk> , so coke &apos;s made out of the car .
because you know that this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a <unk> form , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
but with the right design , i &apos;m going to be beautiful .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> <unk> , which is in temperature room &apos;s liquid .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re going to make it everywhere .
and they &apos;re seed seeds of rare plants , so they can do it by the way that throw into the biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s going to happen two .
not all of it should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , the need to be so used to be in biological systems .
the things that only is used to go through technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
so , all of the ads , and not for the company , <unk> <unk> , but for that they help them now to help these products to succeed .
because we don &apos;t do it , we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yeah ?
so , if i eat them , and say , this is free from <unk> , it doesn &apos;t help you all .
no , we &apos;re stuck , what is inside .
positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in there .
it &apos;s all the way that it &apos;s useful .
so these are the first shoes that you can see the <unk> of the <unk> can be <unk> and the way to <unk> <unk> , yes ?
everything that is <unk> .
and if it &apos;s all the way we can do it , of course , for nike , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> , and the whole industry with the <unk> .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s <unk> around the world that caused by the textile industry .
so you help you ask for questions for people .
hey , <unk> , do you really work serious ?
because they have now the <unk> <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure that you really <unk> .
so , you know , they &apos;re going to help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s all about .
yeah .
what &apos;s been shown in that .
that &apos;s what goes .
we can now make things so that they can throw in when they &apos;re <unk> , they can put them into biological loops .
technical is the same thing .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> for this one direct .
this is the first ecological camera , actually , the way to go into the cycle of the cycle .
so , you know , that &apos;s in every store , you can do things .
if you come up , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> ?
if the trash is the trash .
all the way that <unk> around all the way is almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s a front on the <unk> , but the other in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside that they can go back , then they can go back with a baby in the clinic or in tunisia .
yeah ?
just if you take these these <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , sterile and the powder is to take off the trees to plant trees .
so the baby &apos;s <unk> for life , it &apos;s already from beginning .
so , we need not be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so , kind of .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can do it again .
i started to have an institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people there , and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s a <unk> to where you have a <unk> , where anyone can be involved .
so no longer saving , it &apos;s not saving , it &apos;s not a <unk> , but smart waste .
does it curious that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music is as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that as a <unk> , myself as a <unk> , so in english , i understand .
<unk> are the <unk> notes in <unk> music .
you know , you don &apos;t just word a word for word the text into a different language , but the deeper sense of the words and <unk> sense to make it make a good translation , knowing it with the <unk> .
you know , the german german in english can &apos;t require more , more , because it &apos;s when you ask it to poetry or all the poetry .
but a lot of alien is it for <unk> , what we do with our <unk> do .
as a <unk> , i took the <unk> notes .
you think that the composer is exactly what the composer has exactly <unk> , what he thought has been .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are about exactly as a <unk> or <unk> , like a verbal , albeit very seemingly precise , description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of flowers don &apos;t smell to smell the level of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> don &apos;t hear the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
today i want to show you what i would like to be , so <unk> , <unk> , even in a verbal language .
so basically , one translation of translation .
so i prefer to do it before you know this whole rather than german , because if i had to translate into english , it would be equivalent for me to give you translation translation .
so the music works for me as much as the word language language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a typeface .
so it &apos;s not going to take notes to read just reading notes and the <unk> to a <unk> or the right place on a <unk> bar .
so this is just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the meaning of the letter is to see if you can &apos;t see the language .
so you need for the process of music , you need to be equally as long as the word language works for at least as long as the word word .
there &apos;s also <unk> , if you learn it for the <unk> , you know , passively , or you can also talk to the musical crowd , to the musical crowd .
the work of the <unk> starts like the one <unk> .
after you first , a piece of chose to play because you &apos;re excited about , you &apos;re going to take a <unk> , you &apos;re just a passages of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of information in the <unk> .
you read in the letter , <unk> , notes , or dare , or dare to be the thoughts of the composers .
you know , you know the work that he took before and after .
you compare comparison .
the <unk> , it &apos;s writing .
how did he really feel ?
how were his lives of the circumstances of society and politics ?
i &apos;m interested in this .
you think in this time , by looking at the example of the picture of some kind of <unk> or reading literature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also got a rich knowledge of the composers of the composers that you play more and it &apos;s falling up to you and it &apos;s falling in it and it &apos;s still easier to feel it .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend that lives together .
his cause to write the piece , is more and more and more to my personal concerns .
because the notes of all others as a <unk> record of the cause of the <unk> of the composers of the composers , but just a framework , i think that framework to <unk> it back with meaning and meaning .
i &apos;m going to say to my own words , what &apos;s between this framework .
i play <unk> , which would mean these sound could have .
now for me , and for the composers of that , and what you might mean for him today is .
every note , every phrase gets to get a sense because i feel it myself because i feel it from my <unk> .
it &apos;s got to me in here and now , and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to that , i can &apos;t convince my audience to that .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience of the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve done as long as it did in the way to experience it .
you know , how you happy once again , again , even though the same rituals of life , and get up with the same rituals of life , getting up , their name , so , also , the same thing i &apos;ve ever been going to do is again .
i &apos;ve become older and older , the seasons move , my pulse goes down , and my pulse goes down to the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer to come back to home .
i think the way that the audience is true , or unconsciously , or unconsciously .
all that affects me and all these things affected me , my experience with the composition .
so , quite wonderful , if i &apos;m standing with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you &apos;re going to take a new idea in and we &apos;re going to be a answered with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things we don &apos;t have <unk> , and what you can &apos;t get samples .
it &apos;s a great fun job to make music in this way , and you &apos;ve seen as the audience , how the music is life .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this .
i can &apos;t play it today like this in 20 years .
there &apos;s more <unk> than today i &apos;m today , as i &apos;m today , and i &apos;m therefore on my palette of the <unk> more <unk> , emotions and emotions as today .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but for this new <unk> .
have a nice example of it .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> in my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and a professor of <unk> in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was <unk> , when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to know him very early , and at age 13 years , i was making a <unk> , and i was in high school .
i was at the time 17 when i went to a college and played the last one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four <unk> of the chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this was <unk> for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
so , he <unk> , and he said , &quot; this is what ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s got to be the <unk> .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 , you just have dreams , but no significant memories .
i play a game today , and i play it for a few years , and it &apos;s always been , although not the one of the very literal .
so every time it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m going to read something new .
one example of a very different area , and a monet has made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but it &apos;s different <unk> , at <unk> light .
he has translated the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as it was in this moment .
his personal favorite <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of the piece of a piece is like this .
now i &apos;m also older than chopin was a chopin with a <unk> years when he wrote the piece .
he was just <unk> years .
and it &apos;s important to look back into the notes , even if i mean , you can undo .
to keep <unk> , right by the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start to talk about the language of music music ?
i said yes , you need to take something like the word language .
often the <unk> is so you that you can read the notes in the notes .
you learn to read virtually this , just before you just a word a word .
you learn to the notes on the instrument to find the instrument .
when all the time , and you &apos;re just like it in the notes , then then they &apos;re moving into the notes , then they &apos;re holding notes together , like music .
when that &apos;s all the <unk> , the student gets the <unk> of the time .
it &apos;s not a <unk> talk about the interpretation of the <unk> .
well , there &apos;s the front line in front of the front , which is a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
so loud and <unk> , and b , &quot; and b , etc .
this is what most of them here .
but even if you put these data , it &apos;s always just a technical technical .
and yet it &apos;s not a matter .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something quite <unk> .
namely , to make music in the instrument , your musical and feel about it before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn it because it didn &apos;t have <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t get the parents .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to be his own experiences and the idea of music to have the music to make it over another way , so on an instrument that would sound .
people who never have been singing in the singing , have never felt immediately with their own body , like it &apos;s , you know , a sound .
so an expression of his own breath .
the instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords , the hands of our hands and feet , and feet .
so the <unk> in the piano the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> nowadays music nowadays is not a <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make more music even if it &apos;s boring .
no more necessary to laugh , i would have a <unk> laugh or singing .
every single music is <unk> , if you &apos;re constantly <unk> by the outside of music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , some of you who are , if i don &apos;t know ?
i &apos;m not going to ask you , you can &apos;t sing , a because you think they &apos;re not singing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing , singing ?
so , in either , it &apos;s not too late to start to find out whether you can &apos;t yet , or learn how to muscles , how to muscles , the vocal chords , the vocal chords , right .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it , you &apos;ve got <unk> .
i wonder , how <unk> could be this diagnosis ?
have you already a <unk> or <unk> , you know , how you &apos;re beautiful to say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to do it , and you &apos;re not trying to do it .
but what i would regret but is music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can &apos;t even <unk> them .
so , you see , you see , all the time you have to be an <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t say i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s good or bad .
because i &apos;m sorry , but you can tell you whether it &apos;s like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s taste of me because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them , they tell whether it doesn &apos;t taste them or not .
whether the music is to be you too <unk> or too sweet .
tell you what you feel .
and with the time you get to get some more spices , and you want to taste more spices , or taste , even there &apos;s no difference .
why am i now asking by my audience that &apos;s going to be active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art that you never look at is not force .
the food that &apos;s being cooked from a chef or a chef <unk> , and not just looked at recipes or recipes .
so you hear if a music is played .
she &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if you &apos;re in an environment where the adult music is going to make music or at least , a child , then a child , then it &apos;s a light <unk> , and you ask what color does your flower ?
can you actually play them in blue ?
and the child &apos;s playing , after a <unk> , rather than a <unk> , a blue flower is a blue flower .
and this sound is very different than before .
and that was the first one , the very first beginning of a traditional expression .
so the first step is to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of life today , this is a project that was originally in a hundred years ago ?
now the instruments have been <unk> .
there was an instrument of time using bach . no piano at all .
it was just not invented .
i think that the bach &apos;s been excited if he had the <unk> of modern <unk> had had a lot of time .
i can now the <unk> that bach has taken the bach on the <unk> , the <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
so , as i know , he knows that he was more than he was deaf .
today , modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a <unk> orchestra from the time .
so the composers of us are breaking us to the bits of the pieces again .
so it &apos;s going to be , what they &apos;ve got to mind is in mind .
and you also think of what would be thinking about today .
or what i &apos;m going to do is , what i could do is , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were you all jealous ?
and how does that feel like that ?
it was <unk> .
i have a friend who drive a <unk> .
so when i come to , with my little v , i &apos;m <unk> w , and i feel next to this feeling .
i &apos;m going through something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to do with the n of this ?
that &apos;s already losing the first year half of his value .
and at all , you know much less than i do .
why does i have to afford to afford a little bit like this ?
and then immediately , it &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , this is an awkward feeling .
our organism has a great way to invent as unpleasant emotions as the best way to make this sound .
you can also try to try and words like revenge or <unk> or something .
i want to tell you a little bit about this mechanism , or something that you &apos;re probably probably unconscious .
the mechanism is that it &apos;s from a lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you might heard you might have heard when people say no one &apos;s intent .
and then rocks <unk> , so he &apos;s <unk> you &apos;re going to <unk> them .
in the way , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes you light <unk> that he &apos;s totally different in the sense of it .
he doesn &apos;t just get it , and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , the way that they &apos;re talking about , they &apos;re themselves .
they need to lie to this lie to a <unk> to get a <unk> .
they can light them up less , yes , <unk> or even the speed .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman &apos;s <unk> .
this woman was a <unk> , the portrait you wouldn &apos;t see .
picasso : wait for just .
it &apos;s always going to be similar to them .
and at this point , if you laugh , you realize how important is that lie and how much time you need to know something about something , what artists are very good at us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist &apos;s telling you something with , and particularly this lady , what you can &apos;t see is just if you just look inside the mirrors .
the artist &apos;s giving you a portrait of something like a <unk> , something you &apos;re going to be familiar with , when you look back at this art .
and then this awkward feeling , you couldn &apos;t see it &apos;s very much not like , and it &apos;s always going to be similar .
so here &apos;s this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not just in the art , too , in the mythology of the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology .
you may know this idea of the lady that every morning looked at the mirror every morning and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in all the country ?
one day , this mirrors , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
and then , behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you know , as well as much hostility from this true , the mirror can &apos;t lie out of the mirror , the mirror can &apos;t lie .
but we should just be familiar with that , you know , you can &apos;t tell you a woman &apos;s a <unk> somewhere in different .
here it is necessary to what we understand under <unk> , again .
we need this <unk> of the spot that we don &apos;t yet yet yet yet yet .
we don &apos;t just have to just sort of art in the <unk> , but also in science , but also that &apos;s great .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife &apos;s <unk> .
she heard from this book by charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of the people .
that should be the man from the monkey <unk> and , yes , there &apos;s at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she <unk> her , and she said to her husband and said , that &apos;s not true , what charles is .
the person should be <unk> by the monkey <unk> or a common ancestors .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it is true , we need to prevent people that people know that people will get to get this time .
why don &apos;t we need to stop people &apos;s knowledge of something that &apos;s true when it is true ?
because we cannot live these <unk> .
because we , because we , this feeling , great to be great , descent of the most highest creatures , not from one of these most <unk> , of such a <unk> such as a organism , a stone , and things like that , that &apos;s for us .
so we can &apos;t have these things .
we need to stop that people know that people , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism and what the tracks look like that it &apos;s leaving something else than that , as a great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a very beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she was telling me by a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to think of it because it &apos;s an electrode for your grasp .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m on the fire floor .
and because i &apos;m on the fire i &apos;m interested in doing things for <unk> things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re <unk> , at this point , there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a person in a moral <unk> , the <unk> is used to the <unk> because we should try to replace it through the future .
you make that once , you know the sentence .
although i &apos;m on the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that this is the actual truth behind the origin of the origin .
so a little <unk> that &apos;s not interested in the <unk> .
the interest in the <unk> .
but there &apos;s no <unk> that we can move to us where you can do fire .
there &apos;s just the second second second , just the fire brigade .
there was a signed .
and <unk> , you know , he &apos;s also saying his teacher &apos;s , you like to put it in somewhere , and you &apos;re excited when the fire turned out after <unk> .
no , it looks just much better when we show that we are in the way we &apos;re in the world that &apos;s first to clean the risks , if they just fire fire .
here &apos;s this little mechanism .
these <unk> that <unk> that in the <unk> knows that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t be loud .
here &apos;s the <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious of the conscious and the conscious , who immediately <unk> something about it , and things that you know that they look at very different , and others can be much better for them .
so then just like these words that we &apos;re in the language of the politically politically right time , again , again .
we actually know that something else &apos;s case is .
but we know if we &apos;re doing this , the social condition is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do it .
it &apos;s impossible to be able to work like this , in a society that works .
i want to give you a point of what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
what &apos;s the logic of logic , these self-deception self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than that we actually know that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
and i want to give you two , maybe we present three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of them , some of them , very few , not even at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so much <unk> , and it &apos;s about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stopping the nature , the nature of nature .
and if you have people before you have to find a soul , you know , you own a soul , or you can also tell you the believe that they have been <unk> by the soul to have a <unk> frame , and blood , <unk> , <unk> , yes , <unk> , yes , yes , yes .
and by this soul , you think that they kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> , in latin america , is present to present .
and when this <unk> then goes through the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with spirit that only live , yes , with the soul .
and then he can just <unk> .
so this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re going to be able to see them as something that could be present to our lives .
and if you have that condition , you understand the logic that you &apos;re going to experience this fortune , which is to experience a lie to a lie to the world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> you know from school .
now , this is a <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> player who &apos;s a <unk> player .
so this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you need to be a little bit of logic here , but the willingness to lie .
and so to lie , you can just apply this logic to this logic .
in this <unk> , three sentences in this video .
the first sentence is , <unk> claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , the <unk> is right , it &apos;s got no soul .
now there is a third sentence .
i showed him in particular .
third sentence , which is immediately , with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the people say who &apos;s not a soul who is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here it is .
here &apos;s this logic here , yes , in this <unk> talk , the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two of the sentences , the ones are correct .
i can claim it all .
the logic is not about the reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i was right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t quite have a right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic is not statement about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just .
so when the <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our consciousness is immediately consciousness , and it can make something .
it &apos;s based on a third sentence that nothing can &apos;t do with the first two sentences and the way that the opposite phrase was proven to proven that and <unk> .
because we actually have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it &apos;s easy to use two sentences that are correct , and a third <unk> that looks like this , and so he looks something that is going to do with that , so we can save our <unk> .
so we pretend to be , as though it was actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things to continue .
in the present , we have a very modern illustration of that time , which is still the <unk> .
now , this is a more powerful topic , a <unk> of the philosophy of philosophy , is present .
so this is what we go back into the <unk> century .
there was an <unk> scholars , johannes <unk> , and after the one &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is made of pure nature .
it &apos;s not that the soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you place the exact in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a little bit about it should go first .
so he stands in the middle .
so the <unk> showed .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , if you &apos;re going to get a little bigger , you don &apos;t need reason , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing .
automatically is going automatically .
if you have that idea that you &apos;re somehow being driven in nature &apos;s way , <unk> , from the larger crowd that you &apos;re going to put a straight , then you have to feel quickly that there will be something like a free of will .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> , i remember the <unk> <unk> of brain brain .
there &apos;s a <unk> , who is called the wolf <unk> , and he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> , claims , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second sentence and see if the wolf <unk> is right , it doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read about every day in the newspaper , this is what you find in this third sentence .
this looks like this , who has no <unk> , can &apos;t be the action and claims for responsibility , and it &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , it &apos;s again .
actually , you have to prove if there &apos;s something like that there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so , as if the first sentence was wrong , you &apos;d like to take the opposite of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything if you want to do anything , if you &apos;re doing yourself , and particularly when you &apos;re willing to do anything , you know , this courage to lie to a lie .
so , for instance , this is when you meet a person who you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please use the german word word for <unk> , which is the prophet .
they won &apos;t call them , and then they &apos;re a little politically politically <unk> .
they say there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , they &apos;re going to be one of the things that you have to experience and you experience these <unk> , you know , you can &apos;t prove it .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because it &apos;s while they &apos;re busy making it , they &apos;re not going to prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , is the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s misled .
because he has a <unk> , he &apos;s got himself to get it himself .
because it &apos;s actually not prove to prove it .
it &apos;s just interested in himself to be able to prove himself to prove himself to that there &apos;s a <unk> .
so , in the way the shift in the appearance of the <unk> are actually the <unk> of the lie .
and once you once again have an opportunity to feel this <unk> in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy , if they &apos;re happy to do that in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to have asked me , i could just mention if i could .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here , and i asked me , if i wanted to take a talk here , and my idea is to give my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve been <unk> it , it &apos;s been <unk> to me at the beginning of my idea .
and i may not be my <unk> , maybe my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but of course , the sum is quite , very many ideas .
i probably probably probably probably have the two nice girls here , i &apos;m probably probably one of the generation that &apos;s been aware of this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve been working through engineering study , technical school , which is now , i think , is a <unk> .
and i was in the <unk> years of the <unk> , <unk> to berlin because i wanted to leave renewable energy and there &apos;s not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of all the time , the <unk> was called <unk> .
the hot today is <unk> .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or <unk> .
but this is what kind of <unk> like the <unk> , which is a little hundred watts of the square meter of the square square meter .
and in berlin , it was a crazy thing .
i &apos;m the grateful grateful that he &apos;s going to <unk> the word again again because after the <unk> they didn &apos;t get the word word at all , because everything left was bad .
but the <unk> didn &apos;t have this in the 1930s .
there was a little bit of that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> where you &apos;d think evil .
the place of <unk> , but it was called <unk> and the solar and the solar system , and i started the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what was being told today , very , very , because many , many beautiful expressions of that was that i &apos;ve also been through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years in the collective of the collective .
we were 20 people .
if one of no said , if one of the <unk> was the <unk> , i &apos;ve got a 10 years , i was hard to make it <unk> , if i was my great <unk> , maybe i &apos;m hard to a <unk> thing , because all the colleagues of my father always have him <unk> .
it &apos;s related to the mercy .
and that was really very , very <unk> and you get into this kind of <unk> and a half in the place that was a picture of <unk> , where i asked 10 years , i was a <unk> at a collective <unk> , and whether it &apos;s really supposed to be like this .
and i was then <unk> , and then we &apos;ve got to be a <unk> of the company <unk> of the company that then <unk> along with friends , which then was <unk> along with one of the world &apos;s biggest <unk> of the world .
a <unk> , but we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have <unk> , a little group , decided that we &apos;re going to take a little group , and go back to the next topic , and that &apos;s what i think it &apos;s going to be like crazy , again , that people say , we &apos;re talking about .
and i &apos;ve brought you a project that i want to you now .
and the title of my presentation was how you get into a hundred percent .
and we just started to ask a relatively <unk> story , where could you do a memory in a way that could make a sense of a sense of a sense .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s a little thousand people living .
they have a renewables from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
that &apos;s just technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians , and i think the politicians , when they <unk> our <unk> .
so they always say why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent and seven percent and our net is the same european .
if we had 20 percent of europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island people who have the people on this island .
the question was simple , the way it was <unk> , first of the first contacts , but just as it was through .
how big would be a battery to be so a battery to be so a battery in 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 50 , maybe 70 percent .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back again .
the conventional system looks like this is the conventional system .
by the way , a year <unk> electric performance is about a <unk> <unk> on the world .
this is the power of a hundred nuclear nuclear power , because it &apos;s pretty fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s <unk> , which is being played with <unk> because you don &apos;t need it .
that &apos;s all the fast .
you &apos;re like this .
and then it &apos;s the rule that looks like this .
in the time , three of the <unk> , two are always waiting for two .
yeah , this is what you see is the burden .
we also have very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is the rule of a <unk> system or or a system that &apos;s just a small amount of things in the <unk> .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the <unk> is <unk> and the wind , the sun &apos;s <unk> , that they can map the major percentage of the world .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewables , so energy per year , not the performance of the time , then they need to turn the <unk> off .
that means , at the moment , they need to worry that the renewable renewable energy can take all the web .
and you can only see that if you &apos;re in some kind of way there are a <unk> .
so this is not done in the world so that .
so , there &apos;s a little bit of the little style , so you can also your car in your <unk> , a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what &apos;s going on in <unk> , because it &apos;s actually in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s already .
if you want to <unk> multiple of these <unk> , and they &apos;re supposed to build a network , it &apos;s going to be extremely complicated .
and our goal was to get rid of the age of 70 to the <unk> and then still the rest of the rest of the last 10 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent with that , is very , very expensive and it won &apos;t work out of batteries .
it &apos;s going to be an energy of an energy being , which is hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , that will be it .
you need to be more likely to go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we wanted to just know what is a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then a whole bunch of simulation did .
and then wind and the sun and the burden of <unk> and came to the conclusion , an exciting outcome , you know , that you could see the conventional system that you could take a <unk> <unk> about <unk> cents per <unk> .
that was the first calculations calculations six years .
and then we said , okay .
so , is great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if the average rate five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what would you have done everything ?
have helped investors , i &apos;ve looked new <unk> .
we were only at the time five people to build a society .
and here &apos;s another picture .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system , is our system .
that &apos;s the system that &apos;s also a <unk> , is because we &apos;re still 20 percent of <unk> and <unk> and also a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> wrote on the island , has been able to find that we &apos;re all pretty great .
but also , we don &apos;t believe you , but we don &apos;t believe you that can solve the technical problem .
and so we have chosen to build a hall in berlin , we &apos;re like the electric <unk> of the island of the island to three very three of the world .
that means we &apos;ve looked for the largest battery to find the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from from asia , in the fall of japan .
and <unk> is her in the &apos; 70s , at the &apos; 70s , at the <unk> <unk> , and then , then , <unk> , and then <unk> the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it &apos;s got a <unk> performance , and it can bring six hours long to this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we have to sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they set them up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , like it &apos;s in the hall in the hall , actually , in the hall , actually , the whole dynamic behavior of this web , so in the back , it &apos;s the <unk> , and the back is the whole big <unk> that we can simulate the web .
here &apos;s where we &apos;re going to simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to the sort of <unk> of the web .
and you can see this again again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> onto the net net .
so here we see this again again , again , again , again , the <unk> , individual <unk> .
and what we did was since the <unk> was the <unk> , so far as the <unk> of all the very big system , what &apos;s the <unk> system that was to develop electronics in software , software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the top , and the theme of the web , and it stands everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you can also communicate to the web , you can also communicate the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is that you can basically take anything that &apos;s the <unk> of the island , of problems that we will get when we increase our heritage of renewable renewables .
so this whole discussion of how will go at the moment and <unk> <unk> , like this , on the island , we have to go on the island of <unk> , for example , <unk> wind , so we <unk> the wind and the sun <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start on the island of the island to integrate the <unk> , <unk> , you can cause the load .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you don &apos;t get that without memory .
you can <unk> through the n of <unk> , you can , yes , you should fall in whatever you fall , the percentage of <unk> , but you never get on memory completely .
and that &apos;s the n of a little bit .
so , also , a lot of people are looking at that there &apos;s because you can see what &apos;s problems you get .
when we turn the gas off , you &apos;re not going to have a spinning mass of the same spinning , which is a kind of inertia of the web .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just <unk> masses of big <unk> wherever the wave around around the wave around the world around the entire world around the entire world .
we look at this web , which is the 50 hertz hertz , and if it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> hertz , we &apos;re going to start a little <unk> <unk> , then we &apos;ll get a little <unk> <unk> , then we &apos;ll get back again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly high .
if you take it in a while , it takes a little bit .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time , they can respond to them .
if you haven &apos;t got that anymore , this spinning mass , and then you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can actually put this big battery in two milliseconds .
there &apos;s already , you know , there &apos;s enormous <unk> there .
and the message is , we need to get to this rotating , we &apos;re going to be 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on , if we can do that .
then we need to break our <unk> capacity to the net .
<unk> is simply simply running the power power to keep the frequency .
yeah , that &apos;s a <unk> moment , <unk> <unk> , because we don &apos;t have to , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not going to be .
and we &apos;re just trying to make the capacity that the <unk> capacity , the <unk> capacity , by making a <unk> store into the net .
and there &apos;s also a lot of studies now .
and to that purpose , people come and look at our <unk> , sort of <unk> our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get there a piece of a way to <unk> .
and many discussions i had in the last six years , like the discussion i &apos;ve been in the last 30 years on the subject of the last 30 years .
don &apos;t go , there &apos;s no ear , <unk> , we &apos;ve never seen anything out of it .
we have 30 <unk> in germany today .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out of the next 30 and the same capacity for the next 30 years , the same capacity to <unk> <unk> all over the world .
just that , it will come .
there &apos;s so many kinds of <unk> there and arguments .
the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years now that the scientists are going to turn on my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million prescriptions of <unk> , and also to <unk> <unk> now to the german web .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so , from that , you know , there &apos;s a change in this change and just from this <unk> to the idea , and it &apos;s not going to be a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in arguments , these <unk> , these <unk> , who are <unk> , they have a very small web web , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is , if you &apos;re fully easy to do it , if you <unk> yourself , from some of the fossil or <unk> <unk> , which are <unk> in the world , and they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re an island .
then you use that , what &apos;s the sun and the wind there is there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> and <unk> energy , and i &apos;m grateful that they &apos;re told , the solar system is used .
and that &apos;s what we do , and this is the way we &apos;re going to come in , and this is the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you will be a collective and solar energy , a little bit of them together .
and i think , well , i want to just encourage you to make a little bit , and in the sense that you &apos;re going to be a little bit crazy and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty much more <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to .
thank you .
when steve lopez , he was <unk> in the middle hall times , one day ago , was through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless on a violin , who was just two strings .
many of you will know the story of history , because of <unk> articles , a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> , with robert <unk> junior , with robert <unk> junior , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> through his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he lived on the streets of <unk> row at the center of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all the way to read the reading book , or to look at the film , so she &apos;s not just the wonderful connection that between these two men , but also how they were being created this connection , and then they had the <unk> , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall hall .
he was just a clip of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and she came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> note about shame and hillary clinton and how the dodgers dodgers would never be able to do the baseball world would create the last sentence from beethoven &apos;s 2008 .
we went to talk music to music , and a few days later i got an email , who was in the condition of <unk> in me .
i still have to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already filled with electric electrical and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that he &apos;s tracked his whole whole life .
as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenics , and these are sometimes bad , and he would stop in the streets of <unk> row , always the horror and the <unk> of his own spirit .
and in fact , in fact , nathaniel <unk> was the nathaniel <unk> himself in the walt disney hall , and he started to <unk> this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and didn &apos;t lost this <unk> .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and smoke as he wanted to poison in his hands .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was scared that i could lose him that he could sink into one of his states and i could destroy him to the scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i started to play .
i was played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and while i was in the <unk> , i realized that in <unk> eyes was a complete shift .
it was like , as if it was a invisible impact , a chemical reaction to the impact of my game .
<unk> <unk> anger , in understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and started to play some of some of the clips of <unk> to play and asked me to play them , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , started by bach , and he &apos;s started to <unk> by bach and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he was not just a <unk> knowledge about music , but it also connected to her own a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with an passion and an understanding of that , i &apos;d like to know that from my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
by using music , and over music , was from this <unk> , confused man who was running around the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to be able to think of his thoughts and delusions with help of his imagination and creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that exactly this is what the hell of art is .
so this is the reason why we do music : we can do something that in all of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality that we &apos;ve got to do that is , and moved all the way and moved us .
and the nathaniel that brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him in a family of musicians who had his talent and it &apos;s <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to always be <unk> with nathaniel music , whether it &apos;s going to be walt disney , <unk> hall or <unk> row , because it reminds me why i was a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i &apos;d like to play the <unk> of the <unk> .
i hope you pardon me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what &apos;s a fish .
better , it was being used to <unk> after the <unk> of the <unk> standards .
so you might feel that it was to sell him to sell .
i had a relationship with this one relationship over several months .
one day , the head called the head of the company , and asked if i could give an event , over the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this is the enormous problem for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been the sea species we &apos;ve been burnt off by the forests .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , probably or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
many of the arguments that , <unk> pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , and they &apos;re inefficient , and a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
so , 15 lbs of <unk> is required to get a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , a company who was trying to do it right .
i wanted them to be supported .
the day before the event , i phoned the ceo of the <unk> for the company of the <unk> .
call it <unk> .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; don &apos;t care about the facts right , you &apos;re famous for this to grow out of the sea , so far out of the sea , you know the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish being distributed from our fish , not to be concentrated . &quot;
and then he added to , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> of <unk> is to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> one , great .
&quot; <unk> , one thing ? what do you do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and then i was in bed , and i thought , what is a sustainable protein ?
so i phoned the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t know .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t matter what to be sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know he . he &apos;ll just get me .
well , i &apos;m a <unk> with a few people in the company . no one could give me an answer , until i finally have to be <unk> with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; don &apos;t for example , &quot; what for example is sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , he &apos;s <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , potassium , and to make food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much is a lot of your <unk> <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in fact , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what is sustainable about fish to feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually got <unk> of this fish because , because , i swear to god , the fish that &apos;s after chicken after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the way you know better your fish , you know , you &apos;re your fish .
i was first eaten to eat him in a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had been talking for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came on the table with a bright , <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
stop twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste so well after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . it &apos;s actually called <unk> .
and no , he &apos;s got the fish not a chicken , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were raised <unk> on what wetlands were in the <unk> .
they made it by the country , by the land .
they built this complicated episode of these complicated , and they get rid of water from the land , and the <unk> in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it that worked , not economically .
and it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what are many birds .
and this is what happened in 1982 , with green , the country , bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow flow of the water .
they literally have the levers of the lever .
instead of the water , they used to use the water channels to <unk> the water back .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a <unk> in <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp -- and they have <unk> and his company , the ecological destruction , completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something else .
they stare out on the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away , and everything you see these are <unk> channels and these density , lush , lush .
i was not there before , not a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three of them , three of the darwin and a piece of &quot; a crocodile . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and fought us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> it in calm a <unk> .
here &apos;s a rare <unk> of <unk> .
now , he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here he is , here he sees a pattern of <unk> , which is the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has the greatest part of his career national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national
i asked him how he became so a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes away and <unk> himself in <unk> birds and algae and <unk> and weird <unk> .
and not that understanding of me was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , like this .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was , and my head was a <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had at the <unk> .
so i cut it off . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it come as well that your fish are so good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what &apos;s eating your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that fish eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> of the biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
later on day , i was a lot of on this site with <unk> around the day and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that &apos;s so , &quot; unlike every farm , i was like , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a <unk> must have a <unk> .
and we took around the road and you take the incredible sight , thousands and thousands of <unk> , a literally <unk> carpet carpet that literally is enough to make .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> birds for the birds .
well , last year , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one today , and one of the most important private community of <unk> in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> <unk> , the last you want to have to have a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not hard .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the <unk> , the gut , the better . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s turn this . a farm that &apos;s not fed up with the animal , and a farm that &apos;s their success in the health of their predators .
but a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> from the beginning , not even there .
they breed in a city &apos;s 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , they &apos;re going to go 240 miles to farm every morning .
and every night , they &apos;re going to go 240 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re the <unk> white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had a kind of trip of the penguins , so i looked at the <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , flies , flying <unk> miles on the farm and then you go next to 40 miles back at the evening ?
do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me , as i was just a <unk> of whitney at the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you can do that because it &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved -- the delicious was , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m never going to go almost not to do it .
and yet , when i try to try and do it in this restaurant in <unk> , you didn &apos;t have to go to <unk> <unk> .
she liked sweet and it &apos;s like you &apos;d take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to the <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last <unk> , before something is in the body .
she has evolved in the evolution of the evolution , so <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that &apos;s not running their fish . a farm that affects their success , they were success .
and then i realized when he says a farm that has no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because the water that comes through those farm comes from the river in the stream .
it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s going to lead all the things that rivers tend to tend to lead them to , chemical pollutants , the flow of <unk> .
and when it &apos;s been working through the system , and this is the water &apos;s cleaner , as it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that &apos;s not feeding her animals , not only one farm that &apos;s their success in the health , but a farm that &apos;s literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but it &apos;s also for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> in the atlantic .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should also do it , because these love , like , romantic , like the romantic , is also <unk> .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good foods , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , which is actually good , in the foods in the foods .
but for a lot of people &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about local food . we &apos;re eating .
and if you say that things are the things that the future is good at anyone somewhere up , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> , but how will they feed the world ?
how are they feeding the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re enough calories to produce enough , to the world more than to feed the world .
one billion people are going to be hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our <unk> last 50 years .
so the grain of herbivores , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken fish , chicken , and the whole time , the <unk> simply has to feed , &quot; if we &apos;re more people cheaper to the <unk> , how is it ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the easy . it was the business of the american farming .
we should call them what she is , an <unk> in <unk> , an <unk> , which is <unk> fast capital <unk> , which is that this production is enabled .
this is not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is not being threatened by <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources , but because of the <unk> resource .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile country , not by pumps , but through fresh water , it &apos;s not through pumps , but by fresh water , but not to do with fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are able to feed each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> of the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> in the <unk> and never make it a little good to eat .
so let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the fact that it &apos;s been under two billion years of <unk> .
look at the <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
businesses that are not in the worlds for themselves , we are in <unk> , who are creating instead of <unk> , businesses , the <unk> , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts who are willing to taste for flavor .
and if i really was honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be honest .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good foods , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to you today , you want to <unk> one thing , that &apos;s the whole time of data that we consume , greater than the sum of the parts and instead of thinking about <unk> , i want to think you think about how we can &apos;t be visible .
so what we see here is a typical <unk> age after age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain amount of cause , we &apos;re accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people are most active and they &apos;re over here .
we can go out one step further and see the data and see the data then and see that <unk> and cancer , are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
if we &apos;re going to go on and age as old , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the key thing to make people worry about .
and the <unk> is that this is particularly true in men .
so you see that this is from information and data in this way in this way in a living <unk> reminds of a living <unk> .
and if we do this for raw data , why do not even do this for content ?
so what we &apos;ve now got here is the <unk> of each one &apos;s single time , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my favorite presentation in your <unk> .
and with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
they can dive into a particular year .
you can just jump into a certain <unk> .
now , if i look at this , i see the athlete that appear in this game and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click on all the time i &apos;ll show you all the time , armstrong &apos;s going to show me all the time .
now , if i want to just an <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all the theme of the theme of the theme of the theme ? &quot;
so i go back to step and <unk> .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> <unk> , and , you don &apos;t look at this or not just not just not just not .
you make something that &apos;s actually slightly different .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
i want to start this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we have every single <unk> of <unk> and you get into a little summary .
the summary of the short of the domain has a short , and a symbol of the domain of which you come .
i just give the top 500 of the top <unk> .
but even in that , we can see a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the topics that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote the issue .
well , after i chose to &apos; government , i realize the <unk> that &apos;s most time <unk> , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a very compelling thing that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to recognize if you look back and you &apos;re looking at this .
so , in a particular one of these , i can then integrate the theme of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; people of the year , &quot; in the year , and everyone together .
now , if i look at all these guys , i see that the majority of these guys are <unk> , some of the science come from science . some , even less , coming out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono also is a ted prize .
so we can jump and take a look at all the ted prize .
you can see , we &apos;re <unk> the first time as though it &apos;s really a net , not just from side to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what could be a little bit of the surprise .
i &apos;m going to show you the new york times a half times .
<unk> , this app -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see the websites that you &apos;re looking at -- and we put them to each one of the individual website like this .
so i can go back to step directly and stare straight to a specific <unk> .
so this is why you just go through the image of the way you &apos;re looking through the way websites in this way , the whole <unk> in the same way .
so i can zoom in my process in a certain time in a certain time .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been held up to this way .
and i can sort of <unk> everything i looked at today .
and when i turn back to a step , and i can probably put my new <unk> to this new column , maybe i &apos;ve been looking for the <unk> &apos; <unk> , and here , after <unk> , or here , is the live of <unk> , or here , right here , right here .
and i can go into the site and you &apos;re going to go back to them .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used to be used again , and every time it makes the greater big greater than the sum of the <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that &apos;s data to be a <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; <unk> . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and the internet is going to be the internet , so that we instead of getting one another instead of one to go to the other , i can go from a lot of things to go and go out patterns that would otherwise otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do this , then this is going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and instead of just moving into information , we can know , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we can experience , we can even pull ourselves out , maybe we can even pull out .
i hear that , thank you very much .
i was growing with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school , every day an hour , an hour , an hour .
and my nose always had always been in a book , a <unk> , which is my thought in other worlds and <unk> in a <unk> way of my deep in <unk> , voracious curiosity .
and this curiosity showed up that i was like , i &apos;m always going to be in school through the forest , through the forests , and the samples of &quot; collected , frogs and snakes and snakes and snakes and herbs and <unk> , and under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it always went to the attempt to understand the world and the limits of the potential of potential .
and my love science fiction seemed to be a bit like in my environment , because the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living rooms with his amazing shows that we were animals and places and a world of wonder we had never had to imagine .
and i think that &apos;s all the way that the <unk> is all right .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video games nor these <unk> <unk> , the whole of the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we had to all the time . when we read as a children , we took the description of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> in our heads .
my response to that was the drawing and painting of aliens , alien robots , robots , <unk> and all the way .
in the <unk> i &apos;ve been constantly caught by the teacher , i like to hidden in the textbook , hidden textbook .
the creativity had to hold hold .
and what happened was something interesting . what was <unk> <unk> shows by <unk> shows , was the idea of an unknown world here on our earth .
i certainly would ever achieve a alien world to make a space , which seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk in , on earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic as all the things that i had to imagined as i was imagined that when i read these books .
so i decided i was 15 to become a diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , and they were just on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my ph.d. in a pool of the <unk> in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
the ocean &apos;s ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later on the face of california , when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , i have the <unk> , i &apos;ve got about three hours underwater , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> oceans , as rich as rich is life , is how we really can &apos;t imagine .
the only minds of nature doesn &apos;t know , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
until the day i feel the deepest awe for the thing i see on my back .
and my love for the ocean holds , with the same intensity as ever as it ever .
when i was an adult , i was a profession , it was the filmmaking .
it seemed the best way to get my inner urge to tell stories with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew books all the time .
so , movies of the way , images and stories are going to bring together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m <unk> from the <unk> : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so , in fact , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to be a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we did <unk> animation , <unk> , back to <unk> animation , back .
so what came out was the first <unk> <unk> of the ones who ever had in a movie .
the film doesn &apos;t take a money , right , exactly he was going to play it , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was how <unk> the magic was <unk> from it .
according to arthur clarke , the law is , you know , <unk> technology and magic .
so you saw something magic .
and that was incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what you need to be in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator , &quot; my next film , even a lot of people .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success depended on it , what this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we have a little bit more money on the movie .
from those two experiences , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my good friend , <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> of the best <unk> and <unk> she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
so the basic idea of this company was that we could make the phase of the processes with visual printers , and to skip and to start with digital <unk> .
so that &apos;s what we did , and we kind of have a <unk> advantage .
but the middle of the 1990s we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we were actually created -- and we had started to <unk> .
i had this piece called &quot; avatar &quot; that makes the <unk> <unk> effects , and <unk> effects in new altitudes , with regard to considerable human , expressive characters that were made by <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar that took quite nice to , and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to do a <unk> , not to do that .
so i took this and made this other film about the big ship that will come .
the <unk> i have to be as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became a <unk> of magnitude , a very keen scale , a very keen film .
but i wanted to really wanted to the real <unk> of the titanic .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know it .
i think they &apos;ve been persuaded them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re diving up to the <unk> . we &apos;re going to film the real <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is immensely important . it &apos;s a good marketing marketing marketing .
and i persuaded them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is what it goes back to that the imagination can be a reality .
and we created six months later , a reality that i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was the actual titanic through a <unk> .
it was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really has me .
and the thing that we were getting is huge . we had to put cameras and <unk> and <unk> and all kinds of things .
and i fell on , like very , very , very , very , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and more sophisticated planning planning .
you go up in those capsule , then you &apos;re in these dark , <unk> environments where no hope is to save a hope to make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like me in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from the part of the part that i do with curiosity and science has been doing it . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was curiosity .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give it hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a character that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t see what i could see outside of the <unk> .
so i &apos;ve seen some of the following expeditions i &apos;ve seen in <unk> , and sometimes things that i haven &apos;t seen before , sometimes things that had seen before no one had seen before , and the science at time we saw it had no words .
so that &apos;s got me right , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met a little bit unusual .
after success , i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on hollywood on the ice and then become a while <unk> . &quot;
and then we started to <unk> the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they were explored with <unk> .
we went to the wreckage of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was , <unk> and seeing the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody had ever explored the inside of the <unk> , and you had no means for it . so we developed the technology .
so , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see , <unk> , these <unk> , and see these <unk> here , and i know that once the band has been played out there .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the spine of the ship .
i &apos;m not <unk> it &apos;s just , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle .
it felt like i was in the <unk> of the titanic war .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner , i always know what the <unk> of the vehicle would like to be in the vehicle , since we turned the film .
the set was a complete copy of the design of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me that <unk> that you use such a <unk> <unk> and so consciousness in the vehicle , in the other form of existence , in the other form of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little bit of a view of what might happen in a few decades when you have a <unk> , to explore something or explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> , i can imagine as a <unk> .
after that we started these expeditions , we started what we saw at the bottom of the bottom , really , for example , these amazing animals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are like aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help by <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight , how we do that .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees celsius they can survive .
at the same time i was interested in a very <unk> , and i was a very <unk> , back to my childhood , and my childhood was from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who care about space and nasa , and in the <unk> , and right <unk> , they &apos;re in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they go to russia , through the mission of the <unk> protocol , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took <unk> with us in the deep sea .
i took them to the <unk> access to the world , <unk> them , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme extreme situations , i took them to take samples and instruments and instruments so on and so on .
we made it in , but actually , but science , but actually , i was <unk> .
so the circle of my existence as a <unk> , at the time , as a child , and the implementation in the reality .
so in the course of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot of learning .
i learned a lot about science . but i think you can also have a director to go and have a guide , a guide , like a <unk> or something .
i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i before these <unk> <unk> .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to come out ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t take us a cash .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of a time . of fame .
everyone thinking i was between &quot; the titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; <unk> and then put me on the beach on a towel .
i &apos;ve all these films , these were making these films , for a very small audience .
no , no honor , no . no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the problem , to the challenge , and the ocean is the most important environment that there is . you &apos;re doing it because of the <unk> connection that comes out , when a small group of people have a team .
because we &apos;ve only worked all this with 10 to 12 people working for years that worked in the years , sometimes we were two to three months in a row at sea .
and in this community , you see that the most important thing is the idea of the proton , which you have before you have a job that you have a job of being able to tell anyone else .
if you go back to shore and says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and all around the world , the difficulty that the human <unk> , and the difficulty that the human <unk> is working on the sea , then you can &apos;t explain it .
there &apos;s a connection that comes together , each other respect .
so when i came back to the next film , my next film is to turn the avatar , i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you get a team and committed to the return of it .
so it &apos;s got the dynamic really changes .
so there was a little team over the <unk> terrain . we made the avatar , &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technique that we haven &apos;t been there before .
so incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we &apos;ve been to a <unk> for a time of four and a half years ago .
and it &apos;s changed my way to make films , completely .
there were people who thought we were really good at these <unk> of really good <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more like a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome of the outcome .
so what can we end up with all of that ?
what lessons from we learned ?
i think that &apos;s the way that curiosity does .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of the team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
and to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me an advice , like i can . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t you even have a <unk> yourself .
and you know , it &apos;s going to be different for you . don &apos;t do you , don &apos;t necessarily bet against himself . &quot;
nasa has such a <unk> : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in art and the study and the study has got to be an alternative , because there is a <unk> .
no important endeavor , the innovation demanded , has been the risk of risk .
you need to be willing to take those risks .
so that &apos;s the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way , failure is absolutely an alternative , fear , but not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
and this is surprising to maybe because my <unk> is mainly , because my <unk> is actually around vaccines and seed seed , and we need to invent the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , actually actually more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that the <unk> is not growing over many years , and it &apos;s too much . we can rain , and the things will change as it can &apos;t withstand its cold environment .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to a <unk> .
so , is a climate change terrible for them .
and also the <unk> for them is very important .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of one thing , the <unk> would be energy by far energy .
well , the <unk> is over time .
in fact , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> was the industrial revolution , and even in the twentieth century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> and therefore we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s meet the price of half -- we &apos;re going to meet a new barrier and these barrier is <unk> .
co2 is <unk> the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> carbon , which is going to lead to the <unk> of the <unk> and these <unk> , effects on the weather and maybe worse , the <unk> episode that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t evolve and so whole systems .
now the exact relationship between a <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where they &apos;re all effects are there , there are some of them , but not a lot .
and there &apos;s certain ambiguity of how bad these are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we have to really get down to get to zero ?
don &apos;t you have half a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : we &apos;re close to zero , the temperature will continue to rise up .
so it &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s all different than to say , we have a <unk> high truck that has to bridge under a three of three feet a bridge to bridge , and then you can actually put it underneath it .
this is not going to have to lower , right here .
well , we &apos;re running a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons of tons .
every american is about 20 tons of people in poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of everyone on the planet .
and somehow we need to produce changes that will be down to zero .
it &apos;s all the way up .
only different economic changes have been influenced at all , and we need to go from <unk> increase , and to get to one reduction in order to get to zero .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to be the number of people depend on the <unk> of the service that every person in the average uses of the service that every person is using .
so let &apos;s just take one factor of an example , and we think we &apos;re going to be a big one .
probably one of those numbers have to be very close to zero .
now this is a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
first of all , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people , the same thing .
and it &apos;s going to spend on the end of the day , and it &apos;s going to move over to nine billion cars .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are , we could probably probably be about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope about 1.3 .
the second factor are the services we use .
so , that &apos;s all the foods that we eat eating clothing , television , <unk> heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means to make these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
in the rich world , in the upper billion billion , we could make it <unk> and less , but on average , that number of each year gets up , and more than twice the services , the number of services are being placed in a person .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s home to go home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in terms of efficiency , the energy supply service service , there is finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going to go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods in the <unk> , there are many services to the energy of 90 percent .
in other service , like the <unk> , <unk> 4 : <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; lt ; 7 : 4 : <unk> or the <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement .
in fact , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might be able to get a factor of three or three or maybe a factor of a factor of three .
but the first three factors we &apos;re going to do is we now 70 billion billion tons of tons of <unk> , and that just simply not .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key to co2 -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s asking if you can get it to a zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every carbon atoms are electricity for electricity <unk> nowadays , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do is to make a global level , is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i use the term , i mean , i &apos;m not the impossible to do the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer &apos;s computer is a miracle .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there &apos;s no time you need a miracle to a given a given a given a little bit .
usually you &apos;re just wrong , and some of them are not , other ones .
so in this case , we have to be <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered how can i really get to the market ?
there &apos;s a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s what people are here ?
i remember last year when i was killing the mosquitoes , and kind of liked the people that are .
the idea was really , you know , there &apos;s people who have to do with mosquitos that live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here .
i decided that that would be out of fireflies , from the most <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here &apos;s some natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve got to tell me that they don &apos;t bite . you &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get much much .
we need to have solutions either or several things that have a tremendous scale and unimaginable for a lot of directions where people are looking for looking for , i can just see five that big demands .
i have a tides , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
and this may be a <unk> piece of contribution and if you &apos;re better than i expect , it would be great , but my graph is that we need to give them all those five work , and we can &apos;t give them from them because all the common problems have been significant problems .
so let &apos;s take the look fossil fuels from <unk> fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you need to do is maybe just , maybe , but it &apos;s not . you have to get rid of all the co2 that burning out after burning , the pressure of the <unk> and then hope that there is it there .
there are some <unk> that will be on 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it will be very hard to get very hard , and it &apos;s a <unk> of the carbon <unk> . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who is going to make it make sure ?
who are literally able to guarantee what &apos;s literally a lot of billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot .
so this is a hard problem .
next : <unk> .
and the also has three big problems : the cost , particularly in <unk> countries are high . the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human being in the fuel .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because , although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work with that .
the last three of the five is i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables of energy as they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , although it &apos;s great , you have no fuel -- you have some disadvantages .
and the density is the density that these technologies are generating dramatically decrease as the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times more than a normal power station .
and also , these vent <unk> are happening .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be , and also , the wind is not constantly the <unk> .
so you have to be , if you &apos;re on these sources , you have a way of the energy that &apos;s even more available in times if you &apos;re not available to you .
so there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges with the transmission of transmission . if we say that the power is the energy outside the country , you don &apos;t have the technology , you have to deal with the risk of energy where the energy comes from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all made of all kinds of batteries that are made of , look , the people , computers , mobile phones , for everything , and that i &apos;ve used to the amount of electronic energy that we could make less than 10 minutes of the <unk> store .
so we need a big breakthrough , something that will be 100 to 100 better than the way that a factor of 100 will be better than the way that we can .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources of sources of <unk> sources , 30 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest .
if you want to rely on 100 percent of them , they need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of .
in each of these five areas , we need to take least 100 people .
so , in many , you &apos;re going to say that they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of ted in ted group there that are already engaged in there .
bill has several companies , several companies , including a <unk> , <unk> has the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies doing the great stuff and interesting opportunities and i try to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;m funding a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach is actually tracked .
there &apos;s some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped a while , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the <unk> means that you &apos;re in a part of the <unk> , one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you had a long time thinking about it , but you could never make reasonable simulate whether it &apos;s going to work , but there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yeah !
and because you burn it , it &apos;s the <unk> that &apos;s much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a <unk> .
instead of getting it to the head , they &apos;re just going to burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
so this is going to take a little bit of incremental , a bit like a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of column that often refer to the &quot; <unk> wave . &quot;
that &apos;s really what really does the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that &apos;s 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned down today , so <unk> uranium .
the <unk> <unk> for hundreds of years .
and if you get <unk> , and you get <unk> , you get enough propellant for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward to come forward .
let &apos;s think how we measure our success .
what should we look at what ?
well , we &apos;re going to go to the goal we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many of the talks about one 80 percent reduction in 2050 by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent are being created in poor countries , and still , again , something that &apos;s going to be <unk> and cement , and cement , and cement .
so to get these 80 percent , the developed countries have to be developed , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note , if we &apos;re using the technology technology , if you &apos;re in all developed countries , whether it &apos;s used to be used in all of countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is a key key to this <unk> .
if we go back from here , what should determine the global ?
it &apos;s got to put the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to get to reducing reducing the way , the less we &apos;re going to be less <unk> , the less <unk> , and it also is the temperature .
but actually , this note is the thing that we companies that don &apos;t fully lead to the big <unk> of the big <unk> , just the same , or even something less important , what the <unk> is the <unk> of innovation .
so these breakthroughs have to go with <unk> and we can measure that in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that &apos;s on this topic .
al gore book , &quot; we have the election , &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy <unk> the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through and creating a framework that &apos;s been going to be discussing the way , because we need to need for all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of that wish .
this is what the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the <unk> will be between long and in the long term , and in the way china and china , between poor and rich , and nearly all live , and nearly all live in those two billion are very much bad .
so what do we need to do ?
so what do things do i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like <unk> , they should not only talk about carbon .
they should talk about these <unk> and they were shocked by the <unk> of the <unk> of this innovative way that we spent innovative ways .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; d is something that creates a <unk> .
we need to spread the news .
we need to dialogue , and the whole thing that &apos;s going to do is to go and get the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
so thank you very much . just to understand something better -- you can give us a picture of the magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : the simulation on a supercomputer , all big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need some 10 million , and even if we have our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure to make sure that it &apos;s sensible to the <unk> .
the hard step is building the first <unk> to another <unk> , and the place of the actually actually building the first one of the reality .
once the first time is done , if it &apos;s like promised , then it &apos;s all clear because the economic density is so different as a <unk> , as we know you .
so to make that right , that means deep in the ground , is deep in the ground , like a vertical column nuclear <unk> , that <unk> , and then the process up and it &apos;s going to work on the bottom ?
<unk> : right . now you have to <unk> the reactor &apos;s the reactor &apos;s time , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong , and this thing where you open it and things like it &apos;s open and things like it &apos;s open .
if you have a very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you think of a column that she bury , without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s been going to be 60 years , and it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which is a solution for the garbage to give the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now what happens to the waste : you can sit in the seats -- there &apos;s a lot less trash with this technique -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that &apos;s already there that exists in these <unk> or <unk> in these reactors . this is our <unk> .
so what these reactors is a problem for these reactors , what we do in our business and it will dramatically reduce dramatically .
but while you &apos;ve been talking about different people around the world , there &apos;s been about these options .
where is the biggest interest in what really does ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t been a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear &quot; nuclear , and there &apos;s been a lot of interest and the people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve talked about how this fits the <unk> and talk about how this fits the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something that &apos;s done in the direction .
this is a different thing that was done .
this is a more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a <unk> reactor and some countries have built this , therefore , everybody who has done a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your mind , you &apos;re living in the idea of that time and probability that really ?
<unk> : well we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , and we &apos;ve <unk> 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
so this is the <unk> that &apos;s demonstrated that we need to have to have the <unk> of the <unk> .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of companies that work , the <unk> , the developing world , which is going to be able to <unk> for their pilots .
and it would be best if it can do several , because then you could use a blend .
but we need a solution to the case .
and then the great thing about breakthroughs is this is the biggest thing that you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important .
it would be without the <unk> , but it &apos;s still so much more important .
in the world &apos;s nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how much as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that &apos;s kind of hard , but maybe you &apos;re telling the that &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty is that a <unk> one million times so much energy , we say , a <unk> and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and these are the <unk> radiation , and these are the <unk> radiation , and they &apos;re mostly the radiation , and they &apos;re basically the radiation , and they &apos;re basically the radiation , and they &apos;re basically the radiation , and they &apos;re basically the radiation , and they &apos;re basically the radiation , and they &apos;re basically the radiation ,
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to get <unk> to try to make the stable stable , the stable stable to keep the stable stable ?
<unk> : if you come to this situation , it &apos;s like you too much ate too much , and you &apos;re short in a heart attack . what do you do ? you need a <unk> or something like that .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is called the various techniques to <unk> the warming , so we 20 years or 30 years longer .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t be on insurance because you might be a lazy lazy , so you can get rid of you because you know that one will save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if the smart is , if you &apos;re going to be the importance of this problem in front of your problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in <unk> , whether you get faster , if things will come faster , or more than we expect .
<unk> : have a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics is very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
tell me that there &apos;s a negative impact that has to do with the clouds that are going to move things ?
there &apos;s very , very few things that you can tell at all that you can tell you about that , from which there is a chance in a million .
so the <unk> here is the same thing as aids .
you make the mistakes , and you pay for a lot of it .
and so the idea , now , if you have all sorts of problems , if you have all sorts of problems , you &apos;ve got to invest in something that you &apos;ve got to -- and then you have people in the rich world , the ipcc report not necessarily as clear the worst scenario and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that when you can make it , and the co2 is going down , then the co2 goes down , saying the skeptics , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter that it was not a carbon <unk> , i wish it was cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> of the argument that if you &apos;re all the time and energy that &apos;s been using the co2 problem , all the other goals of the suffering , all the other goals , the <unk> , which is the driving waste of malaria and so on .
<unk> : well , the actual spending is spending 10 billion per year more than you are spending the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year than you do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t be suffering from other things .
you then go to big <unk> , and there &apos;s a reasonable people can disagree with if you have something that &apos;s not in the economic , and it &apos;s trying to finance . &quot;
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short in a short <unk> and <unk> just learning the learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much less .
if the <unk> you get , a very high <unk> is just a high school , then you can only keep the rich up .
i mean , each of us could be here for five times to change so much for our energy spend without changing its lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking about .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why are the research going on ? &quot;
it &apos;s still still because of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group , and therefore he does it now .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think for appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , just like the supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk for almost all the people here , if i say , i &apos;m hoping that you will be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> is to the largest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> structure , about a <unk> <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and it really seems to be really easy , it &apos;s actually hard because it &apos;s people &apos;s working very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a <unk> .
it was a big success .
since i &apos;ve been done about 70 workshops in the world with students , engineers and architects , architects , architects , even with the problem , which is deep , which is deep , which is the deep nature of collaboration and i want some of them with them .
usually the most people are getting to get to the job of the task .
they talk about it , they think what it is going to look like , they &apos;re <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . she &apos;s <unk> and put spaghetti sauce .
they invest in a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk> of the time .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow and you put it on top of the top , step back and put it on top , step back and <unk> .
but what &apos;s going to happen is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is to a <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , because the weight of the <unk> is able to do it and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more <unk> than others , and under the worst , <unk> <unk> .
they lie , they &apos;re <unk> and actually making a <unk> shapes .
and of course , of course , there &apos;s much more &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and under the best , <unk> student <unk> , and under the best , <unk> student .
and this is quite amazing .
as we did peter , it makes not just the highest towers towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how does this matter ? why ? what ? what is that ?
and peter tells me , &quot; don &apos;t get the kids spend a lot of time to the spaghetti sauce of the spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re training , they were trained to find a real plan , ok .
and it &apos;s not that .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens to happen ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
does sound mean what ?
what &apos;s <unk> in the other way that they start with the marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they would have been <unk> prototypes to repair prototypes .
<unk> is the kind of collaboration as a result of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every trial that children get instant feedback will work and what &apos;s not .
so the performance working with prototypes , is a lot of -- but we see how different teams are acting .
the average average of most is about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , lawyers , lawyers , but not much , more than the adult .
who is the most successful successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately , fortunately .
three times the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometrical patterns are the key to build a stable structure .
ceos &apos;s a little about average , but here &apos;s what &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put an <unk> administrator on the team , they &apos;re significant better .
it &apos;s amazing . you see it and you can see it &apos;s a team . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they run the process , they understand it .
and this team that &apos;s going to fall in the work is the performance of the teams of the teams significant .
and these are specialized skills and <unk> and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing you get , you get about six , the allies have a strong structure .
i was trying to do something .
i thought we &apos;ll let the <unk> right now .
so i offered a <unk> for the software for software .
what do you think about these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone could built a <unk> high construction , it would have the prize home .
so , is it not interesting that high <unk> have a strong effect ?
we &apos;ve got these exercise with the same students .
what do you think ?
now , she understood the benefit of the &quot; confidence . &quot;
so , that made a bad team of one under the best .
it &apos;s powered by the time in the time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us to think about nature of the desire and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually invest in the time a <unk> ?
the reason i &apos;m able to help digital tools and processes to help , to help , to help , cars , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> is doing , they &apos;re very hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a common language , or <unk> , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this is such simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they &apos;re going to find crazy examples of all the world , like people to optimize the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is , actually , this is an construction sport , is a sport .
it requires that we all all our senses in the problem and we think that we use our thinking of how our emotions and our do , in the challenge that we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes us to us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we &apos;d like to do a machine here .
so a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i mean , because i left my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s looking for the superstar .
i don &apos;t know .
i think that you &apos;re sort of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to not have the past , and it &apos;s because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because of the planet , you don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to do this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we have ever had on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , declining opportunities , declining <unk> .
there was never before a time .
my family <unk> died all the time they were 60 .
my grandparents had this number of <unk> .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there &apos;s better at a beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not time people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born today is being born in new delhi , as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve been <unk> the demographics of the earth &apos;s way , like it didn &apos;t have war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . pop .
in the wealthy world there are diseases that millions of us are still not even threatened by one generation , barely .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anyone know anybody else , what that is that ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are the success method .
and from my view , the scientific method , things like to do things , if it works , it &apos;s going to change if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humankind .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements and a billion people on this world every day hungry hungry .
and that number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not just that , we &apos;ve used to use our imagination to <unk> this world .
drinking drinking land , rainforests , rainforests , gas : they &apos;re disappearing , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t come from that mess , we &apos;ll go away .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live , to rape .
i think we can bring this world with energy that they don &apos;t fully destroyed at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , it &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that i think is awake at night . we &apos;ve never been so much as much as it now , never , it &apos;s not just as much as it now , nor was .
and we were also never able to do it , it &apos;s how we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many realms , and yet i think we can hundreds of hundreds of years before the enlightenment to go back to find a time that we have gotten in these things that are <unk> right now .
people are <unk> in their belief , so they &apos;re so tightly , they &apos;re not going to be free .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right to his mind ; even a pretty much in his sense of progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t have quite a pretty much on their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to find out .
so , a decade ago , i have a article about <unk> for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed at the resistance of the <unk> , the <unk> toward what the most effective is in health in the history of mankind is in the history of mankind .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i was just what i was doing , i did a <unk> and went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about food change .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote this article on this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would people thought that would be the molecules that would be the molecules in a certain rather than random kind of <unk> .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re eating food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s because these claims that i didn &apos;t even have had any angry .
these were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that &apos;s what i got so <unk> ...
but then i thought , you know what we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic of this , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s why , and i think we know what are reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes in the science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people who we believed they were right . so are they &apos;re <unk> .
ask questions , ask evidence , they ask evidence .
take nothing to be .
but now , it &apos;s : if you get the evidence you need to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at all .
and i can say that we live in an epidemic of fear , as i never seen , and i hope you never see , hopefully never .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that had been published with the measles of the column with the column , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
in fact , researchers were conducted by seeing whether that was true .
in fact , researchers should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from the sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we think what we see is really feeling that we &apos;re feeling real .
we don &apos;t think about a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> that &apos;s data , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re all going to do that .
but you know what ?
the result was devastating .
because the fact is devastating because the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world that are <unk> for them to grow up for the <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because does anybody have been ?
have a single in the audience , ever see a guy die ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country , not , but then , in this country , then , in the last year , there &apos;s last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because this is not here , we can do it , we can be in denial , and people like <unk> , and messages from <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and larry king live .
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect the cause and you &apos;re not going to connect .
they don &apos;t understand that things seem to be equally , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he &apos;s <unk> us from one of the worst human human &apos;s worst human .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he has just evolved with a couple of other people &apos;s developed .
he can save the lives of <unk> , and 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , except paul walking around paul and you talk about vaccines , and that says , how do they stop .
and that &apos;s actually saying that .
paul is a terrorist .
when paul comes in a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell without armed with <unk> .
he gets to get calls home because people like to tell him that you know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , they go , they go into terrible diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we have now been <unk> in this country .
and that &apos;s worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because that &apos;s just one question of the numbers .
and they &apos;re not only dying of dying .
what &apos;s the <unk> ? take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me gave me a couple of weeks ago , and i said , she &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
nobody has ever said that .
she wouldn &apos;t be saved for <unk> . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe every time , every morning , somebody would come in an airplane and fly in a plane , at the moment he &apos;s on ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he &apos;s going to go to long beach , and he &apos;ll go to one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a disease &apos;s disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is the world &apos;s going to work .
this is the planet that we live . don &apos;t it like it as if it &apos;s not .
we love it to lie in the face . we love that .
did you all have their vitamins , all the vitamins ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that gives you to the lift .
i know that they &apos;ve done that , because half of the americans that make it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is that the time we have this time .
they &apos;re in their urine . they never do anything .
this is okay , you want to be 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have any trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care is the way .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and <unk> itself can afford to us .
so we &apos;re walking away , and where do we go ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious matter because it &apos;s crap , and we spend billions dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i tell that people , i &apos;m going to people tell me , &quot; what does it matter ? let people do what they want .
so , you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to be the case of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
if you go to that way , where does believe and magic evidence and science , will get it to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 to his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs , we know that they can shorten the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of death in a country that &apos;s worse than any other is <unk> by any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
well , the <unk> epidemic we &apos;re now is in , is this <unk> battle between the <unk> &apos;s genetically foods and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s the ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , has changed .
you know , there were no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we did this .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 200 years .
and some of it has work , and it &apos;s not .
we &apos;re eating , what &apos;s not going to work .
now we can do it more precisely . and of course , there &apos;s risks . but we can do something like vitamin a <unk> , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i have to say i &apos;m not going to understand that .
we also neglect food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is , a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , <unk> , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want to have companies to have life .
we don &apos;t want to that companies have seeds .
and you know what &apos;s my answer to all this is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
so this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s quite , morality , <unk> .
you know , the science is not a company .
she &apos;s not land .
she &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do work because we &apos;ve scared millions of people from the <unk> .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? food has changed .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like the <unk> .
so , the name is something that &apos;s a half billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a <unk> calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrients , it &apos;s got no protein , and scientists , all this just at it .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to that is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to <unk> ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> of food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about people alive to get people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re so far as we have so much guilty about something that we do , i think , not guilty , <unk> .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish ; it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to stop it .
so , after this incredibly funny , you want to say , &quot; you want to be in this ridiculous time , &quot; you &apos;re still going into this ridiculous time and going into the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
now , in the moment you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put that time on everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want them to , and we will move them to where we want to .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time , and we &apos;re going to be happy to the future , we &apos;re glad that made .
i know that we can , and it &apos;s where it &apos;s about to me , is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , and it may seem strange that one magician is interested in , it &apos;s because , you think it &apos;s like a magician that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a real time , if someone is stuck . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have shown a measurable effect , the <unk> , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to you , is a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , if the patient is only found , you know the <unk> effect .
a delusion is to something , because somebody is so much .
so let &apos;s understand each other , i want to understand you now , a basic magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has been at least since the 1950s in every child &apos;s children .
i even have him from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the 1970s in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and it &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m going to explain .
so , you see what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m going to hold the knife just as my own .
i &apos;m going to push my sleeves .
and to make sure that nothing is in my body , or from him , i &apos;m just going to just <unk> my wrist right here .
you can see that there &apos;s no time to get anything moving , as long as i can &apos;t move here , can &apos;t go into my sleeve .
and the goal is just simply .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all the good , is going to be the knife by my bare physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually the same thing in his space that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes up with my body or is it out , no <unk> . and you can study it .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often think of young children who are interested in magic , because you can see a lot of about deception , if it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
probably many of you here in the room here in the room .
it &apos;s like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to <unk> my wrist , to make sure that nothing is in my sleeve , or get out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m <unk> my wrist is the fact that there &apos;s the actual secret secret , it &apos;s made .
so , when i &apos;m my hand of you from you , i &apos;m <unk> you from the back of the back , you &apos;re moving from the back , my fingers here , my <unk> , just from where he was so <unk> .
great ?
there is someone who didn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s got here . right .
and if i <unk> myself , the fingers change his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a delusion , why you don &apos;t see that there are only three fingers to see , because the mind and the way he &apos;s going to process information , they &apos;re not going to be able to count , one , three , three , but you see .
but this is not that i &apos;m not going to open up here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s <unk> , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my <unk> , is the right now .
and if i close my hand , the same thing i &apos;m going to get is , is it &apos;s going through the motion of hidden , that &apos;s finger again .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can take your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really has been completely blown me out of my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and therefore this was an amazing thing for me .
it &apos;s got this : if you &apos;re a <unk> in a <unk> shape , in a white pill , is that just a round of you , white pill , white pill , which has given a certain effect .
but if you can change the shape that you give it that $ a smaller pill , for example , into a smaller pill , and these blue colors and a letters that is actually measurable .
and that , although none of these <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? actually actually , that really resonated with me .
it turned out that it &apos;s not all everything .
when you take it , more powerful than you can , more powerful than you can .
a colored capsule that &apos;s on a end yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the spider is also playing a role .
a pill twice a day , not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics of the most detailed statistics . i can &apos;t remember .
but the key thing is , ...
... that &apos;s the <unk> part of the role .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you need to grab a needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> substance -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you &apos;re using a patient .
it creates a very powerful image in the head . that &apos;s much more powerful than a white pill .
this is really -- i &apos;ll show you another time you have a different time when we have a shot .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem to make as much as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem like a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
and none of it has really been a <unk> property . it &apos;s just our belief that we could do a stronger .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something which is obviously a deception , and let &apos;s make it real .
we know that we need to reach the way to the needle , if it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to make you a little bit of a little bit of a little <unk> .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and <unk> it through her , until she &apos;s got back to the other side .
if you &apos;re a bad thing -- if you drop it out , i &apos;ve got a couple of friends last night in the room room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman &apos;s almost <unk> .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be a quick <unk> , you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first part of the back here .
you can see it &apos;s the same thing , but you can also see it , if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , on the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
does i feel real sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and just a little bit of my skin through my skin and over the other side of it .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had the <unk> .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> himself to himself the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back to say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this . &quot;
people in the <unk> are coming in .
let me show you that you &apos;re looking at this .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can do the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re going to be a bad , look way you don &apos;t .
the people back to the back or the ones that you see that later , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; well , this looks quite impressive , but if it was real , he would bleed , you &apos;re a hole and there , if it really would be real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me just make a little blood for them .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
i usually would take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and they show them that there are no <unk> .
but i think that &apos;s in this framework and with the purpose of a kind of <unk> , i &apos;m going to just put the needle in there and so let &apos;s go from the stage .
we &apos;ll be a couple of time to meet some of us in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll be excited . thank you .
everyone &apos;s talking about happiness .
i &apos;ve been given some people the number of books that are released to &quot; happiness , &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they took about 40 to , and there was much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all these tide , there are several cognitive ones that are not nearly impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by these cognitive <unk> act .
this is true for the <unk> who thinks about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just so <unk> .
the first one of these is the <unk> , complexity is to admit to the complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not useful word anymore , because we &apos;re using it to a lot of different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could be able to do it , but in big , and all we need to be , and we will become the complicated view of thinking about what &apos;s well-being .
the second thing is an understanding of experience and memory is basically being between happy his lives and happy about his life , and happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects the well-being , without changing its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> student after a student who was in a story . &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; , he said he had a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the recording there , it was absolutely beautiful music .
and then he actually put it in , really quite emotional , that has all been ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t have it .
what it was ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience of it .
he had 20 minutes of music .
she didn &apos;t care because he was a memory <unk> ; it was ruined , and he was ruined the memory was anything that he had to keep on .
what we really is saying is that we could think about other people , in the sense of two ways of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present lives and the present knows that the past will experience again , but it &apos;s basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> itself , the doctor &apos;s <unk> -- you know , if the doctor asks you , &quot; i &apos;m going to hurt you if i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> and the story of life is , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s the physician that he &apos;s going to be , &quot; how did you feel at the time he felt like this ? &quot;
or &quot; how did you get your journey to albania ? &quot;
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two is to be part of the <unk> of the happiness of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts with a basic reaction on our memories -- it &apos;s beginning to be .
we don &apos;t tell stories when we make ourselves , stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we think of being is a story .
and let &apos;s <unk> with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that are <unk> into this painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into details . it &apos;s not more painful , but she was painful , but she was painful , and she was painful when they were done in the 1990s .
they were asked to tell 60 seconds to report all the pain .
and here are two patients . they &apos;re their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has suffered from them ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
so the patient b has been <unk> , his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how did these patients do that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient is a much worse <unk> of the <unk> as a patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends up .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse is the pain at its end , it &apos;s a terrible story .
where do we know ?
because we &apos;ve asked these people after their <unk> , and then , a lot later , &quot; how bad was all the whole thing in all the way ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct conflict between the self and the <unk> itself .
so from the point of view , a <unk> has been a worse time .
well , what you could do with the patient is , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , and it works , you could actually do the <unk> of the patient &apos;s patient just simply simply <unk> the tube tube .
this is what &apos;s going to lead the patient &apos;s patient , but just a little bit and much less than before .
and if you make a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve got to make that the <unk> self , the <unk> self is a bad deal and you &apos;ve got it that the <unk> itself is a better story about his experience .
what &apos;s going on ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory is , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
so what &apos;s the story of <unk> is making considerable moments and end .
and the end of the end is very , very important , and in this case , <unk> .
well , life lives itself .
it &apos;s got moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean most of our life -- and i got this thing -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds , meaning , you know , that there are about 600 million of you , and in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignored from the <unk> self .
and yet , you know , they should count the impression that what happened in the moments of life is happening .
it &apos;s limited resource that we use as we &apos;re in the world .
and as we use it to the use of it , but it &apos;s not the story that the self will hold the self for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the time for you .
from the view of the <unk> self , if you have a holiday and the second week , just as good as the first , then the <unk> vacation vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
so this is how not work on the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> , <unk> itself is barely better than the <unk> vacation because there &apos;s no new memories going to be added .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , the critical variable that is a critical variable that is a <unk> itself from a <unk> self .
well , the <unk> self is going to make more than to remember and stories stories .
it &apos;s actually the decisions that is making decisions because if you have a patient , who are saying two <unk> in two different surgeons and deciding what he had to choose , then the vote that &apos;s memory is that less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a few experiences .
we think about our future as a <unk> .
and basically you can look at that , you know , as a <unk> of the self , and you can think of yourself as a tyranny of self as one thing that &apos;s kind of <unk> <unk> through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re paying a lot of a lot of the case , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing on vacation , in the service of the <unk> self .
and that &apos;s a little bit of justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do with our memories ?
this is a reason that &apos;s dominance for the dominance of the self .
and when i think about that , i think we &apos;ve done a few years that we &apos;ve done on the antarctica of a few years ago , the most clearly the best day i had ever had , and i think , often , relative often in relation to other people .
and i probably probably have my memories on this trip that i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i had the <unk> , the 600 pictures would have opened another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and this is an <unk> and a half a year .
there seems to be a glut .
well , i love a little bit of extremely , you know , how little appetite i feel on the <unk> of memories , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories of memories of the weight that we give memories of ?
so i want you to think about a thought thought .
now , imagine your next holiday you , you know , that &apos;s the end of the <unk> all their images , and you get a <unk> drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same day ?
and if you choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between their two types of self and you need to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think you &apos;re going to be an answer , and if you think in the sense of time you could think another answer .
so why we choose the <unk> , which is a problem that we &apos;re carrying with a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of self are two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of a self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in life of the <unk> self ?
and they &apos;re all -- lucky for a few moments , a pretty much more process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now going to be a pretty good idea of happiness by happiness itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky enough to the happiness of the <unk> self is a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy is a person .
it &apos;s about how happy is the person who is to think about , if this person is about their lives .
very different term .
every one that &apos;s not different in these terms of happiness is going to screw the study of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being , which is a kind of thing that makes exploration of happiness .
the distinction between happiness of the <unk> self and the <unk> of the <unk> itself is , in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to make the two <unk> .
the gallup organization has a global poll where more than one of a million people asked more than one million people asked more about their lives and over their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we started thinking about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main thing that we think is that they &apos;ve been learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy somebody with his life is , and you don &apos;t care about how he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you meet somebody else , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you &apos;d think about the size of knowledge , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life is about a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is , how happy he is about his <unk> himself .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness is defined .
we know that money is very important , and targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly being satisfied with people who are like we &apos;re doing time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s a dominant .
so if you &apos;re lucky enough to maximize two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;m told here is that we really don &apos;t really want to think of that happiness than a replacement replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , quite short , another reason we &apos;re not thinking about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same stuff when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california won &apos;t get the answer to california .
if you think that the question is , people think that people have to be happier when they &apos;re saying , let &apos;s say in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what makes it , say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the <unk> itself , and it &apos;s not even very important to the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> is responsible for itself , you can -- some people could draw at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to what happens to be in california , which is to california , to be happier , in hope , happier .
now , your <unk> self will not be happy .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happy , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible the weather in ohio and you &apos;ll feel that they were made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;m hoping you &apos;ll give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we heard a couple of weeks ago , you &apos;ve talked to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that was a place that came out of this place .
is that something that you can do with us , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number we &apos;ve found absolutely not expected to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
when we looked at how feelings affects income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re becoming more happy , the poorer they will .
we get a very absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely have seen flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t take money , but that scarcity is a <unk> , and we can measure this very , very clearly measure .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve the happier .
it &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , in the whole american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , freedom to happiness .
if people take this seriously , i mean , it &apos;s all the head of places that seem to put everything in the head , everything that we think , for example , and so on .
is there a chance that politicians generally would generally have a <unk> like this country , and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think there is recognition for the role of the politics in politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , not question , but in the u.k. , she &apos;s going to happen and in other countries .
people are saying that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore the <unk> , or whether they want to explore , we need to have this conversation quite soon .
how to get happiness is very different depending on how you think and if you think about the <unk> , or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
that &apos;s what i think will affect politics , i think in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
this is going to be part of , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this topic is going to be , or should the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to save it &apos;s just easy to save the world in the reality of the reality that you &apos;re in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince you to more people , including them all over time playing more time playing more and <unk> .
currently we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but actually , my research at the institute of the future , the future is the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we wanted to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time .
i calculated that the time needed 21 billion hours of a week .
so , maybe that seems like something , maybe something , so i &apos;m going to work it , if we &apos;re treating problems like hunger , poverty , climate change and obesity , obesity and obesity , and obesity , i think we need to play games online for at least 21 .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty much why i think games games are so critical for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil <unk> .
he wanted to draw the emotions in the game , so he did a camera that was built on the players .
this is one of the classic expression .
if you don &apos;t know any player , you may be , you know , you may be some of the nuances in this picture .
you see , you probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also , concentration , it &apos;s really hard to solve , and really in solving a real difficult problem .
if you &apos;re going to play , you see some of some of the <unk> that are <unk> up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows that are surprising .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a call , <unk> .
oh , you know , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
an <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re in fact to be something . this is a <unk> victory victory .
this player is a short victory in a victory victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of <unk> around the world , if we have to see the barriers of the next century in the attack , the face of which all the <unk> lies on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it as &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad at &quot; <unk> . &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i &apos;m like that , i &apos;m like that &quot; in life , &quot; <unk> .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. &apos; ph.d. in &apos; ph.d. &apos; research is better than in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that &apos;s a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not as good in the reality of the reality .
and i don &apos;t just succeed . even though it &apos;s heard .
we &apos;re going to get more in <unk> more . i mean , well , my good related to the motivation , to do something <unk> .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think that many of us are going to turn into our best version , every time , and immediately helpful to try and try to solve the problem as long as it takes to the <unk> .
and in reality , if we go on obstacles , we don &apos;t feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , or depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
those feelings we never do when we play games , in games , they don &apos;t just exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a ph.d. .
why is it impossible in games to think , you could not just get anything ?
how can we translate these feelings from the way that we &apos;re in the reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideal environment for the collaborative environment is for the problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that would make you <unk> , in the <unk> , so that &apos;s possible .
so , first , if you &apos;re in one of these <unk> , particularly in the world of warcraft , in front of the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to <unk> them , and immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect at your current level , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t fix them .
but always the edge of your capabilities , so they have to work , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and <unk> . there &apos;s always absolutely absolutely important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where you go to , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to do their epic mission .
so we don &apos;t have that in real life , that sense that there are in a lot of <unk> minority of a lot of staff .
and also , this epic story is history , and this inspiring story , why we are , and what we do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have determined , &quot; level , &quot; and &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + &quot; + 1 . &quot;
this is feedback that &apos;s not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i didn &apos;t like to say , &quot; and one is a <unk> idea and + + 20 crazy idea .
i get a lot in the real life .
so , the problem of the <unk> is like the world of warcraft , that it &apos;s so satisfying to be the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we rather rather spend our entire time in those <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so , until today , all the world of <unk> has been working together for millions of years to solve the virtual problems of solving the <unk> problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it sounds like bad .
but in order to see it , a <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> line was going to go to meet our first <unk> .
so the first is so primate .
ok , so when we talk about it , how much time we &apos;re talking about , is that just a sense of when you &apos;re on the scale of the human development in terms of the scale of the human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out that we use this whole time by using these whole time on the game , actually , that changes what we are as people are capable of .
we &apos;re developing a collaborative thinking , so much creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
so , looking at this interesting statistics that recently published a recently carnegie university : the average boy man of man in a country with a <unk> <unk> 10,000 hours of <unk> <unk> to the 21 .
so 10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons .
first once , for children in the united states , <unk> hours of the u.s. <unk> , they spend in school , from the grade grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a full of <unk> here , where young people are just as learning what it means to be a good player , like anything else , which you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell &apos;s book , &quot; <unk> , &quot; read . &quot;
so it &apos;s all the theory of the success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> that if we spend 10,000 hours of the <unk> , of a living subject to the 21 , we &apos;re going to become a master &apos;s 21 .
we &apos;re going to do so well , whatever the most important people in the world are .
so what we have here is a whole bunch of generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players are good ? &quot;
because if we could find that we &apos;d never have a potential before there &apos;s a potential of human potential .
so many people have in the world at least an hour per day a day in the world with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people , which are quite good in &quot; something .
and the next decade we have another billion players , who are extraordinarily well in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> designed to save energy and working on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so that number of <unk> , with the world , in india , china can play online .
you expect another billion players in the next decade .
so we have a total 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , what we &apos;re doing these games are doing .
and here are the four things that i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do it immediately , a vibrant barrier , and with the belief that we have an actual successful hope for success .
and the players always believe that an <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth it &apos;s worth of trying to do it , and it &apos;s equal .
players don &apos;t sit around .
gamers are masters in the spiders are <unk> social networks .
there &apos;s a lot more interesting research that shows people more like we &apos;ve played people after we played with them , even if they defeated us .
the reason that it is that there is a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time with us spend that the rules are going to be <unk> that we have the same goal and to the <unk> .
so the <unk> of the <unk> is growing by <unk> , trust and each other .
and as a result of that , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week is playing , sort of <unk> .
the reason is that when we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that we as human beings are working , optimal , if we do hard work , do we get hard work .
and the players are willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , this is what &apos;s important .
the player &apos;s love to be part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world &apos;s going to be the same .
here &apos;s a <unk> to get that into the right light light on the back of the world , you all know , the largest bang in the world .
the second largest environmental organization , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet , as a matter of any other <unk> in every world in every world .
they created a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that are going to lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . it &apos;s like , why people people spend so much energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be <unk> , as a <unk> , virtual worlds and <unk> .
and the economist is , he &apos;s logical . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says that that makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life in more than real life .
you can play in more powerful social bonds than in real life , and you get more feedback and reward rewards in play in real life .
so he says , it &apos;s now in the fact that players are more of the virtual world in virtual world than in the real time .
i agree for it to that .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game game .
my inspiration is about an event that 2,500 years of <unk> .
there &apos;s these ancient cubes , from <unk> . you know ?
before these fantastic <unk> gave it <unk> .
and that was kind of kind of <unk> , so the first of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the <unk> of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> , you may know that this story is one . the story about how and why games invented .
according to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> while famine .
so , there was such great famine that the king of <unk> was a crazy idea of <unk> himself .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extremes .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> national strategy . it would eat . the next day would you play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , and there are so fascinating and we &apos;re so fascinating and with <unk> , <unk> productivity , they would forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , she survived for this 18 years , and they were eating a day and the next one .
so , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
we &apos;re going to play a game to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing games for everything that is not working in the real world , particularly that life works , particularly that in real life , and we get ourselves what we need to play out .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is the exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years , famine years ago , the famine decided , and then the king decided , the king of one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a <unk> and the best to make a <unk> adventure .
they were <unk> and they were looking for a new home , and they &apos;d just had so many people back to how it was food to the survival and looked for the rest of a place where they could thrive .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show shows that the <unk> that were introduced to the roman empire , the same dna that &apos;s the old <unk> .
so scientists , scientists have recently to have the notion that the <unk> story was in fact .
and geologists found evidence of a global <unk> that almost 20 years , which could explain .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe you have your people in play in games by <unk> , by <unk> , and then these <unk> had been <unk> and then they had this <unk> and so much about the other people , that they &apos;ve saved that they have the entire civilization of civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing <unk> since 1994 .
this was the first time in real time in real time of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of <unk> , we &apos;re going to play for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to play our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half their civilization to the quest for a new world , and so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion of a week .
we should be <unk> that half of us an hour every day playing an hour , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the problems of real world in games ? &quot; and i &apos;ve done this question i &apos;ve been at the last few years at the institute of the future .
we have this banner in the office in palo alto , it &apos;s how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to think the best best outcome , and then people , and then people , that idea that idea into reality .
we want to be able to do this , and give people the possibilities to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you a short bit of three games that i designed to do , to try to get people &apos;s <unk> , people will be willing to get their own future .
this is the world without oil . &quot;
the game is about 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you need to get a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , it &apos;s going to be realistic , and you &apos;re actually going to live with the game , tell us how to sign your life , tell us how much oil costs , tell us where food costs are closed , whether you live , tell us about how food costs closed . and then you ask them to it about it , video or photos .
we &apos;ve been in this game with some of the <unk> players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been in them last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an adventure and i said , &quot; look oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go .
find out how they survive , most of our players have to have the <unk> habits of the game , <unk> habits .
so we have a higher <unk> game , a higher objective goal of just a higher goal of the only way .
we have the game called <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; at the institute of the future .
the beginning is a <unk> calculation that people only have been left with only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , of course .
the call on gamers , sign , we have almost like a <unk> <unk> design .
you know , jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and only they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our challenge , the future for energy , food , security and security , the future of social justice .
8,000 gamers played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when you google &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we got to take on the third march . it &apos;s a game with collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , it &apos;s going to be the <unk> <unk> of social <unk> , in 2010 , in 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and invite them to social learning .
we have a comic . we have a level of high understanding of understanding , <unk> , sustainability , sustainability and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to the game that i share with young people all around the world , particularly in <unk> , who are going to benefit together to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think ? what &apos;s going on ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that we can show us what we can , but we don &apos;t have the real world yet saved .
well , i hope that you agree with me that the human resources are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games will have a big meaning for change .
we have these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to get tight social networks , and <unk> and the desire to make sense of what &apos;s meaning .
i &apos;m really hoping that we &apos;re going together with great games to survive on this planet , to survive another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design with me like this , and play .
so if i &apos;m in the next decade , i &apos;m sure two things that we can create each future , and we can create each other , and we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> play .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that i wrote on a few months ago at writing &apos;s wired for a few months ago .
i always write my <unk> right now , but i was working on the <unk> of the text , and i fell on that i never had in my life , i noticed that i never mean in my life , what the word &quot; is &quot; disabled . &quot;
i read them to you .
&quot; disabled &quot; : &quot; <unk> , helpless , useless , destroyed , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and weak .
<unk> : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i have this list of a friend , read aloud , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i could just read this list , and i couldn &apos;t stop and reading the <unk> and the following emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought that the issue was pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s , when i started to school , and so i started to build my sense of self outside of my family , and to form my sense of self , and the rest of the world around me .
and god is not a <unk> at the time .
i would take this point seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me could perceive me as a person that whose life would be positive in a way , but i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve been experienced .
so i immediately got the <unk> of 2009 to give them to the <unk> of 2009 , i think i find a <unk> .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she &apos;s not much better .
especially , i &apos;m going to shake the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe to this .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many of the <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , they really believed that the <unk> one has a big force because that &apos;s what you can call <unk> , can also be <unk> .
so what do we want to do is -- one disabled people , or a healthy people ?
just to call a human <unk> as a child , it could be , you know , <unk> and you &apos;re <unk> and you &apos;re <unk> .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them ?
a man who opened for me opened my pediatrician , was my pediatrician at the <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name you can think of that most americans couldn &apos;t have been correctly , so he was called dr. p. p. .
and dr. p. <unk> was very colorful , and it was working for work with kids like created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to start with a little bit of practicing an infinite , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i loved these emails as everything else . i &apos;ve been <unk> . i &apos;ve got them . i &apos;m <unk> . i &apos;ve hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them
and imagine i &apos;ve even seen as a <unk> child with dr. p. <unk> and so , trying to stop these practice , <unk> without success .
and one day , he showed me in one of my hands -- these were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll get one day of one day .
and if you can make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. p. so i &apos;m making the practice i &apos;m not going to make , with the chance of the world , the world &apos;s richest five year-old girl in the hospital hospital , but he actually made me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes .
and i wonder today , how much his vision was as powerful and powerful young girls in my sense , and i could imagine that as one of nature from a strong , powerful and <unk> individuals .
this is just one example of many , like adults in <unk> who can make a child .
but as the fact that most of the <unk> examples , we don &apos;t have our language , imagine something that we would all wish to do : it &apos;s every single possible to enable himself to see himself as powerful people .
our language of <unk> will be the social changes that in many cases , in many cases , in a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , you can see that my legs , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of titanium and artificial <unk> for aging bodies that allow people to do natural destiny and complaining about social <unk> , which they allow them to go out of natural systems that they &apos;re driving from natural <unk> systems .
so , maybe it brings that technological change , because the one always brings the other truth , namely , that every person of society can be something very <unk> and very powerful , and that the human ability to be able to adapt something very powerful and very powerful .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how i <unk> with <unk> , and i &apos;m going to really apologize to you , and i think very uncomfortable with the questions of people who i was very uncomfortable with this , and i think i &apos;m very uncomfortable with the questions of people .
this sentence from the <unk> lives of the idea that success or happiness depended on , a challenge to master , without being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to succeed with my life .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing , of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not an obstacle that we need to <unk> to us to make with our lives better .
<unk> are just just to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes i can &apos;t see that he &apos;s barely seeing it , but it &apos;s constantly at me .
and i &apos;m not going to have the impact or the heavy of the human <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are <unk> and challenges of the life of the life , and it &apos;s just a <unk> and every person &apos;s about it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come with a <unk> , or not , but how we get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people who we love to preserve from <unk> , but they also prepare to get good at that .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things out : the one who &apos;s medical , is to be an <unk> , and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m not disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability that i had to put on to the is that the world is always saying that it could be the time , and it could describe me with this definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart , and they &apos;re the cold , hard truth about your medical likelihood or even a prediction of the quality of life that you would expect to make us look at that person &apos;s disabled .
maybe the current concept is that just what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we repair it , for each one individual disability is a greater disability than the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t treat a human , and not all of its forces and possibilities and recognize and recognize , we can do it in addition to the natural fight for you , another disease .
we <unk> a human being made for our society .
so we need to look beyond the <unk> of the human possibilities and focusing on all the human possibilities .
most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , and there &apos;s a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be these <unk> times , or we should not try to do it , nor we should not try to avoid them , nor should we avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see the <unk> .
it &apos;s perhaps more to me , to ask , that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of the <unk> , but we &apos;re open to the <unk> , you can put a hug to the <unk> , and maybe you might even dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> as a kind of natural , <unk> and useful to see ourselves as a presence of their presence through their presence .
in this year we celebrate the 200 one . my birthday was darwin &apos;s darwin and when he wrote about a hundred years ago , has written , darwin , in my eyes , on a very real real character in human character .
i would like to use it : not the powerful of its kind of life , and also not the <unk> of his kind , but the one that can adapt to the best .
in conflict , creativity is creativity .
not only from the darwinian work , we know that the ability of the people , and survive , from the struggle of human mind is destined to change in conflict .
so , again , change and customization are the greatest skill of people .
and maybe we know what wood is we &apos;re in the <unk> , if we &apos;re really involved .
it &apos;s potentially the sense of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can even give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning to give the most things that are going on .
maybe we can see more <unk> than change .
<unk> are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to us .
i think the biggest thing that we have is to think of ourselves , is to believe that we should be normal .
so let &apos;s face it -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical one , but not the normal , and you &apos;d get these arms , gray person , you know , if you really have to do it ?
i think rather .
it &apos;s great if we &apos;re seeing this paradigm against another kind of possibilities or the strength to make it even more dangerous to a matter of a little bit more dangerous to the power of very many of the forces , and they can release their very specific and valuable skills to society .
<unk> is found out that we humans have to have people from the members of our society , and they have always given them useful and to do a contributions .
there &apos;s evidence that we have , the neanderthals are about 60,000 people over 60,000 people with severe physical injuries with severe physical physical injuries , and that might happen because the <unk> is in the <unk> of these people who are valuable for society .
they don &apos;t have these people as <unk> and they &apos;re looking at them ; they were treated as something special and precious .
a few years ago , i went to the city in the city , where i grew up in a <unk> in the <unk> in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was a <unk> tomato sauce .
it was summer , and i had a <unk> .
and i hear the guy behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m looking at this older man , and i had no idea who &apos;s he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remind you that you &apos;re not going to remember me .
when i first saw her first time , i was out of her belly her mother . &quot;
oh , so this .
and of course , it &apos;s got a click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i knew only about narratives of my mom &apos;s tales , because i of course , quite typical , my birthday was late , my birthday came to late two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> my mom was on holiday , and my parents knew the man who had brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet turned after you , and i just had some toes on this and a few toes of this and a few toes had to be <unk> , that was <unk> to the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell you your parents , you would never walk as a independent , and never as mobile as other kids or you could never have a independent life . &quot;
i really found that he was collected in my whole day , i &apos;d collected my entire childhood , no matter whether i &apos;d won the scholarship or one of my <unk> <unk> , whether i won my scholarship or one of my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he used to these little clips to teach him to his students , <unk> from the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> &apos;s potential , the potential of human being willing .
you can &apos;t stop enough to the point of how the critical factor for the quality of life is to be a human .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if you don &apos;t get something else , if you don &apos;t get a little bit of a support , if you can only get a little bit of a support when you can kids yourself , you can do children . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his mindset .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody are doing it , two different things .
and i also think i think of the time when it &apos;s changed at me at age 15 years , if i asked my <unk> against legs , whether i had my <unk> against legs and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i want to really normal at that point .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experiences .
and maybe that change was happening because i &apos;ve been a lot of people to have opened doors , and instead of people who have opened me , instead of people who wanted me to do a picture of the <unk> .
see , you just see it really , just a person who can demonstrate how they can <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you can give it to someone to activate its own , internal forces -- the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , a door open , and then they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that is in one is , the potential of <unk> .
again , what potential to do is we want to get ?
in the 1960s , in britain , in britain , in britain , <unk> <unk> into <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the u.s. &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the u.s. &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are going to get into the notes .
and the student , <unk> <unk> , and then , the better teachers and the <unk> .
they &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and they were told to you , they were <unk> , they were very smart . and after three months , she wrote a <unk> .
and of course , it &apos;s going to be a heart to hear that vice versa , the vice versa , they &apos;re just enough .
and it &apos;s just the three months .
but just those who still were at school , besides -- besides the students who had to school school .
so the key thing about this trial was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they were the <unk> and they &apos;re the students that are good at students with the note and they &apos;ve treated them and they &apos;re treating them .
the only real disability is an <unk> mind of a mind that has broken , has no hope . it &apos;s not there , it &apos;s not because it finds nothing more <unk> . it &apos;s not there .
if we create it , the human spirit involved in the human mind , and still hope to be beautiful and other people around it to find beautiful and <unk> , we put our forces really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can actually create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called <unk> in the <unk> century , and i was written by my friend , &quot; &quot; every child knows god , &quot; &quot; every child knows , &quot; &quot; every child knows god , &quot; &quot; every child knows god , but the god &apos;s , and the god knows &quot; the god . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are currently right ?
so suppose i said that , in a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- more accurately , more and faster and faster .
or want to be more <unk> , more powerful , more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer to live health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always going to be more after more creativity .
and what would you like most of you ?
what would you like to have to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about the kinds of creative people there are .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide to decide to make a good mind ?
already a few more .
what about fitness ?
a few less .
what &apos;s in longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to be as a physician .
if you could just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all the time ?
or is it maybe possible ?
evolution is a <unk> theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you a doctor of a doctor &apos;s theme .
the big geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a essay called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t think of biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not the evidence of biology , that would be a very good time , your <unk> , take your personal <unk> -- i give you permission -- and you might give you the lens -- and you might see nothing in the other way that talk is going to make any sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think this is just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other <unk> or it &apos;s too much of us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this image , i have a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because when you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> of these branches have been success : they have survived ; it &apos;s got to be fitness and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far , far , is that we &apos;re most interested in most of the most interested .
we &apos;re mapping from a shared ancestor , about six or eight million years .
in this period , there were maybe 20 or 25 different types of hominids of hominids .
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re pretty remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , the biggest mechanisms are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is you clear that we can pull out and the mechanics of a common bacteria can make the protein of the human <unk> to produce the protein of the human <unk> that is used to treat the <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> of what &apos;s wrong .
and we &apos;ve heard about bacteria , you know , that every one of us in our gut are more likely to bacteria in our gut , when you &apos;re in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think of the antonio damasio after you ask your question to your point , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you will all of the nutrients that you could just want to do with you without a effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way for bacteria , with <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re not going to help the pit of the <unk> nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a sort of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we think something else is going to be different -- something that &apos;s actually adapted to the environment .
let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first of the creatures that are living in the last year three or a billion years -- and then the human species that &apos;s going on in the last year of the last year .
in this great <unk> symphony symphony in the universe , is life on earth just short ; the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that was us .
this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope that , ace of the ace of them .
well , when i was a <unk> college at college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i &apos;ve been doing something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in the <unk> organisms , <unk> , each cell , and all the genetic information is going on in both <unk> and continuing to run together .
but at the time , as a <unk> organisms , the things started to change things .
sexual reproduction is coming in the image .
and very important : the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome of sexual reproduction , is the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of our body in evolution in the same time is to happen in the same time as the sexual reproduction reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but every year , is there to my increase .
i &apos;ve got to get the feelings of george burns , who in las vegas , the show of the show in las vegas in the 1990s .
and one night , there is a pat on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
front of it is a beautiful <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to know as a physician &apos;s physician that i was in a goal of <unk> that was different than the goal -- not necessarily the criteria .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to reconnect with the health of a disease .
i wanted to make a long and healthy life .
evolution is all over the average of the genome to the next generation , and <unk> and generation generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , it &apos;s a <unk> standpoint , and i like <unk> rockets to make the genetic <unk> into the next stage of the orbit to send it into the sea .
i think we would all all the mood that the woody people actually understand the woody understanding when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the largest life to prefer the largest lives .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily <unk> the biggest , the most powerful , the world , and not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that are best at its best .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> and therefore , that hot , <unk> , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum , they would have managed to have a <unk> environment for themselves to make it up there .
so what does that mean when we think back to what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of the place in evolution , and particularly as we <unk> into the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to be moving .
we have a kind of balance .
and the reason that we would be , is that we &apos;ve done that , first of medicine , is a lot of genes that otherwise otherwise had been <unk> and made of the population .
and secondly , we as a species we have our environment so that we &apos;ve done it , that they adapt to us , and we adapt them to them .
and by the way , we &apos;re walking around and we make ourselves so much that they can &apos;t say , that isolation is necessary for evolution to <unk> .
another one is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional type of being , of course , is , of course , is the nature of the traditional way of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution is slowly slow , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far , the isolation is when we &apos;re a species , we &apos;re going to colonize the <unk> , and the changes of the environment that can produce evolution in ways in ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility of opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not easy , but we decided to take away from us as a <unk> in the decision we do .
now how did this happen ?
how could it be possible to do this , we could do this ?
let &apos;s think of the reality that people are making , in some cultures decisions about their offspring .
they are in some cultures who are choices to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what &apos;s the thing that &apos;s the one and the family .
so think if it &apos;s not just possible to do your child &apos;s gender , but also to the body genetic self-interest , the disease cure and prevent genetic adaptations , and prevent disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes for diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or more to eliminate the cancer of the cancer or stem cell ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do these changes in their genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
so the following year when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion pairs of the human genome for about 20,000 and in the space of about a week of about a week .
it won &apos;t take more long , until the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollars human genomes , and it will become increasingly available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering , of engineering for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , the independently developed from creating techniques that generated the natural process of evolution to lead faster and to <unk> proteins . &quot;
a few years ago , the <unk> scientist was awarded <unk> for his research in which he took a adult <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell induced to a <unk> , the cell induced to the <unk> cell .
these are changes in the face .
the same technology that &apos;s produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just protection before themselves , but also the immunity to other viruses can serve .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with a <unk> vaccine that has been grown in the cells of a <unk> .
can you think something good that &apos;s eaten from tobacco tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your respective ?
what if you can reduce the sperm and <unk> the <unk> or the <unk> of the newly <unk> egg to give your kids a better chance to make a living life -- eliminating the risk , clean energy , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technologies that can enable the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , that could enable us to prevent the <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially if you can get it to the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> ever <unk> that will allow you to get faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a place that we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the <unk> we can adopt , we will be transformed from <unk> evolution to the <unk> evolution .
we &apos;ll have a process that we might have to do 100,000 years that we can compress it on a thousand years , and maybe in a thousand years , and maybe the next 100 years .
these are decisions with these are decisions with these are decisions , or their grandchildren , are going to be .
do we use these decisions a society that &apos;s better , the more successful is that more friendly ?
or will we be selectively , we &apos;ll choose to choose different attributes that we want to do for some of us , and not for others ?
will we be a society of <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and more <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we &apos;re going to face .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of the challenge we &apos;re going to need to be is to make these decisions ?
in the good , like , in evil , and used to be as you might think , these decisions are going to us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine you now , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another , the <unk> helps help and go up and go to the <unk> of it .
we call this robot <unk> that robot <unk> .
they &apos;re not different than something that you put in the morning and it &apos;s extra strength to give them extra strength and keep your speed and help you , for example , your balance .
that &apos;s where the real is actually <unk> by human and machine .
but not just that -- and connect with the universe and other devices out there with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we work , we start to talk about the american soldiers who &apos;s about 100 pounds on his spine , and it &apos;s got the request that they should have more equipment .
of course , this is a few major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of them -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would take that challenge and create a <unk> that would help you , with this problem .
so let me introduce you to <unk> -- or the human being universal <unk> .
soldier : i can wear 200 pounds of <unk> terrain for a long terrain for many hours .
his intelligent design allows to make it deep deep , to produce , and highly <unk> .
it feels what i want to go to where i want and increase in my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re in the way to imagine our <unk> device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s now take our gaze on the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there &apos;s 68 million people who are in the world &apos;s been in the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s in fact , a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal young people with spinal cord spinal life in the body of the historical body -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 40s , &apos; 40s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number are .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a <unk> , or to the other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years since his , as i say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to create a completely new chapter of creating a whole new chapter .
so let me introduce you to <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , who &apos;s carried to amanda , 19 years ago , the result she couldn &apos;t run any more , for 19 years and to now .
thank you .
like i said , amanda is <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors on the crutches , the signals that <unk> on our spine , which is here on her back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is on its hips as well as it is to your <unk> , as it <unk> , they &apos;re moving forward in this very <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> while a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost each feeling and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again , can never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s got rid of each other &apos;s <unk> of my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been able to learn to go again to ski again , to go again to go to the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and to discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential to change life in future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all the <unk> , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i was ceo of a non-profit organization of a non-profit organization called the <unk> <unk> .
if i was not poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> with a volunteer <unk> fire with a volunteer fire .
now , in our city , they were a <unk> <unk> survivor , you have to be pretty early to be pretty early to the <unk> of the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer of the <unk> , so i was quite good opportunities in the <unk> .
but it was still a race to the other volunteers to reach the <unk> and to figure out what our jobs would be .
when i was the <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which was certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was the middle of the night and she stood in the <unk> and a <unk> outside of a screen in the <unk> rain while her house was in flames .
the other volunteers who were coming to me was -- let &apos;s call him a <unk> luther luther luther luther <unk> first and asked to the house first and the dog &apos;s going to save the dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> .
there was a little lawyer or <unk> who now was for the rest of his life , the people who could tell him that he was a <unk> house to save a living in the house , because it was five seconds .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; <unk> , you need to go into the house .
they need to go up to the fire , and you need to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i hope i &apos;d hoped to hope i went -- the stairs pump up the hallway on the hallway that they were doing so quite done in the bedroom , and they were just done in the bedroom to a few shoes .
i know what you think , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i put my prey back to the bottom door , where i <unk> my <unk> and the loved dog .
we put our treasures out of the outside , the <unk> , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention than my own .
a few weeks later , the <unk> <unk> was a letter of the <unk> that was saving for the brave of the brave of her house .
one more than <unk> <unk> : somebody had a few shoes .
so both of my profession , robin hood , as well as a <unk> in my inbox as a volunteer firefighter , i witnessed , of generosity and kindness at the scale of the big scale , but i see the charity of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i see myself in this room , <unk> and people see that either have a <unk> success or on their way , i want to offer you to offer a memory : wait .
wait for that , you don &apos;t wait to make a difference in another life , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give you something , you &apos;ll give it .
you use them in a <unk> , room , in a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , a chance will give us to live life of one person , but every day , you give us the opportunity to change one .
so they put them off ; they save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going to go from one community that &apos;s the secret of the human human history .
a place where women have the <unk> , with sex , &quot; hi , &quot; and the game that &apos;s -- where do a serious matter is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> to the san francisco or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their blood .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the world &apos;s native whales in the world .
bonobos are connected to chimpanzees , our next living with chimpanzees .
that means we have a shared ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother , which is about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos are going to show us the other side of the coin .
so while chimpanzees of great , fear of great , fear of people are going to be led to the <unk> female female .
they really have a kind of thing up because that leads to a very rare society , which is the fatal violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known under primates .
they live in the deep depths of the <unk> , and they &apos;re just hard to do it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of an extraordinary remarkable biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent argument that has been planned for decades and almost as many lives .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction is at the <unk> of the bonobos .
<unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> lead to the <unk> bonobos could fill it -- and even there &apos;s not sure we &apos;re sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can laugh a <unk> laugh that the trees was upset .
who are these related ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> <unk> , including sex , with <unk> partners , and rules so conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that this is the answer to all of all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos are made of more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just <unk> .
for us , and she &apos;s a fundamental problem with attachment of relationships and the care of the tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play dramatically creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about the creation of creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections , diversity .
and if you look at bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight from the wild wilderness .
first of all , a <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> <unk> .
see what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; it &apos;s got it in the eggs . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s like it &apos;s kind of like it , right .
yeah !
so <unk> are distributed , both of bonobos are being distributed than people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> , which is -- like the <unk> , with the new <unk> , with the <unk> -- and also , how it &apos;s going to be doing it &apos;s fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> and it can take lots of shapes that some of some are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover the back again .
and i want to show you that is a <unk> , a young female , and she plays a <unk> with water .
i think just like you &apos;re going to do that sometimes , and we <unk> boundaries of our inner and outside worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity curiosity that we can make things , and interact with the unexpected fragments that we are creating , are the real ingredient in creativity .
this is just a little <unk> of the insights , the bonobos give us in our past and present .
but it also true true of our future , a future that we need to adapt to the greater challenges , by greater creativity and cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key is to these skills .
in other words , our <unk> is our <unk> .
to succeed in a <unk> world , we need to play .
but will we make the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people , equally , don &apos;t have life in teeth and claws and claws .
now , if it &apos;s barely appropriate , maybe it seems to be a <unk> .
and so my <unk> , let &apos;s leave you this gift of evolution and playing together , while we &apos;re doing the creativity of <unk> and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle of 1979 , in the same day , at the same day , at the same day , every <unk> one baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every <unk> one baby .
now i don &apos;t want to use it too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you imagine the whole time you imagine , you &apos;re not listening .
just imagine that &apos;s just a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case that &apos;s a case a <unk> <unk> that is on the x chromosome in the <unk> .
and in the other case , the divergence is a divergence that is on the x chromosome in the <unk> chromosome .
both of them are <unk> , both fire .
we &apos;re still coming back later these people .
most of my activities , i have two words in the most of my activities .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at me with the story of the anatomy .
i studied a <unk> , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that &apos;s the body , animal bodies , animal bodies -- like they thought about <unk> <unk> , with <unk> ; how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve been carrying in my work is the <unk> of the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , as a impatient lawyer -- by people who are patients from doctors who are doctors of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> social norms , social norms .
so i &apos;ve been working with people who are twins , with the twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- so people who were very common .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with <unk> people whose gender &apos;s been <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word of the word .
<unk> comes in many different shapes .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of the kinds of <unk> guys that are not going to be the male or female standard female .
in one case , you might have a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve all got <unk> at the stage .
and therefore , the testicles are at the <unk> at the <unk> .
but because that individual receptors missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone of the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body is more likely to get more than the typical of the body .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as girls .
but it &apos;s usually when they reached puberty , and their breasts grow and they grow up and they &apos;re developing and developing , but not their <unk> , until someone comes to it , is something different .
and they do some tests and find out that they rather than <unk> and <unk> in reality , in fact , you &apos;re wearing a <unk> chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think that person &apos;s actually <unk> , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that you call a <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the <unk> are making <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i -- i think i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably have a typical -- most women like me , i actually talk about <unk> .
we &apos;re making <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the implication is that somebody like me in a brain that was more <unk> to <unk> that more <unk> than a woman who was born with iran , and has a <unk> .
so what &apos;s gender is really complicated ; <unk> is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way , you can be around the whole range of being distributed .
another example : a few years ago i got the phone call a 19 , man , who was born as boy was born , he had a girlfriend , he had a girlfriend , he had a girlfriend with his girlfriend , and he had just found a uterus .
he had an extreme form of <unk> .
he has <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> so strong , that they basically have a male <unk> .
and as a consequence , his <unk> male in his brain was the <unk> male part of the <unk> &apos;s side of the <unk> .
and when he was born , he saw how a boy made out of -- no one .
and when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually he got enough medical problems , actually because he was <unk> <unk> , that the physicians found that he was female .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , which is something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , gender can occur in many different forms .
the reason why children are with this kind of body -- it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often to be adapted to the norm , not because it could be for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why do you often get different kinds of interventions , because they threaten our social categories .
it &apos;s typical our system in the idea that has a certain anatomical form with a certain amount of identity .
so we have the concept that woman is to have a female identity ; a black person is to be said , &quot; an african anatomy , is that you know , an african anatomy .
so we &apos;ve been this terribly <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that &apos;s actually something very different , confused by us , confused with regard to these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how much it is when children are born , two people are born in a body .
where i had most of the most exciting ever had ever experienced was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year whose gender was <unk> in berlin , in the question of the world &apos;s been asked in berlin .
many journalists would call me the question : &quot; what test test you will make that you will tell us whether or <unk> female female or male ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that it &apos;s not going to this test .
we know that gender is so much enough to admit that nature is enough to us , that nature is not going to be between male and female , or between the male and <unk> and female , and the <unk> are we that , as of course .
so we have a situation that we &apos;ve ever given our science at the time , we need to acknowledge that these categories that we were able to have to get into the intellectual column which makes very simple <unk> , <unk> <unk> , as we suppose .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true in race , which is much more complicated than our <unk> .
in our way we &apos;re going to put in all sorts of <unk> areas .
we &apos;re going to push for instance , that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from you from a few different types of people ?
while we continue our science , we &apos;re going forward , we &apos;re increasingly going into a zone of <unk> where we need to recognize that the <unk> categories that we had probably too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different parts of the human life .
one of the areas that we see that the <unk> is in our world today , in the world &apos;s culture , are the fights over the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what &apos;s a body for people to think about a body that is a different rather than the kind of reasoning life .
we have very hard -- maybe not as the public , maybe not as the public as the medicine -- the question when somebody is dead .
our ancestors never used to hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they have someone else &apos;s ever held a feather under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t bury them yet .
if you didn &apos;t moved more , you &apos;ve got it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation today where we can people take a <unk> of organs and you want to put them to them .
and as a result , we got to the fight with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that &apos;s what makes us in a really hard situation where we don &apos;t have to get more of the very simple categories .
now , they could assume that the whole crash of categories would someone like me happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s really nervous .
and to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , does it make me .
and it &apos;s kind of <unk> me in the opinion of the democracy .
so to tell you about that <unk> , i &apos;ve got to <unk> , i &apos;m first fan of the founding of the founding .
i know that they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and very strong and so radical , what they did was that i &apos;ve got a few years to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely too .
it &apos;s because what &apos;s happened with the <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
the founding of my view were the original <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s why .
what they were <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they &apos;re using it through another , and it was beautiful , and 200 years of us were central .
as you all remember , <unk> our founding the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was <unk> in a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the masters of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people have the political power to the political power , which is supposed to have political power because of the grandfather &apos;s <unk> from a grandfather to son and so on .
so the founding of the idea was back and replaced them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all the people were created by the same .
they <unk> the field , and decided that <unk> , which is the common world , not the difference . and that was very radical .
well , they did this part because they were part of a <unk> system where two things are in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , also , the science has been going to be science .
if you look at the story of the fossil record , you &apos;ll see that many of you were very interested in science , and they were in a concept of a world &apos;s most <unk> world .
they were made of explanations , <unk> things , and meadows things like a <unk> concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very <unk> concept of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they were a concept that was common by <unk> .
and so it really did not have the future rights rights rights rights rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened to this ?
for example , women who <unk> the <unk> , the concept of the founding , which is that the anatomical is more important than the anatomical , and said that the anatomical is common more important than the anatomical difference , and we said that we should not have the <unk> <unk> , right ?
and women <unk> the way .
and when the next came the successful movement , where we were people watched like <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> on , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> rows of the <unk> line that says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are different skin color that are in anatomical common differences with a lot of these things , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the commonalities , we need to ask to ask , why we &apos;re certain more <unk> .
well , mind , i want to be certain of a <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish that &apos;s the same right as a human person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take from the anatomy distance .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be the right thing to spend your school teacher or to get married .
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that make sense for me , and we think that i should keep thinking .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re making sense .
so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , both in 1979 , right day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of <unk> , she was born to june 1 , born in 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born to <unk> , so he &apos;s born at the one of the march 1980 .
because only because maria was born , three months <unk> , they would have all sorts of right back three months before <unk> -- the law must have sex , rightly , rightly , to drink .
<unk> has to wait for all this , not because it &apos;s a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other <unk> in terms of what their rights are .
<unk> , because you think that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the male <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can now be in the way that the hell don &apos;t worry .
maria , in all the states , can &apos;t be the same , the <unk> <unk> in all states , and that &apos;s quite a happy .
<unk> can marry a woman in every country , but maria can only marry a woman in a few countries .
so we are these <unk> categories in many ways , are problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , that &apos;s what our science is going on in the field of anatomy , that we can admit that democracy is based on anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like the science itself is making its own .
so where are we going to ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to pull up somewhere in a line , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are <unk> in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas , at a point that , texas , is that , a man means to marry , you know , you have no chromosome , and a woman to marry , you know , you &apos;ve got a <unk> chromosome .
now in practice , people are not going to have a lot of their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve told you about the <unk> <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i dream , &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people to do their skin , but according to the property of their character , &quot; judge , and goes through anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you say people from their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to be able to be in relation to people to people to because i admit i a series of a series of <unk> that probably are more important than some people i know .
i want to <unk> that i probably probably have some bright <unk> , the <unk> are more <unk> , more intelligently , more intelligently , more intelligently to make their sexual relationships as some of the <unk> i know .
so how to we do the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of my question is what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be in the future -- could be made in the future -- could be made ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to be important about the idea that the u.s. is a leader in the united states , thinking about questions of democracy .
in our sector for democracy , we have our very good job , and i think we &apos;d better do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as it was in iran , where a man who is <unk> to other men , with death , unless he &apos;s ready to screw up a <unk> , which is where he &apos;s ready to stay alive .
in this way , this kind of species exist .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these words -- a surgeon with a few <unk> twins had to have a few identical twins with his <unk> to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was doing it , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high <unk> operations -- was his answer that in his country , these kids were going to be very bad treated , and therefore he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , have you taken a political way of thinking about a <unk> of the operation instead of a operation to separate them ? &quot;
the united states are giving incredible opportunities to be people that they are , without they , without they will change in the state of the state .
so i think we need to be a leader .
well , just to finish , i want to realize i was very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy might look like , or looked at the mothers of what they would have .
and i want to say something is radical for a feminist &apos;s feminist , and i think there could be different ways that are the anatomy of various ways of anatomy , <unk> when people are a <unk> .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in research , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the world .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from studies studies have learned that women , in average -- not every but on average -- more complex social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable within the world , very much .
and so , if we think about this , we have an interesting situation .
i was a graduate years ago when i was a graduate student , i asked myself one of my favorite <unk> , who was my interest in feminism -- i was looking as a feminist question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s wrong . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> about gender , so therefore , feminism is not a female .
but the more i ever thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something that could be something that could be in feminism .
it &apos;s supposed to be , it could be something , in average , which is female brains of all male different from male , which is <unk> to social relationships and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding of the founding were extremely important to figure out how to be protected from the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that when we &apos;re more moms in this concept , we &apos;re more just like to preserve the way to each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future when we democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body -- less about the individual body , and more about relationships .
so that when we try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it to every chance of another <unk> , <unk> outfit , and in the last time , we also photograph them to photograph another <unk> and to take care of them .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of a second hand in <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to turn the impact on my <unk> to the environment and the <unk> that &apos;s on my purse .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars serve , usually a good purpose of usually a good purpose ; i see quite unique . and it does buy my personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it be less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers is , i feel like i won &apos;t win as if i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve done for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many <unk> with ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pair of <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly a week , what i did in my suitcase .
i have a number of a few other things that i could wear , if i first wanted to wear palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman , who &apos;s here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found , i found a few things .
and i want to show you my <unk> for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to tell you some of the lessons i think i believe you don &apos;t believe it or not , from those <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call the <unk> tiger .
you don &apos;t need to spend a lot of money to make it great .
you can almost look more about less than 50 dollars .
this whole , including the wheel , including me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece of that all week , i carried the most expensive piece of this whole week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad <unk> if you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;ll get your happy to people .
tuesday : <unk> is totally <unk> .
i have a lot of time my life that i spent so much to be , i myself , and i adapt to the same time .
just be they &apos;re just who they are .
if you look at the right people , you &apos;re not just understanding , you &apos;re going to estimate it , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
wednesday wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i would look like i &apos;m wearing games or i i &apos;m at her seven-year-old .
i smile , and i like , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not going to look good in a little good , they probably probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but i only became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap it for a minute .
if you believe that they &apos;re in the inside and the outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to be able to do anything , what we want .
thank you .
on friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> .
and finally , saturday : a personal , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell a difference to a story , without having a word to say to you without having a word to say .
it was always proven to me and repeatedly , when people were coming to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , this isn &apos;t going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;m going to donate this to the <unk> .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn to do this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to be emotionally , because the first time is to be the corner , because the <unk> is always another crazy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , just waiting for me to be a little love in the heart and it &apos;s looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy , in italy , with this picture in italy , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that the formula for one in the past decade has something very interesting .
a while ago , it was so that if you wanted to win a formula for a race , then they took her budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver &apos;s good enough , they won the race .
now , you need to win a race , actually , if you want to win a race , something like this -- something that car in real time , a few thousand sensors have to go out of the car , that information is going to pass on the system and then make things happen in real time .
this would be you , in <unk> , a <unk> call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made from two parts -- a <unk> portion and a <unk> portion .
what &apos;s interesting is the <unk> of the field of life in our lives .
our cities were working in the last few years , and they &apos;re just working with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be a <unk> .
and as a computer , in the free , they start to react to other ways , they &apos;re being perceived and <unk> .
if we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s land .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- it &apos;s going to be 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond cities , all of this sense and <unk> , all of this sense and drive into objects .
this is an exhibition called paola antonelli at moma , in the year , in the summer , in the summer , we were organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to talk back .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom is out there , a sensor and a sensor <unk> out of a sensor and a <unk> .
and that &apos;s a radically radically deal with interaction that we &apos;re seeing people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo shaped the moses , it means that he took the hammer , and it took him on moses , you can still see a little bit of <unk> -- and said , called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you do ? &quot;
well , the environment is beginning to the very first time , to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and <unk> .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i want to think is in fact one of the first our lab .
it was developed a little four years ago .
and what we did since was actually a new kind of network of network that was used to all over the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk> information from this network that &apos;s collected from the phone , to understand how the phone is working .
the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was a italy that won the <unk> won .
some of you will remember , it was when italy was playing , and then at the end of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , in italy , the end of the won .
now you see what happened on this day , just the other activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
on the morning , before the game .
you see the time .
and then afternoon , people used to make the phone calls and move the phone calls and move .
the game starts to -- silence .
france is making a gateway . italy , a gateway .
<unk> people , making a short call , go to toilet toilet .
second <unk> . end of the normal <unk> .
first of all , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
in italy , yeah . yeah .
well , at that night , all the time went to celebrate .
they saw the big thing .
the next day , all the right , all the right to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister .
and then everybody went down .
you see the image of the place of the place , <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the question at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example , as we can feel today , in a way , in a way , we could not have been able to do it a few years ago .
another quick example of feeling : this is not about people , but to make things we use and consume things that we use .
now we know all about where our stuff is coming to where our stuff come .
this is a map that you show you all the chips , that a mac computer is made of how they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go .
so we actually have a few little markers to do the trash of the trash to the trash while it &apos;s going through the system .
so we &apos;ve started with some volunteers that we &apos;ve been making a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , the things that they have helped -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away .
then we have the little potato chips , the little brands , and the little brands that are glued to the garbage and started it .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve got right now .
in seattle ...
after a week .
with that information that we realized there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing in the fact that we do with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup of cup that we throw away , not just that , you know , that &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day , throw it still out .
and if we show that people , we can move into a behavior behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you even see much more about the appearance and the whole other wonderful things that you can perceive with , i want to talk to the second part of that , and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> that came to us and said that spain and a <unk> tradition , to public areas of public areas as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you create technology , new technology that connect with ?
and one of the ideas that were on a <unk> <unk> , imagine , imagine these tubes , and the valves , <unk> , whatever , and close .
they &apos;re doing this kind of <unk> with <unk> water .
if these <unk> fall , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it will open to it , and it will open to you , you can see how you can see on this picture .
well , we launched the mayor of <unk> .
it &apos;s got very well .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re going to approach it , it will open and you go into it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s a burglar , if you want to reduce it , you can even lower the roof .
or you could have the building and the whole architecture that &apos;s going to be like in this case , you know , this time when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there , and they say , &quot; they &apos;ve got the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t fully destroyed the building , it &apos;s just like the architecture of it .
so here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks you what happens inside the inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the test of the sensors that the water opened the water , you can &apos;t get wet .
well , i should tell you what happened to the night of the night , as all the rest stopped .
but it was actually a more fun fun .
all the kids from the <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer longer a building that would open them to a , but a building that still breaks and holes and holes in the water , you had to get jumping into without wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how the people we use things that are creating things that we design .
but the reality is always unexpected .
and this is the nice thing to create things that are being used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building , <unk> , the <unk> of the building , and the projections are the projections .
and this is what &apos;s going to take us about the project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that <unk> really could start to fly in front of these <unk> .
imagine you could have little <unk> that walking through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with a <unk> light with a <unk> light light -- almost as a cloud can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like you saw earlier , which is completely moving to the other , in the beginning of the other moves , in all of sync .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display like this -- a <unk> formation in two dimensions .
or infrequently , but infrequently , in three dimensions , where changes the light changes , not the position of the <unk> .
they can play with different kinds of play .
imagine that the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes in different <unk> .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from <unk> his <unk> , which you can , and you move them through lots of , looking for you from many , many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , <unk> <unk> to form a <unk> .
if you turn the lights on it , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every person is being treated by people .
it could have a <unk> <unk> to have a impulse that &apos;s coming from people , from the motions of the people or so on .
i want to show you something that &apos;s a little first .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> at the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> <unk> at the metropolitan theater in 3d , we &apos;ve taken his movement as a momentum for the <unk> .
here you see dancing dancing .
on the left , you see the <unk> , the different sensations , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all the <unk> , you can play with color and color movement and <unk> .
we want to think that as a kind of impulse for the <unk> use .
i want to show you the latest project that we work on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working for for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people with a kind of thing and to change the environment -- almost like we call it , <unk> , <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that every single pair of a donation can give you a little donation to give you a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable of the things last years , the last decades is that we have a physical one of the digital world .
it &apos;s got all over the digitized , knowledge , and power it &apos;s going through the internet .
nowadays , we can for the first time -- and the campaign announced that -- we can see the digital world , which is <unk> forces of the networks of the world to change the physical forces of the world .
it can be , in our case , we &apos;re using it to design and a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us to ask the next to the climate change -- think of the climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to change .
so the idea is that we actually actually people work with them , in which they are doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud in <unk> , in the same way , as a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a big physical thing in london , but with <unk> .
they can move in and different kinds of experiences .
they can actually look at it from the bottom that most important moments for <unk> 2012 and more , and it &apos;s as a kind of connection to the community .
so both of the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go to the top , like a new <unk> .
they can go inside .
and a sort of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everyone to do that at the top .
thank you .
as an artist &apos;s very important connection .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express this , that people are separated from nature and all connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago , 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
my awe at the time .
my heart conductor , i was <unk> , while i was trying to grab what i was like before .
the <unk> around me about <unk> about 60 feet of the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year after year .
<unk> is born as a calf of a glacier or by <unk> of <unk> .
every iceberg has his own individual personality .
they interact with clear ways of their surroundings and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and <unk> to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t withstand more and <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think you &apos;re isolated , apart , apart and just as we humans see .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg , i <unk> the <unk> atmosphere , i <unk> its <unk> .
during the iceberg , he &apos;s going to put <unk> drinking water that makes lots of life .
i &apos;m going to go on my footage of this <unk> as i would make my ancestors , in consciousness that they were in these individual moments of this way , and never again .
it &apos;s not a death when it &apos;s melting ; it &apos;s not a end , but a <unk> of your life life along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> i &apos;ve been a very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg that i put a iceberg in <unk> in greenland .
rarely actually rarely be the <unk> iceberg of a <unk> iceberg .
so here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
you &apos;re looking at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat has to move to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> about 120 feet of water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just that , you know , the iceberg is another side of his character .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary , and i &apos;m a couple of amazing projects .
but what happened to me , i went to this guy , and it &apos;s about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back , and he said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the one .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was telling him .
i have a company that design and animations , and animations , and so , is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the world &apos;s world .
so we decided to tony -- <unk> -- and his cause to support .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we will give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to you again .
i just want to just again with him , and i asked , &quot; wait for time , is this -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking &apos;s not -- can &apos;t all the <unk> people use of these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;ve heard about the <unk> and a remarkable insurance can you really do that .
normal people are not going to be accessible . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you do it ? &quot;
did someone have the film &quot; <unk> and <unk> &quot; ?
so they communicate -- so they &apos;re walking along their fingers .
i <unk> : &quot; very <unk> , how can it be ? &quot;
so i came with a need to just take a check and i made a check out i was not the slightest idea i had the most , i had the slightest idea of how i was supposed to <unk> it .
i was going to remember the place and ask his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to be speaking , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art .
because it &apos;s an farce that somebody who has yet to hang all the one in the one . &quot;
so i was talking about a few months later .
i met these people from <unk> , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on every surface and then put a technology on a <unk> surface and then you can only draw the negative area of the negative space .
so they &apos;re pulling around and make them <unk> like this .
they say that all things that are going on top up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the donor organs , then the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the least people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life life in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife and she told her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to create things , to control things , and then we should find a way that he would be awesome . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year , after a year , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have reached some things .
first , we have the insurance companies , and actually we have the doors , and actually , for a <unk> device , which he can communicate -- a <unk> of <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers around the world -- literally from all around the world -- literally from all around the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children , and i went into the garage , and this hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> .
so many of our friends thought we &apos;re beautiful , we &apos;re beautiful , and we all <unk> and all the images on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed to <unk> in my <unk> in venice , my children were involved , and my dog created , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of venice , and some <unk> and some things from the prototype and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they put them on a <unk> , and we now have a device that we &apos;re free to build the code for free , the software can you free for free .
so we created a device that completely freely is free .
no insurance can &apos;t be <unk> .
it &apos;s not a hospital .
every <unk> can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , this was incredible .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back in the <unk> room .
i love this image because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his bedroom of someone else &apos;s room .
there &apos;s all this <unk> <unk> of the great revelation .
and after about a year , two weeks ago , two weeks ago , <unk> and <unk> nights , i recorded <unk> and <unk> nights .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it &apos;s about his life .
we have his bed , so it can see outside it .
we have a <unk> set up against a wall of the <unk> in front of the hospital .
and he drew over the first time , in the family &apos;s family , his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what kind of feeling that was in the parking lot .
<unk> , we had to do it again in the same time , so we felt so much as part of the <unk> .
so the end , he would take an email with this content : &quot; for the first time , &quot; for the first time , i have a little bit of a drawing .
i feel that i got under the water , and i finally got down to the bottom and i got my head up to the bottom and my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that ?
this is something like our <unk> .
that keeps us in the <unk> and always continuing to develop .
and we need to improve a lot of this machine .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> right .
and someone who has a potential of potential potential to make it much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to better , and faster , more powerful .
since that time we have all sorts of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us .
it &apos;s all out of our own pockets .
so the more of the time , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december , has been the <unk> honored , as one of the most 50 inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> is that -- and this is the thing that &apos;s all circle -- that it &apos;s been in this april , <unk> <unk> in downtown city of los angeles an exhibition called &quot; the <unk> &quot; &quot; style of the <unk> . &quot;
and there are probably the most respected representatives of the <unk> &apos;s present -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> will be part of the show of what &apos;s quite a <unk> .
so basically , i &apos;m about : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can make it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- they all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never done anything with a <unk> , but i just collected a little bit and i &apos;ve been around with amazing people in the way that we could put something together .
and that question , every one of them should ask you , every single day , to make you something that you could think that &apos;s going to be done . if not now , and if i do , and if i do that , and if i do that ?
thank you .
so i write for children , and i probably think of america &apos;s most frequently <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell the people that i don &apos;t want to come to like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has chosen to be farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and i &apos;m a few .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve got it somewhere .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of a more complicated circle of what i want to tell you today .
so my circle started at the time in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who was green in the green green and blue was blue , until a schoolteacher saved my life .
she saved my life by making me the toilet in the <unk> .
that was actually <unk> .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had to get <unk> , and it was <unk> to california -- i found a <unk> -- and i was in the &apos; 80s , and then i found it &apos;s important to <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , woman , woman , saying , &quot; i need you to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never learned each other as a adults .
you can come to ohio , and i &apos;m going to come to ohio and please come along with the man , i know you &apos;ve got to have it .
and i should say that i have a <unk> , and i said that you &apos;re going to be a hurry . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we were laughing , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we were getting us to , and we gave us to her family eight , because it needed to be .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted me to know me as a adult , to me , to know , turned into a box of <unk> and put into my hands .
what happens was that the circle was closed , it was a circle of -- and the revelation of the i talked about .
the revelation is , the death part of life is .
she has saved my life , and my partner and i have to do her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything else &apos;s rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is how many times mentioned here today .
it needs to be -- it needs to be love , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s like to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big blast , as you go to 1,000 feet , as you go to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
that &apos;s not a fear of <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat down on the <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;re going to hit a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been <unk> , and we weren &apos;t so far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot &apos;s going to put the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route .
it turns out the <unk> .
imagine a <unk> aircraft .
and then he said three words -- the words of words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i had to talk more about the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was to end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me on this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in the lives , and i thought to all the people i wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to do , and i never made all .
while i thought about it later , i noticed a phrase that is , &quot; i &apos;m eating bad wines .
because if the wine is as far as the person &apos;s wine , then i open it .
i never want to change more than a little bit of life .
and this urgency , that goal is really changing my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we <unk> the george bridge , so pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my mistakes , i <unk> , i <unk> , better , in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i have some ego , my ego .
and i <unk> the time i wasted for <unk> things , with people who are doing something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to my wife , to people .
and after that , i decided that when i was thinking about negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have two years , i &apos;m not going to <unk> me .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the internal clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please throw in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to do this thing in 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
as we know , as we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , is not scary .
almost as we would prepare for our lives for all of us .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want ; i love my life .
and the sadness really <unk> really , in a thought , i just wish to make one thing .
i wished i could see my kids growing up .
and about a month after that , i went to visit a <unk> , <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
... not .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m not a little kid like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made a sense for me .
i realized that at the time , i realized the dots with each other that it &apos;s just about a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my life , my single goal in life , a good father .
i was the miracle of the day , not to die in this day .
i got another gift to see that , which is to see in the future , and coming back and come in different ways .
my call all of all that is flying today , imagine , imagine that &apos;s the same thing that happens in your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they spend because they think they &apos;re always there forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , you &apos;re the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is quite straightforward .
we don &apos;t want to make the iran .
the most important thing there is the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
if you can now do the systems of <unk> , which are <unk> and the <unk> of the control , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these are <unk> boxes running with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on another technology .
but if we can do it , that &apos;s an effective <unk> on a laptop <unk> that &apos;s used by a <unk> , to <unk> the gray box , and then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will be in the gray box box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> , <unk> <unk> , mission <unk> .
it &apos;s a piece of <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found this .
when we started doing our research on six months , was absolutely unknown , what was the purpose of the purpose and purpose of this .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most difficult part of the most difficult part , and he made by <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed like something <unk> , with these <unk> boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
so the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project that we saw our environment with <unk> infected and examined this .
and then something weird happened .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , it didn &apos;t eat it .
that made my eyes no sense .
and after we had to work with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is an <unk> attack .
completely on a particular destination .
the <unk> <unk> activated in the gray box of the gray box , when a special configuration is discovered , even if the special program that &apos;s going to do is trying to hang on .
and if not , then , <unk> nothing .
so , the really really interest , my interest and we started working , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , let &apos;s say , a <unk> american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon find out what the objective is .
so , <unk> and <unk> we got the <unk> code and found out that he &apos;s in two digital journal -- a smaller and a larger .
and also , we noticed that they were very professional , from people who had gotten all of the information available to all of the information .
they knew all bits and <unk> that they needed to attack .
and probably even even the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the <unk> of the <unk> complex and high-tech is <unk> , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines .
looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were smart from this code .
so after all , we were looking for the first thing , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this is .
and then we looked at <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or not to see .
so to put these theories , we call ourselves that it definitely is about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to act in iran because there &apos;s most of the infections that most of the infections are reported .
well , in this area , there are not several thousand targets .
so basically it &apos;s going on to the <unk> nuclear power of nuclear power and <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to get a list of all of the experts for <unk> and power power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called her and <unk> her knowledge to compare their expertise to compare their expertise to compare in the actual code and into the data .
and that worked very well .
so it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the speed is moving inside of the centrifuge , these black objects that you see .
and if you &apos;re the speed of this <unk> , you actually actually get the speed of the rotor to the speed , and eventually , the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve done is that the goal was actually , it was slowly to be slow to it , it &apos;s obvious to <unk> <unk> , obviously in trying to make the <unk> <unk> , so that they &apos;re not going to be able to get quickly .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a glimpse of the very same data , and <unk> very much .
so for example , the number of <unk> are very promising out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to <unk> scientific literature , how these <unk> were built into <unk> and found out that they are <unk> in <unk> , and each <unk> has been <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it would fit .
and it was getting better .
these <unk> in iran are in <unk> <unk> .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the <unk> ?
so a almost identical structure .
so again , that really fits really good .
and this was given us big confidence for this we studied .
now , don &apos;t you know me wrong , not just that .
these results were reached through several weeks work .
and often we just put it into a <unk> and we had to see ourselves .
we found that both of the digital lectures actually actually dropped on a one and the same goal , but it &apos;s from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and <unk> the branches and slowed them down and slow and slow the big <unk> <unk> <unk> with six <unk> and <unk> .
so , in big , we &apos;re very confident we &apos;ve actually determined that we have surely what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be made by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- actually , really , really , really , really , really , really , i &apos;m out of the <unk> .
there &apos;s the gray box box , and the top you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is doing is that the <unk> values of sensors -- so the <unk> values and <unk> -- and there &apos;s <unk> code to be the attack , with the <unk> data , the <unk> data , is running as the attack , with the <unk> data .
and in fact , this is the <unk> <unk> data .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where during the <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> fed with the <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> <unk> in the control of the control .
in fact , there &apos;s much more dangerous and more efficient .
the idea is to be a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t be fast enough .
so in a plant station , for example , if the big <unk> becomes rapidly , you need to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this is not going to be done by a human being done .
so this is what we need digital <unk> .
and if the threat is , then , really bad things happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the <unk> , nor the <unk> , will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have anything in particular with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or a <unk> or a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to the <unk> stick over a <unk> stick , like we saw it in <unk> .
you could use a regular technology to get the spread of the way to the spread .
you just have to spread it as much as you can .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east for the attacks of the middle east .
they are in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas are the most important environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we start to prepare for ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was a lot of that reported that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> of this .
is that your belief is ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think of my opinion is the <unk> involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most important superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would even be bigger .
thank you for a <unk> , thank you ralph . thank you .
i spent the last couple of years , i spent in situations that normally be very difficult and some of the same time somehow .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing like this -- i &apos;m going to eat nothing like this -- i &apos;m happy at the beginning , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career that could be done after most of the time in the process of <unk> situations , and all the only way to explore social , are so compelling that they are compelling and interesting , and hopefully , and hopefully , in a way of a very simple way that they do .
so when i knew that i would come here to come in a tedtalk looking at the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i was a little different .
some of you may have heard of it , i think a couple of weeks ago an ad on ebay .
i sent some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the way to <unk> the <unk> of my tedtalk in 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , had an amazing opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let a -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never allow one lot and not a lot of evidence on that .
so what you got was this : you name this : you name here : my tedtalk , you know , you know , what the subject is going to be the issue , and they &apos;re going to be particularly if i could fly their hands for their own stupid .
but it &apos;s time , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the <unk> .
so despite that warning , i knew that would be the <unk> <unk> .
if you had to have this before one year , i would not have been able to tell you this to you to say this to you .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the commercials of marketing .
as i said , i was going to take a couple of terrible situations in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be so hard and so dangerous as to these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film was funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so what &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , is that everything , from the top , from the beginning to the end , totally with the end , with the end , with the movie , that &apos;s the brand <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center ...
these people are going to be connected to the film in an age -- forever .
and so the film is that this whole idea is looking at -- that &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the ultimate .
it was &quot; in forever , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to be the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;re going to ask you that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we &apos;re going to sell a shoe and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever carried .
the greatest car that they &apos;re ever in danger is from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so the idea is , apart from this , is that brands are a part of life , actually , you know , to finance the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept that &apos;s going to film , from the beginning to the end .
and i would be happy if you could help help help help do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be <unk> people .
now , you have a perspective -- i want to not &quot; look at &quot; point &quot; perspective , because it has a negative <unk> -- but you know how that &apos;s going to be ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it in any case , some really famous brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we see like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think about what the answer is ?
the answer is probably probably &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing for the film or a hard thing to me ?
jk : both .
so ... means not so optimistic .
so , my doctor , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands brands .
yeah .
when you look at people who you see it .
there are some digits that we can turn to .
so put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera was &quot; dignity that we wanted to be a <unk> .
it turned out that it meant to be in reality , &quot; we want to do with her film . &quot;
and just like all the companies disappeared , one after the other .
no wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising is to make your product as many people as possible to present , it &apos;s as many people can see it .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media media and the most powerful media media -- is not the idea of being in this new exciting <unk> that the masses is going to take that the mass .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the way that we did .
actually , it wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that would be no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what &apos;s the picture is , is a problem .
if you look at transparency in the <unk> , this is one of the first images that seems to be the <unk> .
i like to really , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover , and <unk> , and instantly understandable information ; it &apos;s just the biggest problem , which is certainly the biggest problem , is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president , it tells us , even our ceos .
but if it comes to the time that it &apos;s going to be implemented , it changes something .
but why ? well , transparency is fear of <unk> -- like this strange bear , which is still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also a very risky .
what &apos;s going to be a risky ?
a whole <unk> of cool food <unk> .
that &apos;s a very risky .
so when i started to talk to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell them this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell you that you had a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
so , you see , when i was a kid and my father at me , my father was a <unk> -- and there he is looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the story of the story .
but there &apos;s only a company , an authority willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i have john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i found that i had to do the <unk> and i just had to go to the companies and i just had to go through my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start to talk to these companies , the idea , how your brand is understood , is a <unk> problem .
i have friends , the big , giant <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends , the little <unk> like i do .
and my friends , the big , giant <unk> , saying that the reason they &apos;re so successful is so successful , the <unk> is they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , &quot; well , how should we have these big , gigantic private enterprise compete ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see the film in the movie ?
whenever i open up to the way , and always when i open the open , you &apos;ll see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i &apos;m a guy , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are they like ? you know , you &apos;re a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should be a little bit about this interview a little bit . &quot;
and then we &apos;re going to give one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men as well as women who are equipped -- they &apos;re <unk> , or whatever .
that &apos;s the <unk> .
now i can answer your questions and give them a <unk> .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as brand a <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have as a budget like other brands .
so these things are -- you know , remember people &apos;s <unk> -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
in the words , you would describe to you ?
we &apos;re <unk> .
this is a great question .
<unk> technology .
technology is not the way you describe something that someone under the <unk> does .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a super word that these very distinctive really makes a little bit of positive power , unlike &quot; <unk> odor and moisture moisture . &quot;
it &apos;s got fresh .
how can we take it longer fresh -- better fresh , more fresh fresh fresh gas , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what &apos;s wrong with me ? what &apos;s the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man in the street who are like , as i , <unk> .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love to really enjoy beautiful clothes .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> , except for the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is , &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , many <unk> and stuff like that .
but i usually have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and so that .
woman : if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m like , i would say , <unk> fly .
girl 2 : part of a sudden , part of the yogi , part of the <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
boy three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> in all the country , the world &apos;s .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
and there &apos;s four 4 : my brand is fedex because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
does this happen ?
a lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i see the intersection of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed , i was that i needed to have a experts .
i needed somebody who could go inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> helped to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for the thing , they were able to help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this first image . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this thoughts and emotions are connected to me about it .
these are the people who are my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live in , work and so .
all these things come from and start by a place , and i start to start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you about this .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what &apos;s the context of what &apos;s the thought and emotions about it itself ?
it &apos;s like i like to be like to be .
i love things that are different .
i love things that are weird . i love things .
tell me about the &quot; why -- &quot; <unk> -- what do you do ?
what is the <unk> ? what &apos;s the <unk> ? what &apos;s going on ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , you &apos;re not going to be .
what else they have done is they &apos;re going through ?
... it doesn &apos;t have to be frightened . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for their own .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what to do it .
there was a beautiful lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her <unk> two separate <unk> , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand / <unk> brand .
the <unk> are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that &apos;s going to do .
and i think some companies are just going to be limited to a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re scared , they &apos;re scared , and they turn these elements for yourself in a little positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is an classic , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , <unk> , mini , mini of a little <unk> and <unk> .
now , there &apos;s a <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if you ask them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , like , would you be ?
they &apos;re a <unk> ? they &apos;re something that &apos;s blood in <unk> ?
or are you more likely to be a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s a little bit more quiet , more conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , fresh <unk> , fresh <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and agile <unk> like <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , <unk> , magic and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they a <unk> , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate like <unk> ?
are it <unk> , stable , <unk> , safe , all-powerful , holy , <unk> , and wise what the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who are up and <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> that they &apos;re not going to be part of the project .
they were really trying to do anything with this film because they didn &apos;t control control , no control of the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 <unk> who were ready to give up to the <unk> that with someone businesses wanted to be businesses with someone businesses and playful as i , and the finally , we don &apos;t have to tell stories -- stories that would never support support .
they <unk> us , the story of the <unk> to tell how we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using <unk> , to the <unk> of the brain , both of the brain &apos;s brain <unk> , both of ads in the brain .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no <unk> , no posters , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school where companies are going to go through the schools in the west , in america , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of whom i got to be given most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what these tags did .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said that the agencies might not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think is that our way is to think that our view are going forward .
and how did it do for you ? what it does ?
well , there &apos;s the film that we had the <unk> film festival , we can look at this time .
according to <unk> , the first time in january , and it &apos;s got -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
this is just one of two one &apos;s time by two-thirds .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be .
there &apos;s no one online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s not in other countries .
well , finally , the film is a very big momentum .
and this is not a bad thing for a project , which almost every <unk> we were talking about , their customers , that fingers .
something that i think is that if you take a chance of taking your extra chance , the risks that are in these risks .
i think if you get people from it , you &apos;re going to take it closer to it .
i think that when you &apos;re training to his staff , we get risks to avoid the whole company to acquire a profit .
i feel the feeling that we need to do when we need to encourage people .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of options that you might recognize .
finally , we should be scared of the progress .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome to fear . they &apos;re welcome to risk .
each one &apos;s big , full of the , is that we welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
nowadays , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of a very miserable honesty .
and that &apos;s what i said , &quot; honesty and transparency , my whole whole talk , &quot; hot welcome &quot; was that by my good friends of <unk> , the $ <unk> for the <unk> on ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations all around the world in large opportunities .
<unk> presents : &quot; hot transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , this is what &apos;s going on with the $ $ <unk> ?
this is a great question .
i put a check in my pocket , the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in the <unk> of dollars to finance my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
i made a little different at the google &apos;s day , and i was <unk> to me about a little bit of museums and art that my <unk> , and my <unk> , which is , gave me a green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories i can tell you , at 17 , i can tell you about 17 .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very easy to be very simple with this slide and your access .
i grew up in india .
i was given a great education of the day -- i don &apos;t <unk> myself -- but i had a lot of museums and this artwork , and this artwork is not access .
when i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot to learn a lot .
and while i was working on google , i was trying to make this desire -- art process -- technology together .
we then engineer a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you &apos;re going to tell you some interesting things that happened for the beginning .
so you go to the <unk> .
you can look around in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , van gogh .
i &apos;m actually going to come into one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- bombay , mexico , mexico , doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and <unk> .
they want to be in the museum ?
open the card , and you jump off a click .
in fact , they &apos;re going to want to go to the end of the gangs .
just on . great fun .
look at them .
thank you , but the best one is .
so i &apos;m a <unk> student , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the museum , you click on it .
this is now one of the images .
these are all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click on here -- but i &apos;m going to throw it away .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been doing with the so-called <unk> .
this picture for example , is about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can get very easily in and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is a <unk> .
but then they really want deep in .
and so i started to play around , and i realized that there &apos;s something going to go .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to get close , and slowly , the kids that actually put these kids in this kids .
i was a little bit , i spoke to some famous famous in the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> with a stick on a stick .
it seems to be quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they were doing , but i learned something about it .
to really close , you can go to the roaring .
just to give you the <unk> , i &apos;m going to see you so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s go to the moma jump , again in new york .
another <unk> of me , <unk> .
so , in the previous example , it was about to find detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what &apos;s going to happen when you want to see the van &apos;s <unk> <unk> ?
you <unk> in it . you can go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite <unk> of this slide , until i really have to go out .
that &apos;s <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there &apos;s another lot of other , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part of it , it &apos;s called her .
everyone of them , every one -- whether rich or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t play .
you can create it , online , you can create your own museum -- from all these pictures , you can put your own collection of your own collection .
just you go in there -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; , in the <unk> .
you can put it all up with a <unk> , your friends , and so a conversation start about what they feel like , if you look at this image .
i think , in the end , i think , is the main thing that all the wonderful things here is not google .
they come from my view of view , not even from the museums .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience of humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be a digital medium medium of art , and they &apos;re working on online .
and this is the biggest question that i recently asked to do : &quot; do you have this to be able to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s how it goes . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be in two layers .
that &apos;s the one on the left half that is the logical side , and then the right half that the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of the tree , we could be able to visualize your brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s fully logical .
this is somebody who &apos;s fully intuitive .
now , where would you be your brain at that scale ?
some of us may have thought of one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , you &apos;re looking at this -- with a high <unk> , which is the same thing in both of the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both <unk> or so on .
you can logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , in the most other experimental <unk> that have a good number of logic that has a good number of logic together .
but at the same time we need a good fraction of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love it with things .
so we go out and play and play like it , and then you start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the time you &apos;ve evolved over the years , is probably a thing to be at the same time .
i mean , it may sound strange about thinking that one thing at the same time in two different locations is , but they were not born with this idea , they have evolved .
i remember a kid in the <unk> of a <unk> .
he was still a toddler and not very good at it , and he fell constantly .
but i bet it &apos;s going to play this with the <unk> community of a very valuable lesson , which is the big thing you can &apos;t just let you go and get it to one place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little weird particles .
and if you &apos;re going to play with their particles , they &apos;re all sorts of weird things -- like they &apos;re going to fly directly through walls , or they can be in the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote that observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
and that was the physics in physics a few years ago , and you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little bit of the little particles .
but you don &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
so this is not just like my intuition , and it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t like that often play with the particles .
well , i don &apos;t play a little bit of them with them , but not quite often .
and i haven &apos;t seen them yet .
i mean , nobody has seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t like it .
because if all things are made of particles and all these particles , all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , not simply all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this is not supposed to be .
so i would love to the <unk> better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that , <unk> also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago , right now .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer chip chip .
and you can see that green dot there is in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
so here i &apos;m going to get something that . we &apos;re looking at right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , like a springboard and it &apos;s shaped over the edge .
so i made this thing on the similar way that you do a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to take this as a <unk> pool of the hole and the thing that &apos;s going to get .
this thing has been the ability to be in the <unk> <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
so , look at an analogy . let me give you an example .
you know , how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people go and i hear other people and i hear all these things because i don &apos;t want to talk about it , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so , quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are equally as .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not just people but the light that looks like it , and the light is that it looks like , and the wind , which is the heat of you and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal would like this piece of metal , we had to get all the <unk> out of the whole <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we have the light off , put it into a vacuum and <unk> it all the air , and it &apos;s <unk> until almost the <unk> , it was on the elevator , it was the piece of metal free to behave like that .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really was strange .
instead of being able to just get it out there , it &apos;s <unk> . the way it was like <unk> was about like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
we gave him a little push , we could get it to the same time , and not to vibrate -- something which is just in the mechanics of the mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to show you about is what &apos;s really awesome .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time , and not to screw up ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms are the piece of atoms that are the piece of metal , and at the same time , they move the same atoms on and off .
just to see the <unk> voices voices .
the rest of the time are they <unk> .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is the same thing that &apos;s all the metal in the two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year into the clean room , because , check that the <unk> between one individual atom and that piece metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if one atom can be in two different locations at the same time , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you do it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side is .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would you handle that handle that your body is <unk> in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece of a piece .
and so i had to design this new intuition that it looks like , if all the objects in the elevator are really <unk> objects that are in a small room .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s still more of it , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them around them , literally , who are they &apos;re , and this is the <unk> and strange quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> , how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about it , where they live and work , you know , the opportunity to pick up between at least one hand of a hand full of different cities , all the way in competition .
at the moment we &apos;re far from this goal .
there &apos;s billions of people in developing countries that are not even a single city of the available to the developing ones that they welcome to .
but the amazing thing is that they &apos;re so much more worth that they are so much more worth than it costs them .
so we could actually see the world very simple with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you never have to have a new towns of time .
they &apos;re just doing it from homes against the cities .
imagine that half of people are like to live in houses , this is already , but the other half are not .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing existing apartments .
but you know what you would be doing to do , in these homes , their own obligation to avoid the <unk> of preventing everyone and from the <unk> .
so it turns out , as a very difficult , all of these kind of <unk> .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block , that will be the laws that would support you and support it to it .
so i proposed that governments are creating new spaces that have enough place for a city , and gave them a name : <unk> cities .
later i &apos;ve found that , for example , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year was about 75,000 <unk> <unk> their land around the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to do to ask , that these people could stay in their country and do the same thing in the course .
at this point , <unk> <unk> , said , &quot; what happens when we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , what if we just want to get a message of a part of the american embassy , which is a part of the canadian message and when people are working under the canadian rules or the ones of this point , you can go there . &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , cyclone <unk> was severe <unk> .
in the next elections , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a <unk> surround , its program both pioneered both of the things , as well , <unk> promised .
he was going to be <unk> <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared myself to talk about a talk at tedglobal .
through improving , you know , and by the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to use this complicated concept of the <unk> city of the <unk> city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be <unk> and <unk> .
we &apos;re giving new technologies for new drugs , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws . and they &apos;re usually the laws that are going to help us .
in the fall , a friend sent me a friend of guatemala <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
so the turn was <unk> .
so the two call me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to our country . &quot;
so we met in december of the <unk> of a hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear how valuable cities are how much more frequently they are when they cost them .
and i used this graph to show how precious <unk> is to be a place like new york . think of that area in some cases per square meter per square , thousands of dollars is worth worth of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , when it was a <unk> discussion , <unk> said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the ted scientist made a very simple shape , that &apos;s an <unk> city , whose beginning is a place that &apos;s the beginning of the beginning , a <unk> , which is the opportunity to choose either under these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of the council of peace , who meant that we need to realize that we need to realize that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s getting into the way .
i was asked to <unk> <unk> , and i was going to keep the fourth and fifth of january and fifth .
so i have another talk about facts <unk> , who is a graphic like this , which is trying to make sure that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is built the new airport that was built in <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s just the airport alone , a surface of 100 .
so i try to convince the <unk> of it , if you want to build a new city , you &apos;re going to start with an area of at least 1,000 .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
hi all the <unk> .
the audience of the audience were very serious and attention .
the head of the magazine came on the stage , and she said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much , but maybe we could see the tedtalk .
i put it on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and you have the tedtalk .
and i came to the conclusion that a new city is going to give up new possibilities .
there was a chance to live in a city that would be in peace , rather than hundreds of miles away from north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the executives executives were used to liberate the aid from <unk> depended on the aid of <unk> that they could benefit from the <unk> of the laws that they would support in the action for the charter and to which we would support in order to the <unk> .
and the fact that we <unk> from president <unk> , that the <unk> of the <unk> was about the <unk> of making this foreign investors to build and to build the city of all the years of fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area in danger .
this is the picture of this place .
it &apos;s a <unk> thousand miles .
and shortly after that , the 19th of january , they have to be in the congress for a change of the constitution , to have a <unk> policy policy that &apos;s <unk> for particular <unk> .
in a country that &apos;s just a controversial crisis , in which congress was elected to the congress for these <unk> with <unk> .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be twice the way it &apos;s been approved by congress .
on february 17th , it was a second time to be <unk> <unk> .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24 of february , the delegation of about 30 <unk> of the world that most of them were interested in the world that were most of interest in the business of the <unk> .
the one place is south .
this is a picture of a large , new urban urban urban , which is built in south korea <unk> , big than the urban <unk> .
everything you can see in this picture was taken over four years after it took four years to get the permits to get the needy .
the other place that was very , very , very , very , is singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you see in this way , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; and you think this area for the second city for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that allows you to participate , and it &apos;s also also about a external system .
a country has been offered its supreme court for a supreme court for a court for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system .
and also , <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually even get funding with a .
one thing you know , as you know , we &apos;ve been there lots of <unk> .
there are many of the companies that would like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live in there .
over the world , there are 700 million people who say they would like to live in another place to another place .
a million people have left every year in latin america and <unk> in the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to be forced to sometimes their families to sometimes sometimes <unk> their families that have to make enough money to eat and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes kids who try to find their parents , they &apos;re trying to find their parents in some cases , since a decade .
so what &apos;s so it is for an idea to think about building a whole new city ?
or even <unk> of these cities , or hundreds of these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what &apos;s so it is for an idea that every family has a choice between a few cities that are in competition to new inhabitants ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends of immigrants asked me to tell me thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you make it in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a poll with over 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions that are <unk> on the <unk> of a day .
and also , recently , was a study of ceos with ceos in which they were the ceos of the ceos .
and these scientists have been just the different topics that we documented and these ceos documented and how much time they make it decision to meet the issues that are involved with the issues .
and they &apos;ve found that a average of a <unk> <unk> is busy work with <unk> assignments .
each of these issues , of course , from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were making in a nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their choices needed an hour or more of their time .
think about their own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of meeting for the one hour , over an hour ?
how good , think they &apos;re making decisions that are the decisions that are making decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some of these kinds of things .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to give you some questions , and i want to know you some questions .
if i ask you a question , they &apos;re going to raise , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask them , if i ask you a question , and you answer your answer , so my first question is : are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a university at stanford university , i went to this very much <unk> store ; at least at the time he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we had to actually have <unk> .
i loved it to this business , but i asked to a moment i &apos;d ask myself , well , how do you get something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil olive oil , including those who were locked in camps , the thousand years old .
so i decided to visit one day of the leader , and i asked the head , &quot; work that people really want to really have all these options ? &quot;
and he showed the <unk> of tourists who had usually come every day and usually their cameras had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gang .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we put a little <unk> right at the entrance &apos;s entrance .
we have six different tastes or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i think would be more people going to stand up and <unk> ?
it &apos;s more people are left , if it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we saw ourselves in the case people &apos;s got a glass <unk> bought .
now we saw the <unk> effect .
the people who were left to be 24 than it were 24 , they bought three percent in the glass of a glass .
by the people who are left when they were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually actually bought a glass of <unk> .
well , if you do it , the people bought six times a glass of <unk> who had six to the choice of having six to the choice of 24 .
now , not to decide not to buy a glass <unk> , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> is also in very <unk> decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is : save the resource .
i &apos;m going to describe you now a study i &apos;m with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re making decisions on the retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 , of about 650 plans in the entire states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of the <unk> that could be a <unk> possible , the <unk> plan that will affect whether it &apos;s saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a relationship in the fact that there was a relationship .
so this plans we had about <unk> plans to bring the people out of something between two to the <unk> of the <unk> .
and what we found was that the more organized was offered to be offered that , in fact , the participation rate was low .
if you look at the extremes , the plans that two fund , the plans that had offered two fund , a <unk> in the <unk> -- still not as high as we want to .
in the plans that almost 60 fund , the <unk> <unk> is now <unk> on about the <unk> <unk> .
now , it turns out that even if you could enter yourself in the <unk> , if you were more options , even has to be negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the people who decided to participate , they had more options and fund them and fund them .
the more options were used to them , the more options they have all of their whole money in pure <unk> .
no of these extreme decisions , is to make the decision that someone would recommend someone if you recommend their future well-being .
well , in the last 10 years , we have three of the negative consequences of the brain that are going to offer three and more choices with each more and more choices .
they make the decision -- they pin them , even if it &apos;s against her own best .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- and poor cash and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re willing to decide to make them less happy that they even when they make it better .
the reason that this is , we may be able to take these giant shelves of <unk> , mustard , <unk> , <unk> , but we don &apos;t actually capture the comparison and isotopes and regulations , and then actually something that can be fantastic for fantastic .
so what i want to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve been tested in different ways and on various <unk> -- they can use it in their business .
first of all .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as a today that less more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; listen . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing losing losing .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to go and get the <unk> opportunities , well , then we have a increase of carbon dioxide , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a decline of <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble , the various head and <unk> <unk> <unk> of 26 percent , you know , you &apos;ve got a increase of sales about 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation corporation , you know , 10 at the worst of the worst <unk> <unk> , she was <unk> that the revenues of 87 percent -- a result of the rise of the sales and the reduction of the cost .
you know , the average <unk> today is going to show you about 45,000 products .
so a typical walmart gives you 100,000 products on .
but the <unk> supermarket , who is now <unk> the world &apos;s <unk> supermarket , and they &apos;re only giving them to be 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a <unk> .
now in the world , i think i think one of the best examples that recently come on the market , about how to the best choices , was something that david <unk> has been very powerful at harvard . it &apos;s a program that &apos;s at harvard .
every single harvard , <unk> <unk> is a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice of 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to make it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the people to the staff is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are apart from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to <unk> them , they can &apos;t . &quot;
well before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to all people in this audience <unk> <unk> to the most beautiful road in this audience .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you to you .
and i give you a couple of seconds to read them , and i &apos;m going to get them to clap when you &apos;re willing to take a <unk> .
okay . everybody &apos;s willing to take a <unk> .
are all the ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i might have more of the hands .
well .
the fact that you think it was looking at the first time more information than the second time , but i would make it a car that it &apos;s the second time .
because the pictures had made it for you .
and what &apos;s next to me is that the second technology is going to help them with the problem of the problem , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people who understand the difference between understanding of ways to understand the consequences of the individual , and that these consequences are vivid and may be very specific .
why spend people on average 15 to 30 percent more than they &apos;re a <unk> or a card card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really make it money .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels like , it &apos;s a very good tool that you make people to save more .
so we have a study that i made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- the staff who worked for <unk> -- and these people were all done in a gathering in which they signed their participation for their <unk> .
and during those meetings , we &apos;ve just like these places exactly how they always have , we have a little added .
the thing that we have in the <unk> is that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives , if they save money .
we did this simple thing , we had a rise of participation , and it was about 20 percent of the participation that were willing to save , or a increase of the number of people who were willing to save for the <unk> .
third technology : <unk> .
we can better with more categories than more than more choices .
here &apos;s an example , for example , we &apos;ve done in a <unk> <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> up in the northeast of the area , the number of <unk> different kinds of magazines to <unk> different kinds of magazines up until <unk> .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you can show them to 10 categories of <unk> , or i put them 400 papers in 20 categories , and then they believe that i had more selection and a better <unk> than i gave them to 600 to you .
because the categories tell me how i can take it apart .
so here are two different <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and &quot; the other &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left is <unk> , and the ad on the right is jazz , then clap in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one who &apos;s jazz is <unk> , then you clap .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories need to say something about the <unk> saying something that &apos;s going to work .
and this problem often often , if you look at the long points of all this .
who are actually trying to figure out ?
my fourth technology : a revelation for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s make a very , very complicated decision , buy a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> that gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely even <unk> .
you have to make it by making 62 different decisions to design their car .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they &apos;re going to offer a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i was 56 .
<unk> , you can -- four possibilities .
so what i &apos;m doing is i &apos;m going to change the order in the decision-making .
half of the clients is going to be a lot of opportunities from many ways , <unk> <unk> , four gears .
the other half of the clients are about the worse , four pathways , four pathways , to the <unk> , many possibilities .
what i &apos;m looking at ?
how are they interested .
if you use the <unk> decision to make the decision , that they &apos;re overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find out is that the people who are going to stay from many of the many things they &apos;re always going to go and keep the <unk> vote again and again .
we &apos;re losing them .
they &apos;re from the little choice to the many , they will stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did was the order of the order that is presented to this information is presented .
if i start with the simple approach , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m <unk> .
even though the data is to pick up the gears and nothing about my preferences in the field , i still get it to pick up .
it &apos;s also <unk> me in a long way about the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be interested in interest .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told them by four techniques that the problem of <unk> <unk> -- are going to be the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- they &apos;re more real ; -- -- -- we -- we can better with more categories , less possibilities .
so every of these techniques that i &apos;m going to show you today is to help you the possibility of making the choices -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for people who are making service .
because i think the key to the best is that you &apos;re being <unk> by the selection .
and the more we pick up the choice , the better will be able to practice better , the arts of the decision .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> on youtube . i &apos;m looking at the <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then they &apos;re so important .
we all want to be looking at star -- <unk> , singers , comedians -- when i was a young , that &apos;s an infinite response .
but <unk> , that we all have done , or all of our creative activities are going to be famous for a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to be famous .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours video video per minute uploaded a minute .
it &apos;s going to only one tiny percentage of ever <unk> and thousands of times , and so , and so on the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> of this video that he photographed his house in the yosemite national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national national
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like , when the video was popular last summer .
actually , <unk> <unk> no viral video .
he just wanted to share a <unk> .
because you just do that , if you <unk> <unk> mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually sent to january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video ended , the video was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , let &apos;s ask new things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , and you didn &apos;t think that we could lead this conversation without talking about this video , i hope you &apos;d run this conversation without talking about this video .
rebecca <unk> <unk> is one of the popular video of the year .
it was nearly 200 million times .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; it seems to be there .
what &apos;s happened to this day ?
well , it was friday .
if you want to know about it , these other spikes are also <unk> .
but what &apos;s happened with this day , that particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of blogs started to write about this .
michael <unk> : nelson science theater theater was one first to twitter , which is a joke that was a joke at twitter .
so , what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> has a place to shared a position , with a large audience shared and <unk> the process .
and then these community <unk> , these big <unk> shared , and starting to talk about and playing with it .
now , 10,000 <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
already in the first seven days , it was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the 20th entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment , the part of the 20th century is part of the community -- either by the community -- either by the way we get to get it or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; animation <unk> , &quot; is animation and music .
it &apos;s just , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s what you &apos;d like to be crazy , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> that has been looked at four million times .
even cats can look at this video .
cats look at cats who are watching this video .
so important creativity is that creativity is in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there were <unk> .
somebody has made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
all the <unk> shot out of the ground that it &apos;s made of a silly joke that we all participate in .
now we don &apos;t find a simple pleasure today to find something we do .
who would have all the way that ?
who would have &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or &quot; rebecca black or &quot; <unk> black or &quot; <unk> &quot; can predict &quot; <unk> ?
what <unk> would you write their write in which is what they &apos;re doing ?
in a world where every minute two days , two days , just really unique , and unexpected and unexpected <unk> like the previous video .
i admit i was not a very interesting interest when i said a friend , i &apos;m supposed to look at this great video , and over a fellow , in new york for parking traffic .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not standing on the <unk> threats , but often there &apos;s a disability that doesn &apos;t get a really nice to the <unk> .
there was this very surprising and humorous , casey was casey <unk> , and his argument was <unk> , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for all new things we do .
and that &apos;s all going to lead us to the big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , totally unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to each and in the audience .
as i said , one of the most biggest stars are the biggest star -- justin beaver -- made his beginning to youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas to your ideas .
and today , we &apos;re all like to be as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not going to meet the media from today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the discussion between women over three minutes , and how the amazing strength of this <unk> connection is to <unk> a four-year-old <unk> than she died about 30 years with her little girl , and an connection that was in san francisco and a moment before you &apos;re talking about ?
the story is not going to be .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put .
i want to tell you some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece of : a man who &apos;s <unk> his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man who had a whole life of the whole of hope of unity and freedom of his home .
hold it on the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> eyes , like it has to be expected to admit that his life was a single waste .
so the words , so long his friends , <unk> now .
he moved into silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never ever let me ever forget .
i had to worry that it was not for free to it , and it was my job , learning that the story was , was it trying to be us , we &apos;re .
the next <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> are <unk> on lake <unk> .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , two little girls .
for she had a job , you had a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely keen that they could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat , quiet <unk> , a boat , as <unk> .
all the adults were conscious .
the greatest fear was she had been <unk> , rape and death .
like most of the adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> .
at a <unk> , my sister had only got my sister and i , and she , then she &apos;s <unk> and my grandmother &apos;s .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the motor , that &apos;s going to clap one every wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , the many times came , but the <unk> of the men on the boat are actually <unk> on the same <unk> or the <unk> of the engine that &apos;s six to not .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> coast of the coast , and the young man who collapsed the <unk> and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the flavor of the first <unk> that gave me a <unk> .
no apple ever ever .
after three months in a refugee camp , we ended in in melbourne in melbourne in melbourne .
and the next thing about four women are in three generations that are together creating a new life .
we went down to <unk> down , one of the most recent <unk> <unk> , whose population is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no <unk> .
the <unk> came out of the <unk> coming out of the rest of the world .
and the <unk> of the <unk> were given between people who had shared one thing together : they started new .
my mom was working on farms , then in a <unk> <unk> , six days , six layers of <unk> .
it was a way of finding the time to be english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every one dollar was given , and she was in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for that , most of the time , the new things that came out of the time .
two pair of <unk> for school , each one to the holes , to cover the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to do six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here , and there &apos;s <unk> : &quot; raw , goes home . &quot;
after home where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was an meeting to the reconciliation and a quiet voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to you from the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mom was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other of our day , and listened to the motions of our grandmother in the house .
my mom suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job , every night awake , until her <unk> came to the <unk> , so i could <unk> her .
she opened a <unk> , then , then a <unk> and a business and a business .
and the women came with their stories over men who don &apos;t <unk> change , angry and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
loans and sponsor were looking for .
<unk> centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one i was the classic asian student , the <unk> <unk> itself .
in the other , i was in <unk> life , the tragic wave of violence carrying up , the <unk> and the <unk> .
but so many of the years of aid .
and because of that aid , i was going to be the <unk> year of the <unk> as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was being from a <unk> to the next , and the <unk> didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , was <unk> le , refugee and social activist , who had never heard of , and in houses that she never had heard .
i didn &apos;t know the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into the class and the convenience of life of an unknown <unk> back -- a grandmother , a mom and two daughters who were told every one of their days as well as 20 years , by telling each other , and <unk> , we still got three to the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do this .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was when we put the boat .
no one was never had a clue .
&quot; just do it simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about <unk> and education , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more more than the more open i was talking , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , they were in the limits of the possible .
and although i had my degree , i realized that i could not be able to put myself in a career in <unk> .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay , a musician <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the image -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful for you might be a gift of the <unk> .
because it can make it easy to the <unk> of the <unk> , so easily that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i went out enough to know enough of my <unk> , to know that , yes , the world &apos;s <unk> , but not as you get it .
opportunities that were not allowed to have been resolved .
there was a energy , an optimism optimism , a more conceptual optimism of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut .
i gathered a little team of people to me , to the <unk> , &quot; not &quot; a <unk> challenge .
a year , we had no cents .
on the end of a <unk> , i took a huge <unk> soup that we shared .
we worked till the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were a few brilliant and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to the u.s. and the u.s.
just a journey there .
my gut self .
three months later , i was moved to moved and the adventure went on .
before i <unk> the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she was growing up in the <unk> social norm and the local <unk> and the local <unk> of the most important person .
life had not changed since centuries .
her father died in a short time after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
at 17 , she was the second woman of a <unk> mother whose mother was <unk> .
no support of their husband , she was worried for a <unk> , by taking him in front of trial and <unk> in her own , and another greater than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t be &quot; proved . &quot;
i was just <unk> in a hotel room , when she died , a thousand miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked through the <unk> and looked at them .
i knew that she was coming to .
my mother rang me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a temple temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk> .
we told her stories and <unk> her , we were in the fact that we were .
and he came to midnight , he came up to the <unk> and he said he &apos;s going to close the <unk> .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s holding them tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t have a <unk> . &quot;
if there is a band in our family , it &apos;s just through the women .
and you see who we were and how life evolved us , we can now see that the men that might come in our lives , we were going to be used to the <unk> .
the defeat would be just .
now i &apos;d like my own children , and i think i &apos;m going to take the boat .
who would ever be a wish ?
yeah , i scared , was a scared of <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the <unk> of every wave of <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the motor , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t have anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this to this , and you could make it safe , i would do it .
and also , <unk> mother is today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all the way ?
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with his camera .
but i started interested in photography , when i was my first digital camera , at age 15 years old .
i put it with my former <unk> for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because the camera was the way that the camera was in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more to photography , right ?
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s going to start when it &apos;s going to cause the trigger .
photos like this : a construction table along a lot of <unk> street .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and <unk> still , a realistic level .
or photos like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all the one with the shared desire to keep an realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean , i &apos;m <unk> .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something that you can really , but i want to look like that , as if you could have this , you know , on a photograph .
photos that you have to think about a brief moment to find the trick out .
so it &apos;s more about , an idea , a really moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what does the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be on a two-dimensional area , and how it can make it on a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is for realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a <unk> reality where you can take different pieces and can recombine to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all identify in a three-dimensional world that we all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , they can combine something that &apos;s still in creating a <unk> that &apos;s still looked at it as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we &apos;re so <unk> our brains , because our brain just won &apos;t make sense .
and i see the same process in the <unk> of the lens .
it &apos;s really just about different realities .
so the things that look like a look like a realistic image , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about it in our daily life .
if we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they &apos;re just kind of <unk> .
so i would say that there &apos;s three simple rules to follow the <unk> results to get a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special pictures .
and then you combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that having pictures have the same perspective .
secondly , photos have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures are these two assets , they &apos;re shot at the same height , and the same <unk> .
third is it &apos;s about it , it &apos;s impossible to make it possible , where the individual images will start and end by creating it seamlessly .
it &apos;s not possible to say how the photo was being made .
so by using color , contrast and contrast to the edges of these individual images , photographic <unk> , like <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the boundaries between the various images and let them look like a single picture of a <unk> can .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s just a landscape that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part is being manipulated .
this picture is actually completely composed , from pictures of different places .
i personally <unk> that it is easier to create a place where a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise the compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires much planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed to take a couple of months to plan to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the jigsaw .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the bank is one of another place .
the <unk> was made of a quarry .
and yes , i went to the house on the island red <unk> to make it <unk> .
to make a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s actually from me to <unk> .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very well planned .
and if you make good footage , the result is pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so these are all tools there are there , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why this is so many electronic <unk> .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped to talk to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced to the <unk> is to make a <unk> .
and they &apos;re not particularly scientific , and she &apos;s making a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient , families , relatives , , &quot; how does it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems that all -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> is sometimes fail : because we stopped listening .
so this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button , and it &apos;s like .
and every morning i got it .
and yes , i have a job , as you can see .
i have my job with 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i get to the scale , you send your data on google health .
and there are also going to be <unk> by my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and it &apos;s not just the moment that i &apos;m going to help you or have to take a look at the past .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with the 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump up to my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; lunch would be a little salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is what &apos;s going to happen , which is because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it could be patients that smoking smoking .
it could be used to people to get people out of their <unk> , and they get them together to play together , playing some way to control their health .
next week is coming up to the market .
it will give you little <unk> that you &apos;re on an iphone or so <unk> .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to send it to your doctor and to send it to the other , for a little more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patient will come into play . they can &apos;t just take control , the captain on their own ship , but also in the challenge of health care , the challenges that we are , and the <unk> of the health care , for the end , etc .
do they make it easy to use the light and start them to hug patients in the team .
and that can also reach through these kinds of ways , but also through .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we all have <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all these are atms around the <unk> around the world .
we know one where all the gas gas is .
and we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next <unk> was in the moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where it &apos;s when he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes it is <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> , already in the netherlands , they were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps that we find .
and we have a <unk> designed .
we have developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone &apos;s going to be a <unk> you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , it &apos;s also <unk> to the next <unk> that can save life .
and we don &apos;t want to know this as a <unk> , as a <unk> product , but also as a <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us to help us behave like <unk> to <unk> these <unk> around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody &apos;s going to be a <unk> , it &apos;s your own blood <unk> or somebody else , you can find that you can find a <unk> .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies are all going to us to do that , to us , is that companies are helping us to help us do this .
and this could be <unk> , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the <unk> is still <unk> .
please help us and try to improve health health care just to make something better , but to take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to make us protect the environment by making it ...
... it &apos;s actually getting attention to the <unk> .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take until it is it until it is .
now , we can just skip that , i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a few years ago i started a program to take the star in technology and design a year , and working in a environment that &apos;s so much of what they really do , we have to work with them .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the <unk> for the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to vote every year we &apos;re a few fellows and we &apos;re working with <unk> .
instead of send them into the third world , we &apos;re sending them into <unk> .
and there were great apps that they created great apps with urban collaborators .
but what you really do is to show is what &apos;s going to happen today .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city boston .
here &apos;s how he looks after a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s really looking at him when he &apos;s <unk> because he &apos;s <unk> because he &apos;s <unk> because he &apos;s been <unk> by a foot snow .
how did he come up with this particular way ?
we had a team last year of birth in boston to the <unk> of the world &apos;s code .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s been much more <unk> .
and they realized that the city never got this fire hydrant free .
but one of the time , a man named erik <unk> , who was found another thing , and that was that the <unk> <unk> of the sidewalks were free to the <unk> , right before you share this .
so he did what everyone would do was , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> to him free , if it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that you &apos;ve written in last year .
but she does something that no other <unk> does .
it &apos;s going to be moving .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> town in the city &apos;s largest <unk> division , which is that he could use this app , not for snow , but to bring it to the citizen <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but the people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to check them .
and then , seattle seattle , the app of the app to clean the citizens to clean the <unk> .
and chicago has been just introduced to the people who &apos;s <unk> when it <unk> <unk> .
we know now nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and she &apos;s being distributed , organic , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s usually not going to happen .
the <unk> of software is actually taking a few years .
we had a team that last year on a project in boston , for three people needed a half and two months .
it was about a way to figure out with the parents who are the right public schools for the right public schools .
we were told later that if it would go over the normal channels of the normal channels it would have been over two years and it would have over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california &apos;s ecological , which is the cost for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then you can see it &apos;s spread from <unk> , a kind of shot before the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private companies , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access to this means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , they &apos;re represented a new generation , the problem of government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution -- not as a problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively , in order to get things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; the code for america , &quot; fellows for america , who are getting up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t have given the government .
they &apos;re so frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about them , they fix them .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all agree your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things that we forget about is the government , in the nucleus of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do is we do not alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you &apos;re because things are changing because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government is ultimately , their power of us -- <unk> , &quot; we &apos;re people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought it was mainly in the government to vote people in a office .
now after two years , i went to the conclusion that it &apos;s in the community of the community in front of the community .
this is the call for service and information .
and you come out there , you &apos;re in your city <unk> <unk> .
if you ever have the chance to work in your <unk> call , like our fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you do all -- you will see that people , government , government , because that &apos;s a <unk> in your house .
so scott &apos;s got this <unk> .
he <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official official .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just all doors in your house and you &apos;re very loud and very loud music , and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . and then for scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
in boston , not just a call call just a call .
it &apos;s got an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an actual <unk> -- it &apos;s in fact , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell you if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> is in different .
scott <unk> himself to human .
but it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> , so that anyone can see it .
and in this case , it was a neighbor .
and the next thing we &apos;ve got to get was , &quot; i went across the over , i found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
and the <unk> on the site . went home .
good afternoon , sweet <unk> .
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the way that we &apos;re in .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not just my here not necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help to help others .
a citizen helped a different citizens , but the government played here in the central role here .
they &apos;re connected to these two people .
and you could have them with the state of <unk> , if it needs to be a neighbor , but a neighbor is a long and cheaper choice to serve services .
if a neighbor is helping to make our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it is that the government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s one of the input of the other .
that &apos;s what we choose to the system that is going to vote .
how many times we have chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy being used to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going back and we expect the amount of energy , our values , our values , and then we have no much changed ?
this is because the government is like a rising ocean and politics are the top of the top .
and what &apos;s below that is what we call the bureaucracy .
and we use this word with these words .
but it &apos;s the kind of weird that we have , and we &apos;re paying for something that &apos;s working on us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work , we have to make it sexy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to be in the government &apos;s open .
so the <unk> did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of <unk> citizens that wrote a very detailed report that &apos;s written on the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not political active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
well , for those of us who have been given the government government , it &apos;s time we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you need to think the enormous challenges you need to ask .
do we really believe that we need to do , without the institution of the institution , we need to improve the name of all of us ?
government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible , the function of the government &apos;s fundamental <unk> in a way that can actually reach something to the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s <unk> <unk> &apos;s internet , and the white internet knows that it &apos;s not so hard to build things together , you need to build it right .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost as a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with , you know , to see their voice as a little bit .
they don &apos;t fight this battle , which we all fight , who are to talk ; they all need to talk .
you can do your mind , everyone in every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care so much about their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that work is better .
and these apps , we make our hands to improve our communities .
that could be , a fire hydrant , weeds , weeds <unk> , a trash trash with a <unk> .
and sure , we would have this fire hydrant all the time , and lots of people do it .
but these apps are like little digital memories , we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of the government who pay pay for them and make it .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government , until we improve the same equal .
so the question i &apos;ve all here is : when it comes to the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we will be a lot of voices , or we &apos;re going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in it is to explain to people like this wonderful new technologies that are being the ones are being , and i thought i &apos;m under the friends and try and understand what &apos;s really quickly about , and we can &apos;t keep going back and understand what &apos;s going on that we can &apos;t keep up .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a very one , boring slide .
... if you &apos;ll just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen to be made of my <unk> .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather the <unk> shape .
this slide shows data from an analysis of us through the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area networks .
so the interesting thing here is that this slide is that this slide , like so many other , which we often find in our field , a sort of a <unk> curve .
in other words , every one step here is a power in the <unk> <unk> .
and this is an novelty that we need this type of scale on the <unk> of the technology of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
and something that &apos;s a little bit brighter , because i &apos;m going to draw something like the paper here .
now , why do we draw the graph in the technology on the <unk> curves ?
the reason that is , if i draw it on a normal graph , where we &apos;re saying that the years are , so the time is a kind of , and this is a matter of a technology of the technology that i want to show with a graph , is silly .
so they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
so if i want to record another technology , we say a <unk> , then that &apos;s on the <unk> scale , a very <unk> <unk> , in a flat line .
but if something like this , then this is the most important thing , then this is the most important thing .
so if the <unk> <unk> so quickly as the <unk> advances , then we could get <unk> into a taxi and we were in a <unk> in tokyo .
but it doesn &apos;t go so fast .
this was never before the history of the <unk> , that sort of <unk> growth , which is the equivalent of the extra few years of exponentially increases the scale of all the few years .
so the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t go forever forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever and forever , as fast as it is evolving .
there are two ways .
either of it will be a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s it in about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is something like this .
so , is that , then , we &apos;re here right now right now right now .
we &apos;re here in this line , in a transition from the world &apos;s world , in a transition from the world &apos;s world .
so the question that i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state of the world &apos;s slowly , the world &apos;s slowly .
because the transition is very , very confusing , is very confusing to be very confusing if you &apos;re in the inside .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what &apos;s going to happen in the year 2000 .
now , we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re going to go on than that .
so in other words , the future is a year since i &apos;ve been in this world since i &apos;m on the world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there is something that &apos;s going to be .
the transition is going to happen . we can all it .
and we know that there &apos;s no meaning to try to do , or 50 years into the future , because everything is so different that is a simple <unk> of what we do now , simply not make sense .
i want to talk about what this could be , this transition in which we &apos;re currently in the right now .
so to make this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really nothing with technology or computers .
because i think that really , i think about this , we need to go back and go to the point and look at the point of a time .
and i want to look at this on the earth &apos;s life , right now .
i think the big picture makes sense , if you &apos;re <unk> it into a few <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is a billion billion years , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with a lot of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized like these chemicals , then we have a pretty good picture about how they <unk> the <unk> .
i think there &apos;s theories that i started to understand how all these things have been rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a bit of what is that time of little <unk> <unk> , which are different kinds of chemicals for chemicals .
some of these strands contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and so grow .
all the way that were , started to the <unk> .
these little <unk> were in the sense of the <unk> <unk> .
but this is not about life in the way , because every single one was just a little , a little , <unk> <unk> <unk> of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they have <unk> chemicals in the midst of many times .
so every one woman was slightly different .
in fact , the <unk> that had a <unk> for growth <unk> faster than others and integrated more and more and more chemicals from the outside and shared .
so these are so much more to survive , and they &apos;re acting in <unk> .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these <unk> <unk> is a trick over an abstraction .
in some ways , we don &apos;t fully understand fully understanding , have this <unk> capacity to do information .
they &apos;ve learned that the recipe for the cell as information is to store as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have in this <unk> , evolutionary species , which allowed them to be , what they were allowed to be <unk> , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this sort of information is that this sort of information is to store over the time of a billion billion years ago , and they were in the same time .
in fact , the recipe for us , is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same .
and that every creatures are used exactly the same letters and the same thing .
we &apos;re at that point that we just can do the <unk> , and we can write the thing in this code .
and i have a hundred <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m in airports in airports , in airports , i &apos;m trying to try to hold out in airports .
it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i have this one , i have this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it &apos;s a 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants to take a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was a <unk> reality , i would have it to be a virus and in the space .
so what &apos;s next to step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , very interesting , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s starting to communicate these cells and information that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the shifting antibiotics is growing antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how they were able to stay away from penicillin and have these information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are <unk> on penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication allowed allowed to the very many of communities that were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either have either survived together , or they went together under the one . that meant that if a community had been successful , all individuals who are more frequently and repeatedly , by evolution .
so the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to the community of the whole community , they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a <unk> basis .
and the next stage stage took about another billion years .
at that point , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which together is in the field of a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not going to be asked for themselves .
your skin cells are <unk> without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , and so on .
so these communities started to <unk> , so that the plane that evolution was happening on which evolution was happening , but the whole <unk> thing that we call .
so the next step is now within these communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that can &apos;t do anything else , as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that these <unk> have built these <unk> .
they started specialists in specialists within the community , special structures that are responsible for learning , understanding and the information of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
and this gave you an evolutionary benefit .
because at that point an individual -- learning a single person within the time of the lifetime of one organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so an organism could not eat , for example , not to eat a certain fruit because they were bad and sick , the last time he ate her .
this could happen in the lifetime of one of these individual organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were needed because of this information , of <unk> , of the individuals , which died of the fruit , which had not yet yet yet there .
the nervous system has been the <unk> in this particular <unk> because evolution could have now within a significant place .
she could take place within a time .
what happened after that , that the individual organisms are going to find a way to communicate with each other .
once , as an example , the <unk> of us is familiar with the human version of this <unk> is human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically <unk> notes from me to create a similar <unk> idea in your head that &apos;s a very confusing to create an idea that has a certain with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns it into sounds , a sequence of sound , and creating something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a really important organism .
and what we actually did is we think of humanity , is we started to abstract human .
we &apos;re going through the same stages of the stages of <unk> through which <unk> through our methods -- the abstraction of our methods , how we can make data .
the invention of the language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , computer , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on these are all our <unk> mechanisms that we built in our community to deal with this information .
and it connects to all together , to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we were so far .
so nowadays evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a <unk> little <unk> where he saw a little evolution in &quot; <unk> &quot; program , right in front of your eyes .
so we have the <unk> again again .
the first step of story i told you , <unk> a billion years a billion years .
the next steps , how the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like speech , and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and this next steps , like electronics , seem to seem few decades .
so the process of the process is feeding itself , i think , <unk> is the word -- if something is its <unk> .
the more it changes the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process of itself .
i live in a living in a way of computers and i know that i could use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not without the recent advances in the computer .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity of design that it &apos;s impossible to be in the traditional sense of design .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is in the <unk> of the <unk> .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
what i do instead of doing instead , which is also the designer of thinking , is , we think of a certain <unk> , <unk> that machine and the machine does something that we extend our ability to extend far better .
and it &apos;s partly about the way we don &apos;t even understand right now .
so , a way which is particularly interesting , and what i often have is used recently , is evolution itself .
we put a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
so to give an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that &apos;s made out of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , please , 100 million randomly selected sequences of the instructions .
now , please run this randomly chosen chosen to take all the programs , and pick up all the programs that are mine in the next . &quot;
so in other words , i think i &apos;m going to do what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to sort of a number of example , this would be a simple example of what i used to do .
so , these are programs that most of the most likely you can move numbers .
of course , the chance of random chosen is the chance you &apos;re expecting to be a chance of random numbers , so i won &apos;t actually make the fact that we won &apos;t actually make the really the fact that .
but one of those things like two are two numbers in the right order of back to the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that are my <unk> .
they store that off , <unk> the rest .
now , all of these <unk> that are the numbers of the best in the best .
and that &apos;s a kind of technique that &apos;s called <unk> . &quot;
take two programs and they create children through the exchange of the <unk> , and the kids are <unk> the properties of the <unk> of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that are developed by creating combinations of programs that are slightly closer to the <unk> than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them again .
and there might be some mutations .
and try and try and another generation .
all these generations need to be very few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases for a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can perfect the numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever heard of hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how to work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s arrogant , i &apos;m weird programs .
but they do work .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that come in the job .
because they &apos;re on the same time , if they did the job .
i sat in a 747 with marvin <unk> , <unk> , he <unk> a map of <unk> and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , &quot; this plane is made of <unk> <unk> , which is working together in order to make their flight secure , don &apos;t do it ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not an optimal optimal , if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we start to leave the computer , for a process , which is very creative technology .
it allows us to be a much more powerful complexity than it would allow us to produce a much more powerful complexity than it would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it .
so <unk> <unk> technology is so technology .
so we use these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we &apos;re able to do these things that processes can do that faster .
so it &apos;s a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be as confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding by themselves .
we &apos;re going to raise .
we &apos;re at a point of view , the analog is to be as a <unk> evolved .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t really see what the hell we &apos;re doing is actually creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think that after something else comes out .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> to tell us that we are evolution in evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of the creation of whatever comes out of whatever &apos;s next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here now before i &apos;m going to be <unk> .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert sky , <unk> <unk> .
we talked about it that has nothing changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel back to the time , we went into a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
at the time , as the great indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took a arch , took a shot , took off the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic of machines replaced the machines .
that was really sad .
i got a little scared of technology .
i was scared that i could lose the ability to make the <unk> , the <unk> , without giving orders to my friends .
i found that technology can make magic possible , and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this is a piece of 50 years old technology that &apos;s got the <unk> thing for me .
she was being a <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and i have to get pictures in my imagination .
i think it &apos;s so before we thought about our email and cameras from them to dream about it .
they kept at us to be inspired by being inspired .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use them to help magic rather than kill instead .
i started 16 books started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling that &apos;s a thing to the storytelling , the readers can connect to the world .
it can know how we think it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
and the storytelling is always needed more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> an interactive ipad .
here &apos;s : &quot; put your fingers on each light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s : &quot; this box is &quot; i write my name .
and i think it &apos;s going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad is white where i live -- i live -- i &apos;m <unk> .
the kid in me is really excited about this .
i have a lot of magic .
i mean , i &apos;m not a magician and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i always found is quite exciting .
so you have to blow the ipad out of the ipad and the fireflies <unk> .
and the <unk> is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy in one galaxy can be in a single <unk> .
and so here &apos;s every book , and every world of a little <unk> that i &apos;m here to be , you know , to the magic device in the device .
and this is a map .
<unk> had always been maps , but these were the maps of static .
this map grows and air and it &apos;s a <unk> to see the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also about the book of the book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
it &apos;s important to make something important , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> <unk> .
we all heard about <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india are familiar with their english colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> in <unk> trapped in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history for children .
a story that connects to the new issues , like the <unk> <unk> .
the theme of the last 10 years is a big problem for the last 10 years , kids in their <unk> , on their <unk> , on their computers , without a basketball .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search for you . you need to go out and see the camera &apos;s pictures of the very soft images .
as a kid , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
somehow , the children are not making .
this is <unk> <unk> . you need to go out to a chapter to make a photograph of a photograph from a flower and to tag a photograph .
in another chapter you have to get a piece of <unk> and tag .
so you actually actually make a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey , i saw a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photographs that actually took it .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of magic to combine the world and technology together .
so the next book we &apos;re planning is a interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads and the <unk> reality of the ipads and <unk> of the animation that appear on a plant .
at a point , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , and you can read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of the technology comes into technology and the forces of technology and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , and the magic , and the love of our childhood was simple , the simple medium of history .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons , or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest and the world &apos;s most of the most common , and in places that there &apos;s a lot of brazilians .
here at ted , to see , as a matter , to see how stark this , i &apos;ve been very much force .
in short , i &apos;ve got a sense of : ted has an identity .
you can tell things that the world &apos;s influence .
and sometimes when something comes to ted , it gets a meaning and strength that it would not have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that words of a teacher &apos;s words , but the words of a dedicated teacher are meaningful .
as a physician can do good , you can do good . as a <unk> doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother &apos;s .
i was being big in a family , a traditional household household , who was dominated by a <unk> dominated , and that was the <unk> my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had a lot .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the origin of many disputes in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia than slaves were born .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped the way very strong .
my grandmother was a lot , but she was loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up with me and <unk> .
she was able to tell me that i could barely breathe , and then they let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel still my embrace ? &quot;
and if i say , &quot; no &quot; said she <unk> me . if i said , &quot; yes , let me go in quiet .
she was something that was made you always be in her to be around .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend a time with her , it was hard to get attention .
my cousins fell around all around .
i remember , i must have eight or nine , i was that i woke up in the morning and into the living room . all my cousins fell around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the <unk> and <unk> .
first , i thought that would be a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she was on and she came up and came over and came over and she said , &quot; come , <unk> . you need to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me out with outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you need to promise you that you &apos;re not going to be <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised to grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; aye . &quot;
she sat me up , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you gotta give me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , as a first time , you know , you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise you to your promise you &apos;re going to take care . &quot;
i &apos;m my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , i said , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next time i &apos;m telling you that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; yes , i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to be promise is , &quot; you never alcohol alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , i promise . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural , rural , i have a brother who &apos;s older and a half younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother went home and brought his brother home , my sister and me went to the forest .
we just <unk> it as well as it anyway .
and then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s a nurse , and she took them , and then offered them to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . right . just ok . i don &apos;t want to beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do we now do that . we do that all the things we do .
i had what she was , your sister had a beer . go on , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just just . it &apos;s just just . &quot;
my brother was looking at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at my face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t do it yet for you , just crazy for the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells all the children that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i shouldn &apos;t do it .
this is maybe the <unk> transfer of the center .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i <unk> that i never had a drinks , alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that , because i think it &apos;s a <unk> . i &apos;m saying that &apos;s because identity is power .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people to tell us things that they don &apos;t think of first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in the prison prison prison .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these are the issues that we need to take care .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in <unk> and in prison .
today , there &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states have the highest world &apos;s world &apos;s highest <unk> .
seven million people are <unk> on the <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
i think we have a fundamentally altered changing our world &apos;s fundamental .
in socially weak and black parts of the population of the population , are masters despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black are between 18 and 30 in prison prison , in prison , on the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities , in los angeles , from los angeles over philadelphia , in philadelphia , in 2008 , in 2008 , are 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men in prison in prison , in prison , or <unk> .
our system is not just being driven by questions that with <unk> , it &apos;s also being done by poverty .
we have a <unk> country that makes them much better when they are rich and they &apos;re guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , affected the outcome .
but still we seem to be satisfied with this .
a politics of fear and anger has been convinced that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the face .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some of these kinds of <unk> developments .
my home is <unk> , <unk> them , if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male population is lost their <unk> population , and they lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that 10 years of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , which is <unk> children to death in prison .
in this country , there are children <unk> <unk> <unk> without any of these things .
we have a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of the death penalty is an interesting question .
we believe , because you &apos;ve been taught that the real question is : has a man deserves a man , for a <unk> crimes of crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about how we see our identity .
the other way is not : anybody in a crime deserves , but it &apos;s : we have to make it , kill for a crime ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty is defined by defined by error .
so on nine people we &apos;ve been executed , we get one that we &apos;ve been executed for innocent , who was released and made off of death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of us innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly somebody with an airplane fly , if for nine planes , the <unk> , one .
but somehow we can do it , we &apos;re <unk> by this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , if we &apos;re not quite killing that .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m telling my students , african history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , which is the time for the end of the <unk> , the beginning of the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the men in this country , there was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be scared of <unk> .
or before bombs .
it was the terror terror that was living in front of us .
these elders people come up with me and say , &quot; mr mr <unk> , you &apos;re talking to the people , you &apos;re telling people that they &apos;re supposed to stop saying that we should stop in the history of our nation with terrorism . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> motivated to surrender and apartheid .
and yet there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t talk to about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what &apos;s happening in the historical context of the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly putting together .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s about to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to get us to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> cannot overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , it was the willingness to do these willingness , but not in that our country .
i &apos;ve been in a couple of talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear you . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death .
and of course , it can never give them more . &quot;
it was very quiet . then she said a woman with our history , that we &apos;ve ever been impossible to do that again for the people who are going to take people to do this again .
it would be <unk> of us , and we &apos;re aware of it , and it &apos;s not people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would be like to live in a world where the german state of people were <unk> , especially if there were a lot of jewish being in many jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we are people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , 11 times higher , if the victim knows black is , when the victim knows black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , the body <unk> people .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is being driven .
if we don &apos;t deal with this hard topics , the positive issues , and the positive things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> of suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;m important to clubs .
because we talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication to be more dedication to be able to make in a complex world .
for me , this is how to work , thinking about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> that will never be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own life .
we all need to believe in the end of the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so , we &apos;re rational , so we &apos;re so much .
innovation , creativity , and development , not just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s the <unk> that i think it &apos;s going to push us , not just open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once i said .
&quot; when we fought in europe , we wanted to do everything , but what we wanted to do most of , was , an intellectual guidance , the willingness to be , in some spiritual , an intellectual guidance , the willingness to be in places and witness . &quot;
this is an intellectual orientation that &apos;s the core of what i think is that the <unk> will be involved .
there &apos;s no way to do technology and design that allows us to be in the way that we don &apos;t even have eyes and ears have ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is much more of us , when we didn &apos;t care about it .
she gets deeply touch .
as a young lawyer , i was <unk> the great privilege to meet the <unk> parks .
mrs. parks once came back to the <unk> , where they were two of their elders , <unk> these elders , <unk> <unk> , who had been initiated the <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , white king <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk>
so these women were going to come and just just <unk> .
and then i called a woman and i dialed a woman at me and said , &quot; <unk> , &quot; mrs. parks is coming in the city . we want to talk about .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m listening . &quot;
and i went over and just just too .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i sat there and i heard these women and after a few hours turned up to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me what the &quot; initiative &quot; is right .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
<unk> people want to help us , who were convicted of innocent .
we want to bias bias and discrimination in the <unk> fight .
we want to <unk> <unk> without any of us to abolish abolish a lot of children .
we want to do something against the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , woman <unk> <unk> <unk> , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you must be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and so i think that the ted ted should be <unk> .
we need to make it to the <unk> of us , these problems , that suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity , our humanity , is the rest of our humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of simple things .
we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone doesn &apos;t take something that he &apos;s not heard , is it just a <unk> .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s so , there is a basic human dignity that &apos;s the law .
i think that in many parts of this country , and in many parts of this country , the opposite of poverty , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that there are too many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring , and so , we don &apos;t know about our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing .
ultimately , a society is not measured how they do their rich and powerful and powerful and the british and the <unk> , but how they deal with the poor , the convicted of the clinic , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in that context , we start to understand the amazing things that we &apos;re going to do with .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . i sometimes lose the balance .
sometimes i urge you to do .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas , we can think of our thinking ahead , in very important ways .
i <unk> these children who were very hard for <unk> .
i go to <unk> and visit a client who &apos;s got to be 13 or 14 years old , and the one as an adult court is supposed to be to be .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can someone turn somebody into something that he &apos;s not about ?
the judge looks like him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long and thought , my god , if a judge can turn into something different , then he must have <unk> .
well , the judge , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish you what would be .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think more really , i started to work .
i had a <unk> , poor black boy than a client .
and i started to say that the headline was , &quot; careful , my poor , <unk> black , like a privileged , <unk> black inmates like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in my judgment , i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and police and <unk> are <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that country in this country &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there &apos;s just an <unk> .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was that crazy judgment just dreamed or actually wrote it .
and i didn &apos;t just wrote it to my horror , but also sent him to court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
and finally , i decided , my god , i must put in the court and this crazy case .
i went to the car and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that it &apos;s going to be so hard to painful .
and after all , i went out of my car , and the stairs went up to the court .
when i was the staircase for the trial , there was a elderly , black man , who &apos;s black man who was the needy in court .
when he saw me , he came to me over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
he came to me and i was <unk> .
then he put me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to her . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it was something that really touched something deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge showed me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have this crazy <unk> effect ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people come in , just because they were angry .
i was written that crazy stuff .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office office and office office and office office .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of people who had been angry , we talked about skin color , talking about poverty , about inequality .
and i saw the <unk> <unk> i saw the nurse and go off .
he looked back through the window and i could hear the whole <unk> .
he went down and down .
after all , this older black man came with a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat straight behind me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge was a pause .
during the break , a <unk> in the <unk> , which was he was upset that the job was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and then he looked at the <unk> , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man . don &apos;t give you the goal . don &apos;t give you a <unk> .
i &apos;ve got to ted , because i think many of you have been understood that the moral monkey &apos;s moral <unk> , but it &apos;s the justice of the justice system .
we &apos;re not entirely designed as humans , unless we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that &apos;s where we survive our survival with each one &apos;s time .
we &apos;re our visions of technology and design , and of entertainment and creativity , to compassion and justice .
and i want to all of you that just see this as well , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give you . don &apos;t give you .
you have this audience , this community , this community , and it &apos;s heard of you , and you &apos;ve heard something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , where it &apos;s about to do , actually , a effort to do something , something from the <unk> , which is the politics of politics .
here , california , for example , is to a billion dollars for the <unk> <unk> a billion dollars for the death penalty is a billion dollars .
and yet , <unk> percent of all the <unk> &apos;s not with a <unk> .
56 percent of all the <unk> are not supposed to court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this is a <unk> that makes money in more and security for the money in more and security .
i think there are ways there .
over the last three decades , the <unk> has been huge in america &apos;s immense .
this is a fact that often put into a relationship with the elevated <unk> .
what would you say someone who believes ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> is not very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really know at the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come high in the prisoner .
we have <unk> , the rhetoric of the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , which people used to get behind the grid , for a <unk> , for the theft of good , rather than you get it to the <unk> of the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who are not trained victims , the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you have a string of the <unk> .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is a <unk> <unk> with himself .
two : famine . three : famine . o.c. spray of police .
four : malignant <unk> . a few of them are dangerous : dangerous <unk> .
in fact , six degrees of social decline , in 7 : 65 dead .
<unk> : <unk> .
different speakers : <unk> . mass destruction .
recession . <unk> . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips that i collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media is prefer to show us to the negative issues , because our minds are precisely these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second day , our senses , our senses , more information than our brain can ever process much more information .
and because of us , because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first time for all the information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> , our <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> all the information for the <unk> of any <unk> of risk in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , is very true .
well , with all our digital devices that takes seven days , 24 hours a day , all these negative news , is it &apos;s not miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s still bad .
but it &apos;s probably not the case .
it &apos;s potentially , it &apos;s really .
maybe the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century that we &apos;ve been made in the last century through a series of forces , so that it &apos;s going to be able to create the next three decades of creating a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we have a big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at all of problems , problems in very long term , but they &apos;re going to get a <unk> .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can make the progress .
over the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled the average lifespan of the population &apos;s <unk> has tripled .
child mortality has a tenth of a tenth .
and then , that &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
steve , showed us that we &apos;re currently in a very peaceful time of life living in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> is going down over the last 130 years of 25 percent at 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we extend our expectations on the time .
in fact , we have poverty .
remember a lot of americans that live under the poverty of poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , <unk> , mobile , <unk> and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of earth could never be able to dream of these kinds of music .
the foundation for many of these things are creating technologies , and they &apos;re growing <unk> .
my friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to use that to the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> doubling doubling doubling all 12 to the last time .
so , the <unk> is about the phone in your pocket , about a million times less and more than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how do you get out -- in good like in the bad times , war or peace , recession and <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s the result of the faster computers that make the faster computers .
it &apos;s slow for none of our big problems .
and also , despite their <unk> , the left is running up .
so the rate itself is accelerating .
and on this graph , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of remarkable technologies that are available to all the available .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that &apos;s my friends in autodesk , <unk> sensors and networks , robots , robots , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , digital medicine , <unk> biology , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> supercomputer , &quot; jeopardy , &quot; you know ?
that was a big .
i &apos;ve got the newspaper <unk> , and after the best headlines , i could find that .
i love this : &quot; watson of human adversaries . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy . &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about to understand the other in the language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would have every owner of a <unk> available to each owner .
four years ago ray kurzweil and i &apos;m here at ted , at ted , singularity , &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies , with focused on how this used to be used to tackle the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services within a decade that can live in a decade of people &apos;s life .
think about this , that can be the group of students today , from billions of students today .
30 years ago , this is ridiculous .
today we can have made that dozens of companies that have made that happen .
if i think that &apos;s abundance , i mean , that i don &apos;t have a life of luxury for everyone on this planet , and it &apos;s about to me , a living in a way of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making a <unk> goods abundance abundance .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource of <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 1700s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he has invited the king of <unk> dinner dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> <unk> , <unk> himself .
the king of <unk> was given <unk> .
aluminum was at this time , the most valuable metal on the planet , more than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> made of aluminum was made .
although aluminum <unk> is <unk> percent of the <unk> &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s not as a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be through oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of the design industry is developed and made of a cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet with more <unk> more energy than we use every year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all the <unk> in minutes all the time .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , it &apos;s made for the first time , the cost of solar power to 50 percent of the <unk> to reduce the <unk> , <unk> rupees , for 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy is the last year by 50 percent .
last month , this was a study that shows that up to the end of this decade in the sunny areas of u.s. solar fuel , at the end of the u.s. , solar dollars per gallon , compared to 15 cents on the national average cost .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll have water in the surplus of abundance of water .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the average minister of 1990 , when it was <unk> on saturn , it was back to the earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet , which is 70 percent of the water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent of the grain , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting by the <unk> percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there &apos;s new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation with dean &apos;s <unk> , one of the innovators of doing it , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you -- and he gave me permission to -- and his <unk> , the size of a <unk> in <unk> .
it can produce a thousand liters of clean water drinking water a day from different sources -- whether it &apos;s grain , polluted water , latrine , and all that for less than two cents a gallon .
the chairman of the coca-cola has just <unk> , a large <unk> of a hundred units in the developing world .
and when everything is good , and i &apos;m very confident , then , is very confident , then coca-cola is the technology globally in <unk> countries around the planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there are today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you know , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent of mobile phones from mobile in the world to end in the world of 2013 .
just consider a <unk> with a cell phone in the middle of kenya in kenya , a better <unk> than president <unk> 25 years ago .
and if you look at your phone , you have to look at more access and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that information and communication has been in the surplus of abundance , no one ever could predict .
and it &apos;s getting better , things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph photograph , libraries and photograph , libraries of books and music , and technology , technology is now literally <unk> and cheaper in her cell phone .
and the best thing about this is potentially , what &apos;s going on in the field .
last month , i had the pleasure , with the <unk> of the <unk> that so-called $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize .
we &apos;re asking teams to connect the world to each other in a computer and so connect to each other in a computer cell , because it &apos;s called an ai equipped , you can test your <unk> or your <unk> <unk> .
and to win the device a better diagnosis , as a team of physicians physicians .
imagine this device . right in a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> , who &apos;s not known , &quot; he calls the center for the center , and it &apos;s not a pandemic before it .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are on population .
we &apos;ve just got the <unk> .
and just by the way , the biggest <unk> is an explosion of a better upbringing and food in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people in online , they &apos;re connected to each other .
by 2020 , we &apos;re <unk> by two billion <unk> <unk> .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , are the global communication of us .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to do ?
and instead of a global flu , i see one of the greatest economic history of history .
these people represent several hundred trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the healthier healthier , and they &apos;re going to be able to have a better through the <unk> , and by doing so much more productive than ever before .
so what can we grow up three billion growing healthy , healthy , educated , productive members of the <unk> ?
so , as if it was a sentence , i never heard about <unk> .
so what if it was to , the oppressed , wherever you &apos;re giving up to the oppressed , to make a voice to make sense and change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how would it be with <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that little teams that are passionately interested in the passion of passion and focus , extraordinary things , extraordinary things , and government governments could create extraordinary things .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you may know .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it was developed at university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game that &apos;s a person in the individuals , to explore a sequence of amino acids , to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
the first thing we can predict is we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by professors and so .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that nowadays the human pattern are better proteins that are the proteins that are <unk> .
and as these individuals came and looked at who &apos;s best in the world &apos;s most <unk> of the world , this was not a <unk> , manchester , manchester , a woman who was a assistant who worked as assistant at night and the best <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s going to be so far in our future , is the fact that we have more than individuals to do that planet &apos;s big challenges .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to the new challenges , and to do that , to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some remarkable decades .
thank you .
i think we need something to a <unk> piece of medical culture companies need to be .
and i think it &apos;s starting with a medical medical and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough business , when i could allow it to give me a piece of my own fake <unk> , to give up this piece of my own fake <unk> .
but before i come to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s make a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> and move forward to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems to be a moment and turns to the statistics and to make this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to refer to a certain statistic i hope that most of you have heard of it .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a loan loan .
that means that the number of three three beats is beating up three of us .
this is called the ball of the <unk> , it &apos;s going to come up , it won &apos;t be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball on the first base , didn &apos;t get it in time and the star was safe .
three of 10 .
you know , you know , you &apos;re like a <unk> in <unk> <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
you know , what you call a <unk> ?
this is somebody &apos;s going to be a lot of four to the rest of it .
<unk> -- like ted williams -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player &apos;s <unk> on the last <unk> baseball player &apos;s time ago by 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over 400 times over
let &apos;s go back to my own world &apos;s medicine , which i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little bit less likely to talk about it .
so if you took a <unk> and you &apos;re going to a <unk> , whose <unk> 400 is 400 in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine they live in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved <unk> people with <unk> and her <unk> <unk> of these <unk> , whose <unk> <unk> of <unk> is 200 in <unk> in 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
and they &apos;re beating a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> should be a <unk> .
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one &apos;s in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or should be <unk> or <unk> .
but what we do is we that we &apos;re able to be able to see , including me to be able to go to the world &apos;s being perfect .
never make a mistake , no one but the details thought about the details of how this should be supposed .
and that &apos;s the message i &apos;ve been in medical school medical school .
i was a <unk> student .
in high school , a school student said that brian <unk> was a <unk> learning for a <unk> .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the sisters of general hospital at toronto , <unk> of the one .
i learned everything .
in my favorite school , i learned the origins and the tail every <unk> , every branch of every artery that is <unk> by every artery that <unk> <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i knew even the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed off with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew everything that knew and everything as much as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as possible as possible as possible .
and it worked for a while i met my wife printer .
i <unk> on a <unk> in toronto , a woman &apos;s in toronto , as a woman printer to me in the clinic hospital .
at that time i was the <unk> <unk> , i was <unk> <unk> .
and it was my assignment as the <unk> <unk> advice to study the <unk> of advice .
and feedback to my <unk> .
i was a proud of my wife , and she was in <unk> .
and when i was to her , she made sound <unk> .
and when i was able to hear their chest with the <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on the two sides that she told me that she was under <unk> heart failure .
that &apos;s a state in which the heart is failing , rather than losing the whole blood going on , and then filling out a part of the blood in the lungs , and then they filling this together , therefore , the <unk> .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i made them , and i made me .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure off the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> water , water pills , so they &apos;re the liquid <unk> .
and over a time , a year and a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without speaking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on the on and i did what was a call in my <unk> , he would have to be what a call in my <unk> would have a chance to make a very picture .
and he knew her would be able to get rid of the shoes of the time .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed and so much as being able to do responsibility , i would have so , and so i would not have to worry about my patients without him .
my second mistake was worse .
and i made her home , i <unk> them , i <unk> a little voice in my hands that i was trying to say , &quot; the <unk> , not a good idea . do it . &quot;
and in fact , it was so much of my <unk> that i asked the nurse , which was about woman &apos;s printer , &quot; believe it &apos;s okay , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , in <unk> , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember that as it was yesterday .
so i went <unk> and an <unk> and <unk> and <unk> her and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i was working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and then i grabbed my stuff , getting the hospital and went to the car to drive home to the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went through the <unk> <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister &apos;s sister , but another three words are scared to me and those three words are scared most of the most <unk> that i know .
other doctors fear these same as , but the <unk> is particularly because we &apos;re just going to see the patient &apos;s just like the patient .
three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that you were at home ? &quot;
asked the nurse &apos;s <unk> .
so , &quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after she arrived after i sent her home after i sent her home , collapsed and the family called 911 . the <unk> brought back to the <unk> with a blood pressure by 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous thing .
they were barely eating , and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them up to the <unk> .
i was shocked to go inside the inner <unk> .
and i was going through these rollercoaster , because they were <unk> for the <unk> to come in the <unk> and i hoped that they would recover .
and after two , three days , three days , i realized that she never had .
she had no <unk> <unk> .
her family had gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they were <unk> .
the <unk> day they <unk> them -- woman printer , a woman and grandmother , grandmother .
you say you don &apos;t forget the names of those who never forget the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned that .
the next weeks i made , and i had to quit the first time the <unk> shame that was there -- i felt isolated , <unk> , not the kind of healthy shame you have in our medical culture -- i felt isolated , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you know all the healthy shame , if you &apos;re a secret of the best friend , although this one is <unk> , and you get caught and get a <unk> and the best friend of a deal , and my best friend , if you take a bad conscience , my own discussion is going to be .
if you do <unk> , and you never make the mistakes again and the error .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the <unk> kind of talk about that , is the one in the heart .
it &apos;s the one who says that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but you &apos;re not bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my <unk> , he was very gentle .
he talked about the family , and i &apos;m sure he was <unk> , and sure he was <unk> , and sure i would not sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why am i <unk> home ?
and then i think , in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i going to go into medicine ?
slowly , but it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better .
and then a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i was broke myself , maybe i can feel better .
and i was struck with me that if i was going to cover my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake that could the voice <unk> .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service in <unk> in a <unk> hospital north toronto north toronto , and i <unk> a <unk> man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of us and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he showed up here .
i looked at the <unk> and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> and my next <unk> and my <unk> asked me to her office .
and she said the three words : you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turned out to a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not infection in the <unk> , but the top of the <unk> is the <unk> .
and luckily , he died .
he got <unk> <unk> and <unk> himself a few days later .
and i went back to the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , and <unk> and went to <unk> and went to the work until it again and again and again , and again , again .
in a <unk> , i have a <unk> overlooked overlooked .
there &apos;s a lot of them to do , especially if you think you &apos;re in a hospital that &apos;s working at that time , that &apos;s at the time that &apos;s only 14 patients at night .
in both cases , i sent them home , and there were no <unk> in their treatment .
i thought he would have <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys of the kidneys , and when the <unk> was <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient &apos;s <unk> is a <unk> in the bottom right and called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him and asked to my colleagues to actually show my colleagues .
and he did the thing and he was a <unk> in the right lower sector , called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was good for them .
both of them <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only in the first five years of what many of my colleagues say , but is total nonsense .
some of my favorite <unk> happened in the last five years .
and it alone , and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t talk to my own mistakes and you can talk about them , if i agree the little voice that tells me what &apos;s really happening is , how can i share with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my own mistakes , so they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i was a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when you heard the last time you heard about somebody heard about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh yeah , they &apos;re going to go to a cocktail party and you like you like any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to talk somebody about the sounds of your own mistakes .
if i had a room full of colleagues and to ask their immediate help and start to ask them to tell you what i was just told you , i would achieve it , i would probably reach the end of the second story , before it would be uncomfortable and the rest .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues that had a <unk> in my hospital hospital someone would have bought the wrong leg , then she would believe me , i would have trouble .
that &apos;s the system where we live .
it &apos;s an absolute denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do , those who are not doing the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> , which are the bad results and the <unk> that are with good results .
it &apos;s almost a <unk> response to such an antibodies response to a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re those who make the mistakes from medicine , that &apos;s a secure system .
but there are two problems that are happening .
in my about 20 years of the medical field and journalism journalism , i &apos;ve been doing a personal medical study about medical mistakes and medicine for so much for me to my first article for one of my first article that i wrote for the toronto star .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day in which one is either in the one day , in which one of the <unk> is either a fake or <unk> <unk> is a fake <unk> , and always more and <unk> .
in this country , at least 24,000 canadians are errors in <unk> errors .
in the united states , the institute has been the institute for medicine , in 100,000 .
both of these are strong <unk> because we don &apos;t think the problem as we should .
and is the <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> in the medical knowledge , two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with the <unk> .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own a cognitive error , so that we own a perfect error for a patient with chest chest chest with chest chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , <unk> it and <unk> and give a breath , breath and a suddenly <unk> history of all the story .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all these are in errors are inevitable .
so if you take the system like i was taught , and all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , then at the end of the system .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white <unk> , black art , &quot; i &apos;ve got to make the habit , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would have to anyone from the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> saying , &quot; this is my worst , &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you with the microphone .
and then you get your pupils , they &apos;re pushed off , and they &apos;ve got caught and eat , and start to tell you , and start to tell you their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you &apos;re doing in this position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physician .
the newly defined physician is a man , knowing his humanity , she &apos;s accepted , is not proud of doing it , but it &apos;s all about something from you to learn to it .
they share their experience with others .
they supported them to others from their mistakes .
and she shows other people whose mistakes are not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , <unk> way all of it .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes people the system with life , and if that &apos;s so , you know , people are too <unk> at time .
so that the system can evolve to make sense of what makes it easier to make sense of people who are inevitably inevitably , and it also enabled to create loving spaces that could make the health mistakes and the <unk> of that , even things that &apos;s being rewarded for people .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the newly defined doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best possible to learn from it to other other people .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding to me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can tell this idea in one minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was <unk> here .
you may think that he &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as a &quot; common . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
until the &apos; 80s , he was turned into great style , he was very great .
now , it stands on the red list as a red list .
this story is a lot of times of the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
still , we still get onto the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally originally .
the <unk> describe it still as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to think about another concept , the <unk> <unk> , is inspiring .
because i &apos;ve seen it as i fell in love in a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate me .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i persuaded that i really wasn &apos;t going to be there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you see , the lagoon was <unk> and <unk> by a few of these mangroves .
there was <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these were very <unk> and the fishermen were good at it and making it work well , and it was good in ghana .
when i 27 years later , the fish was growing in half its size .
they cut five inches of them .
they were genetically <unk> .
it still was fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also was lucky to be there .
so it &apos;s nothing changed , and yet it &apos;s all changed .
my third little story is about my <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather , the 1960s , <unk> europe of many <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which was a hundred fish , the industrial fishing fishing fish that pretty much ugly ship is <unk> .
i went to the southern and we did , we took the harbor <unk> of the southern sea and particularly in the <unk> .
we had no words for what we started .
i know it &apos;s the reason that the sea was .
90 percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots are in the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
essentially , the bottom came in the sea , and then then became <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re a survey of a uprising , and then then the commercial fishing fishing .
the reason it &apos;s changed . it &apos;s in this case -- a hard reason or a soft corals will undermine <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , you throw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
they wanted to kill them because they could eat them .
in fact , this mountain is actually going to absorb all of the fishermen &apos;s battery , if you go into areas where you &apos;re never been there in the areas that has never been there .
it &apos;s not documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re going to fit our <unk> to the new level , and we don &apos;t call it into a reminder of what there was .
if you &apos;re going to <unk> , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , green their country , the <unk> .
and over time it &apos;s changing . it changes because for people are quite natural .
every generation look at the images that they &apos;re at the beginning of their own life , as standard and everything .
the difference is as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a sense of changes .
and at the end , they want to be the most peaceful remains .
that &apos;s now , largely , our goal now .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not like they &apos;re .
now , you could think that the problem of people who are sure is that when you were in <unk> societies , animals , and that would kill people , and they were killing people to be aware of what they did .
because obviously , an animal that &apos;s very often , which is very often , only before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not as much as a big loss .
and over time we focus on the big animals and the sea , the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be less rare because we &apos;re going to catch them .
and with the time , little fish left and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people are willing to accept that .
well , because she doesn &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are scientists , scientists , tell that it was really different .
you &apos;ll tell it because the evidence , as they &apos;re in a previous form of these early forms , they &apos;re not like that , would like to make the evidence like the evidence .
there &apos;s an example of the one that &apos;s report that the report of a <unk> <unk> , which is not used in this area , or not , by <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that the people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past , the sources of the past .
it shows the vast big role that can play a <unk> .
because by <unk> , we &apos;re basically the past .
we &apos;re going to put the past again that people can &apos;t understand because they have the <unk> changes and very low .
so that people can see the <unk> , the <unk> and the way that we can benefit from the window that it allows to have your <unk> .
what is the people who are not possible that this is because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
and here , i think the art and the film might be the gap and simulation of the film , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a <unk> <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , you might remember the avatar .
if you think of &quot; avatar &quot; if you think the people were so touched by this , why people were so touched by the <unk> , why were the way that they were so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that has lost lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give up to the cameron of cameron is to be called &quot; avatar . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist , the communist <unk> , when you had a typewriter , it was in the government .
they had to be a leaf with a <unk> from this <unk> .
the reason for this is that the government could find them , where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how someone could do something like this , and how much would be the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you print a new year , 2011 , a new <unk> of the leading <unk> buy and a page of print , that side has this light yellow <unk> on every side of the <unk> and your printer that the <unk> will make the site .
this is happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments technology against us , against us , citizens .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the existing existing <unk> of the existing existing .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can control the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in ukraine .
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who you have to have done through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on .
these people are made online , but they have illegal them , by using <unk> , to the <unk> of <unk> , while we &apos;re used to do our <unk> , or also <unk> that our <unk> could have collected the keyboard over the keyboard .
the u.s. intelligence was <unk> two months ago , the swiss bank account by mr. <unk> , who was one , and on the account of the bank , <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on his foot , the <unk> is not unknown .
and i claim that it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be victims of a <unk> , as a kind of a <unk> in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to be worse .
in the future , most of the crime are <unk> online .
the second largest <unk> we can see today are not getting through cash .
they &apos;re <unk> by something else -- the <unk> , or through her audience .
groups like medicaid are over the last 12 months , and they &apos;re at one of the <unk> on the field of the <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals who are criminals for the money , <unk> such as anonymous , but the last group of the nations , governments , the attacks of the attacks , governments , the attacks .
there are cases of the cases of <unk> .
it shows a great thing that happens when governments are attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or , in the netherlands , or it was .
last fall , it had to sign up the <unk> , because <unk> was hacked .
somebody was denied , and he had a system that was a <unk> system .
and last week , in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior writers that question , whether it was possible for possible people died because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a row of this ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a <unk> needs to be when you have a website with <unk> service with a <unk> service , for example .
now , we use all , or many of us , or a lot of us , or one of their competitors , but these services are in particular , in <unk> states like iran , where muslims foreign differences , because they know that the local government cannot be able to <unk> their <unk> .
but can &apos;t you , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> + fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens is in the case of <unk> .
how does it happen to the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt for instance ?
well , in egypt , the convention in egypt , the convention headquarters in april , the headquarters of the egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this files , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were in germany , the egyptian government had a few programs that had sold the egyptian government in a few programs with -- in fact , in very large framework -- any of communication -- could capture the egyptian citizens .
they had this program for <unk> euro euro <unk> the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments are <unk> governments with <unk> , so they can do that for their own citizens .
but western governments also help himself .
for instance , in germany , just a few weeks ago , what was called <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> that used to be used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in a <unk> , then you &apos;ll get pretty safety <unk> , and then you will have your phone <unk> .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer is the obvious answer of the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really do me because i &apos;m a citizen citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide anything . &quot;
and that argument that makes no sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , 2011 , we have our governments , 2011 , our governments , is every right we &apos;re getting for forever .
and we trust that , trust ourselves , we don &apos;t know , one of the future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to do the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> became very quickly the <unk> of the world &apos;s most quickly <unk> in the world .
they put us into the shoes , things that were larger than we , buildings , bridges , a brick after we have , buildings , a brick .
so basically the <unk> was built for the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
it &apos;s got &quot; <unk> rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego would get a <unk> .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones , or 75 stones , or 75 stones on every person on this planet .
they have to be an engineer to be beautiful , beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego made it for all possible .
lego has basically the <unk> , the building block of the world , and it made a block of the building block .
in the same year , the bell labs was the next year at the bell labs , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> that &apos;s a little <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> building building building building blocks building building everything .
so , as the <unk> , allows us to build much more complex , more complex loops , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time to experts is so that , and therefore decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea how to make the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
i started a couple of years ago to develop <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic <unk> , which has a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
so they can &apos;t sit around them around it .
the stones are <unk> .
green is a matter , blue is power , pink is input and orange is a <unk> .
so all you need to do is a blue and a green one , and they &apos;re able to connect to bigger <unk> of them , and they can build very quickly .
they add a blue one blue on a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between the nest , and they have a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , this is , and they have a little <unk> .
and then they put this <unk> for a little bit and they made a <unk> .
i will stop that .
and the simple thing is , actually , is actually quite powerful .
instead of that , you need to program or <unk> or <unk> , allowing you to be simple , intuitive gestures gestures you &apos;re using simple <unk> gestures .
so to accelerate that , or to slow down , just just turn on this button , and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the <unk> is that there is a growing library .
we want to have every single interaction on this world in a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- all should be available .
we have <unk> children &apos;s <unk> and they &apos;re going to play them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how they start the electronics that they understand in the everyday , and they &apos;re not going to learn to school .
like , for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> respond to touch .
we also have <unk> <unk> .
so we had no experience for designers with no experience in electronic things that started with more than material material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we have <unk> , and gave them some designers that had no technical experience of having no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what do you . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my favorite <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> of play-doh , fear in the darkness .
for those <unk> , <unk> , another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so open source source .
you can go on the website , all the <unk> and they make it .
we want to the world of the creator , the inventor , the <unk> , because the world that we live , these interactive world , is that we heard these interactive world .
so , they &apos;re pulling them up and start to invent .
thank you .
