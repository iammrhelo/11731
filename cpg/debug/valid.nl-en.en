<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .

<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	About a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires .
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wires . &quot;
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire .
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	So at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect .
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	This was the result .
<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .

<keywords>talks, astronomy, energy, exploration, physics, science, technology</keywords>	en	I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;

<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	As you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically ,
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	arranging it the way we wanted ?
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building Siftables .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	In a nutshell , a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	They &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	Most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	And as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nuance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So , I &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	This Siftable is configured to show video , and if I tilt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	And these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	If they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	And they can also sense their motion and tilt .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	One of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So in this case , we &apos;ve got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	If we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	There are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So here I &apos;m -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I &apos;m making with a simple equation program .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	Here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	Basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	Then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .

<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .

<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable . There are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	And then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So let &apos;s have a look .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	Video : DM : We &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .

<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	So I don &apos;t have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvise , making it longer or shorter as I go .
<keywords>talks, art, business, children, computers, design, education, invention, music, technology, toy</keywords>	en	And now , finally , I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable , tilted to the left .

<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	But , when it comes to writing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	is why ? You know , is it rational ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other careers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?

<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	But to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	We writers , we kind of do have that reputation ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Norman Mailer , just before he died , last interview , he said , &quot; Every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;

<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	But we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Are you comfortable with that ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assumption .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I think it &apos;s odious .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And I also think it &apos;s dangerous ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And I definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that I &apos;m in right now in my career .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Which is -- you know , like check it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And it &apos;s exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	So Jesus , what a thought !
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	That &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o &apos;clock in the morning ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and I don &apos;t want to go there .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And so , the question becomes , how ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	So stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	But , ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , OK ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &quot; daemons . &quot;
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Socrates , famously , believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	The Romans had the same idea ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Which is great , because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	They believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	kind of like Dobby the house elf ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and would shape the outcome of that work .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	So brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	So the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	If your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	If your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And then the Renaissance came and everything changed ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And for the first time in history , you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius , rather than having a genius .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	You know , I think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	It &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Can we do this differently ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Maybe not .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Maybe we can &apos;t just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically , fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	But the question that I kind of want to pose is --
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	you know , why not ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Why not think about it this way ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal . I had this encounter recently
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet . She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her ,
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	She would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page .

<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits ,

<keywords>talks, creativity, culture, entertainment, personality, poetry, work, writing</keywords>	en	And we were talking about this ,

<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been digitizing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We &apos;ve tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We &apos;ve been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ;
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory ,
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We &apos;re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	When we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours --
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	trust me , this is simple --
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	A chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing ,
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We started this over 15 years ago .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it &apos;s a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174 .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We designed the pieces , went through our error correction
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	They laughed more than you guys are .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	But we wanted to go much larger :
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	it &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code --
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	so we thought we &apos;d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	When we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We design unique elements into this .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	You may have read that we put watermarks in .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code -- A , C , G and T.
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there &apos;s a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Initially , all we did was autograph it .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ;
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	At each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .

<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? How do we activate this ?
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ;
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cloning .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	With bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice --
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome ,
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins ,
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here . The new chromosome went into the cell .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The chromosome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ;
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	the chromosome we put in does .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	All the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had transferred in .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
<keywords>talks, alternative energy, creativity, energy, genetics, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now I &apos;ve argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .

<keywords>talks, anthropology, culture, environment, film, global issues, language, photography</keywords>	en	I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	All of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	One effect , paradoxically , is that it produces paralysis , rather than liberation .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	With so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	I &apos;ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard , the gigantic mutual-fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered , rate of participation went down two percent .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . Why ?
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	Because with 50 funds to choose from , it &apos;s so damn hard to decide which fund to choose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	and of course tomorrow never comes .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	By not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices . And I think it makes the world look like this .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	&#91; And lastly , for all eternity , French , bleu cheese , or ranch ? &#93;

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	So that &apos;s one effect .

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	And there are several reasons for this .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salad dressing is ? --

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	I believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high ,

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	This is the official dogma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all false .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	It is not true .

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	Now , as a policy matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this :
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	So the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , Western societies .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this : Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don &apos;t help .

<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	What I &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help . They actually hurt .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	They actually make us worse off .
<keywords>talks, business, choice, culture, decision-making, economics, happiness, personal growth, potential, psychology</keywords>	en	If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be improved ,
