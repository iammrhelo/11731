<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Several years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	called the marshmallow challenge .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And the idea &apos;s pretty simple : Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	The marshmallow has to be on top .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And it was a huge success .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And since then , I &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jockey for power .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Then they spend some time planning , organizing ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	they sketch and they lay out spaghetti .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-da ! --
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	they admire their work .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; turns into an &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	They lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; structures ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	As Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti , Inc . Right ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	They don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	But there &apos;s another reason as well .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And then they execute on it .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s a crisis .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Sound familiar ? Right .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	What kindergarteners do differently
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	is that they start with the marshmallow ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	and they build prototypes , successive prototypes ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So the average for most people is around 20 inches ;
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	kindergarteners , better than most adults .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Who does the very best ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Architects and engineers , thankfully .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I &apos;ve seen .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And why is it ? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So CEOs , a little bit better than average ,
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	but here &apos;s where it gets interesting . If you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	You can just tell beforehand . And why is that ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Because they have special skills of facilitation .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	They manage the process , they understand the process .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	If you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And I tried something interesting .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So what do you think happened to these design students ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	What was the result ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Here &apos;s what happened :
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Not one team had a standing structure .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	If anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high stakes have a strong impact .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	We did the exercise again with the same students .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	What do you think happened then ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So now they understand the value of prototyping .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	Because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	There &apos;s step-by-step instructions on this .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	There &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
<keywords>talks, business, collaboration, culture, design, entertainment, psychology</keywords>	en	And that can make a big difference .

<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	So that &apos;s the good news .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	Unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .

<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	That number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s disgraceful .

<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	So the question is : Can we do that ? And I think we can .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wishful thinking .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	But here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night :
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	We &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . Never . And we &apos;ve also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	We &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields ,
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the Enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now . People wrap themselves in their beliefs ,
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free . Not even the truth will set them free .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress . But you know what you &apos;re not entitled to ?
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	You &apos;re not entitled to your own facts . Sorry , you &apos;re not .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And this took me awhile to figure out .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	About a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . A little story .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And I was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	Same thing , only bigger .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	People were going crazy .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	But , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on . I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . We type , we file , we go to dinner . It &apos;s fine .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	But these stories bothered me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually I did .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And that &apos;s because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fanatics at all .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	They were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	They were exactly like the people in this room .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And it just disturbed me so much .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest . We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	We talk about it ambivalently .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it :
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	&quot; progress . &quot;
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	We &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .

<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	And the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	About 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .

<keywords>talks, global issues, medicine, religion, science, writing</keywords>	en	But since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry King Live . &quot;

<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Now , I have a plan for this , and it entails convincing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .

<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But actually , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , actually the opposite is true .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	I &apos;ve calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in :
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	If we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .

<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Here &apos;s why . This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . Truly .

<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We do achieve more in game worlds . But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters -- inspired to collaborate and to cooperate .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And when we &apos;re in game worlds , I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We feel overcome , we feel overwhelmed ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	we feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	they just don &apos;t exist in games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ?
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission , right away .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Right ? So you can do it .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They never give you a challenge you can &apos;t achieve .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But it is on the verge of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to try hard .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft ; no sitting around ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	wringing your hands --
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	There are also tons of collaborators .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	That &apos;s not something we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	and we get all this positive feedback .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	You guys have heard of leveling up , + 1 strength , + 1 intelligence .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 speaking , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	I don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	It &apos;s just better than reality .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	It might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	That was the first upright primate .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But it &apos;s also apt , because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	This is true . I believe this .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , consider this really interesting statistic ;
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University :
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	First of all , for children in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school , from fifth grade to high school graduation , if you have perfect attendance .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , we have an entire parallel track of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell &apos;s new book &quot; Outliers , &quot;
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	so you would have heard of his theory of success , the &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory of success .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	It &apos;s based on this great cognitive-science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtuosos at it .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are gamers getting so good at ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	These are our virtuoso gamers ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	If you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	The game industry is developing consoles that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet , so that gamers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So I &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Here are the four things I came up with . The first is urgent optimism .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	OK , think of this as extreme self-motivation .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying , and trying now .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Gamers don &apos;t sit around .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Blissful productivity . I love it .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week -- kind of a half-time job .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happier working hard than we are relaxing , or hanging out .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We know that we are optimized as human beings , to do hard and meaningful work .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Finally : epic meaning .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective :
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft wiki .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Five million people use it every month .

<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing :
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And the only problem is , they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	There &apos;s an economist named Edward Castronova .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	His work is brilliant . He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And he &apos;s an economist , so he &apos;s rational .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And he says -- Not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exuberant .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ;
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	These are ancient dice , made out of sheep &apos;s knuckles .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this history ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	which is the history of who invented games and why .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Herodotus says that games , particularly dice games , were invented in the kingdom of Lydia , during a time of famine .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Apparently , there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	People were suffering . People were fighting .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	It was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games , and they set up a kingdom-wide policy :
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	On one day , everybody would eat ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	and on the next day , everybody would play games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games , because games are so engaging , and immerse us in such satisfying , blissful productivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And then on the next day , they would play games ;
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	and on the next day , they would eat .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And according to Herodotus , they passed 18 years this way ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	surviving through a famine , by eating on one day , and playing games on the next .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using games today . We &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering --
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	we &apos;re using games to get away
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satisfying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	This is really exciting .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They divided the entire kingdom in half .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They would leave Lydia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live ,
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Now , this sounds crazy , right ?
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	But recently , DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans , who then led to the Roman Empire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And so , recently , scientists have suggested that Herodotus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years , that could have explained the famine .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	So this crazy story might be true .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	They might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	Okay , we can do that .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 .

<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	And the premise was , a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
<keywords>talks, computers, design, entertainment, gaming, global issues, play</keywords>	en	This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System , of course .

<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I &apos;ve loved only two .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	That first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	What a fish .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Even better , it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So you could feel good about selling it .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Absolutely , &quot; I said .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs :
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	How do we keep fish on our menus ?
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they &apos;ve collapsed .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	There &apos;s almost nothing left .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	A lot of arguments against it :
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . Take tuna ,
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	a major drawback .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Not very sustainable .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I wanted to support them .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The day before the event , I called the head of P.R. for the company .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Let &apos;s call him Don .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And then he added , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	That feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said . &quot; Best in the business . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	2.5 to one , great .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; 2.5 what ? What are you feeding ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Great , &quot; I said . Got off the phone .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He said he didn &apos;t know . He would ask around .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	no one could give me a straight answer
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Let &apos;s call him Don too .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I said , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He said , &quot; Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I said , &quot; What percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Thinking , you know , two percent .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	There was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I fell out of love with this fish .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	No , not because I &apos;m some self-righteous , goody-two shoes foodie .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I actually am .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	No , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	She kind of set us up .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The chef had overcooked it .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Like twice over .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Amazingly , it was still delicious .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been overcooked ?
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Let &apos;s call him Miguel --
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	actually his name is Miguel .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef ,
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	at least in the way that you and I understand it .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s at the tip of the Guadalquivir river .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They did it by draining the land .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And ecologically , it was a disaster .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It killed like 90 percent of the birds ,
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	What did they do ?
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They reversed the flow of water .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They literally flipped the switch .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They flooded the canals .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They created a 27,000-acre fish farm -- bass , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the process , Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The farm &apos;s incredible .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I was there not long ago with Miguel .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Okay ? There we are slogging through the wetlands , and I &apos;m panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology lecture .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He said , &quot; Fish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And then he &apos;s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So I interrupted him . I said , &quot; Miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He pointed at the algae .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : It &apos;s amazing .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	But what are your fish eating ?
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	What &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	There is no feed .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	At that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Look at their bellies , pink .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They &apos;re feasting . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Feasting ? I was totally confused .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I said , &quot; Miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I said , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He shook his head , no .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He said , &quot; We farm extensively , not intensively .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	This is an ecological network .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The flamingos eat the shrimp .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Okay , so let &apos;s review :
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	A fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	They do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway A92 .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	No kidding .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I was imagining a &quot; March of the Penguins &quot; thing , so I looked at Miguel .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I said , &quot; Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious -- and I don &apos;t like fish skin ;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I don &apos;t like it seared , I don &apos;t like it crispy .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I almost never cook with it .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	He said , &quot; The skin acts like a sponge .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It evolved to soak up impurities . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . &quot;
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish ,
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , &quot; he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	It &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	And when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	The system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	So , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant --
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	Because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the Atlantic .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	You might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bass or beef cattle .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
<keywords>talks, agriculture, biology, environment, food, health</keywords>	en	We &apos;re not realists , us foodies ;

<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	In high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You know , I was a real science geek .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans . Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I was an artist .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I could draw . I could paint .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	That was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And an interesting thing happened : The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday --
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But I didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Since then , in the intervening 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I &apos;ve learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Nature &apos;s imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But when I chose a career as an adult , it was filmmaking .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And with &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , you know , merging the two passions .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Something interesting came out of &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And this resulted in the first soft-surface character , CG animation that was ever in a movie .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- barely broke even , I should say -- I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	They were seeing something magical .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And so that got me very excited .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , with &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much farther .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Working with ILM , we created the liquid metal dude in that film . The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And it did , and we created magic again ,
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	and we had the same result with an audience --
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	although we did make a little more money on that one .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , I started a company with Stan Winston , my good friend Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time , and it was called Digital Domain .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , I wrote this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG , and the main characters would all be in CG , and the world would be in CG . And the envelope pushed back ,
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , I shelved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You know , I went and pitched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Juliet &apos; on a ship :
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	&quot; It &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Secretly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of &quot; Titanic . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And that &apos;s why I made the movie .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And that &apos;s the truth . Now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	We &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	It will be really important . It will be a great marketing hook . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I talked them into funding an expedition .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Sounds crazy . But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port . Not a movie , not HD -- for real .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Now , that blew my mind .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I thought like , &quot; Wow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	This is really cool . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Of course , the curiosity , the science component of it --
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	it was everything . It was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination . And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that window .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	As we did some of our subsequent expeditions , I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , I was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	After the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I &apos;m going to go be a full-time explorer for a while . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And so , we started planning these expeditions .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And we wound up going to the Bismark , and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	We went back to the Titanic wreck .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	When I say , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle . I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	It was really , really quite profound .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals --
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	they &apos;re basically aliens right here on Earth .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	They live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	They don &apos;t survive on sunlight-based system the way we do .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-Centigrade water plumes .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And this was fascinating .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I &apos;d completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Why am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;

<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	No fame , no glory , no money . What are you doing ?
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .

<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And it really changed the dynamic .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; Avatar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Tremendously exciting .

<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	To me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .

<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You know , what are the lessons learned ?
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Well , I think number one is curiosity .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .

<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	Other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself ,
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	and take risks . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	NASA has this phrase that they like : &quot; Failure is not an option . &quot;
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	You have to be willing to take those risks .
<keywords>talks, adventure, entertainment, film, nature, oceans, storytelling, submarine, technology, writing</keywords>	en	So , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . Thank you .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	If I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts ,
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	and instead of thinking about information overload , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	This tool that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	It &apos;s called Pivot , and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say , accidents .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerges .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	This is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most frail .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death ,
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	If we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	With Pivot , you can drill into a decade .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	You can drill into a particular year .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	You can jump right into a specific issue .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan , so I &apos;ll go ahead and I &apos;ll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which Lance Armstrong &apos;s been a part of .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	Now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So I can step back , and expand on that .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And I see Greg LeMond now .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out -- you &apos;re not searching , you &apos;re not browsing .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	But even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	Right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	I &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	Now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	It &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	Looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government ;
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	some have come from natural sciences ;
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	some , fewer still , have come from business --
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	there &apos;s my boss --
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	and one has come from music .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And interestingly enough , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	I &apos;m just showing the New York Times website here .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So Pivot , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So I can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	Now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So I can drill into what I &apos;ve done over specific time frames .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	Here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history --
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	here , I was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for Bing , over here for Live Labs Pivot .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And from these , I can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	It &apos;s one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	We talk about the curse of information overload .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	We talk about drowning in data .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	If we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	And if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
<keywords>talks, data, demo, interface design, technology, web</keywords>	en	So with that , I thank you .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Everybody talks about happiness these days .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	I had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	There is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	There is a lot of happiness coaching .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Everybody would like to make people happier .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	But in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	and that was a story --
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	But it hadn &apos;t .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	What it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	He had had the experience .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	What this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	or &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; or something like that .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And let me begin with one example .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	This is an old study .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	I won &apos;t go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Here are two patients ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	those are their recordings .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And you are asked , &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And it &apos;s a very easy question .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Clearly , Patient B suffered more --
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And here is a surprise . The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ... but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	it &apos;s a bad story .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	How do we know that ? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	From the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	That will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	What defines a story ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	What defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It has moments of experience , one after the other .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And you can ask : What happens to these moments ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And the answer is really straightforward :
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	They are lost forever .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	in a month , there are about 600,000 --
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	From the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	You have not changed the story .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ;
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	time has very little impact on the story .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	The experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	we choose between memories of experiences . And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	We think of our future as anticipated memories .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need . I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And this is a bit hard to justify I think .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vacations .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	There seems to be a discrepancy .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	What are the emotions that can be measured ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	This is not about how happily a person lives .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Very different notion .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately . The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	and there have been other efforts along those lines .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	So in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; how much would you know about his height ?
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	You have that much uncertainty . If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	So the correlation is low .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	There are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It is a completely different notion .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	When you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	But now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	And it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	Well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	We know that .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	But one thing will happen : They will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio ,
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	and they will feel they made the right decision .
<keywords>talks, brain, culture, economics, happiness, mind, philosophy, psychology, science</keywords>	en	It is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The climate getting worse means that many years , their crops won &apos;t grow :

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	But , as we make it cheaper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint , and that constraint has to do with CO2 .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	CO2 is warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects :
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are , there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not very much .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I asked the top scientists on this several times :
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Do we really have to get down to near zero ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so that &apos;s a big challenge .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s very different than saying &quot; We &apos;re a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . &quot;
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is something that has to get to zero .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	For each American , it &apos;s about 20 tons ;

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s been constantly going up .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This equation has four factors ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	a little bit of multiplication :
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now that &apos;s back from high school algebra , but let &apos;s take a look .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	First , we &apos;ve got population .

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The second factor is the services we use .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This encompasses everything : the food we eat , clothing , TV , heating .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	These are very good things : getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	In the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so , overall here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	But for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so the question is : Can you actually get that to zero ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	If you burn coal , no .

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so , we need energy miracles .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now , when I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really capture this ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So here we have some natural fireflies .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now , there &apos;s all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability , and , although there &apos;s many directions people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I &apos;ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long-term issue .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Who &apos;s going to be sure ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is a lot of volume .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So that &apos;s a tough one .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Next would be nuclear .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It also has three big problems :
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ;
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And then what do you do with the waste ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	People need to feel good about it .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grouped together .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is energy farming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Also , these are intermittent sources .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it &apos;s not available .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	we have transmission challenges :
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And , finally , this storage problem .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And , to dimensionalize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now , this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	If you &apos;re counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Is it a Manhattan Project ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	In each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Bill Gross has several companies , including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Vinod Khosla &apos;s investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	There are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The idea of TerraPower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent , which is the U235 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the U238 . &quot;
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It is kind of a crazy idea .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	and so it &apos;s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	You actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today &apos;s reactors .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	You can see it &apos;s a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	In terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is the leftover , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	so it &apos;s called depleted uranium .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And , simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So let &apos;s think : How should we measure ourselves ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	What should our report card look like ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	For 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	That really is very important , that we get there .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , the other grade is : Are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	That &apos;s super important .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	That &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Well , again , it should have the two elements .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions :
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The less we emit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	But in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	These breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	There &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The Al Gore book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly , because we need broad backing for this .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So this is a wish .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who &apos;s president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is the one with the greatest impact .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	If we don &apos;t get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , what do we have to do ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	We need to go for more research funding .

<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Thank you . So to understand more about TerraPower , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Bil Gates : To actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	The tough thing is building the pilot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	Once you get the first one built , if it works as advertised , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	CA : And so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	BG : That &apos;s right . Today , you &apos;re always refueling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out ,
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	that &apos;s not good .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	CA : It &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	BG : Yeah . Well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors --
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	CA : I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here . Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	BG : Well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China --
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	I &apos;ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	So I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have done some work .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	This is a variant on something that has been done .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	It &apos;s an important advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	CA : So , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	BG : Well , we need -- for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
<keywords>talks, TED Brain Trust, business, energy, global issues, invention, science, technology</keywords>	en	That &apos;s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .

<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	So , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I &apos;m going to make an admission :

<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .

<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	And there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs , I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second .

<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	So again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	There was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .

<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	Well , they took , over a three-month period , D-level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright ,
<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at A-level .
<keywords>talks, activism, happiness, health, prosthetics, social change, society</keywords>	en	And , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
