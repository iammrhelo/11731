( Arabic ) I seek refu@@ ge in Allah from cur@@ sed Sat@@ an . In the Na@@ me of Allah , the most Gr@@ acious , the most M@@ erci@@ ful .
( English ) I was born in a middle class family .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a business@@ man .
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
So I guess I was the lucky one .
My mother had 16 pregn@@ ancies .
From 16 pregn@@ ancies , five of us are alive .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
Day to day , I watched women being carried to a gra@@ ve@@ yard , or watched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ yard .
At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I completed my education , but I wanted to go to university .
Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dor@@ mit@@ ory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
So as a result , my father sent me to America .
I came to America .
I completed my education .
While I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was invaded by Russia .
And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
My family was in a refugee camp .
So as soon as I completed my education , I brought my family to America .
I wanted them to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Day after day , when I listened to the news , when I followed what was going on with my country , my heart was breaking up .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
I was a professor at a university .
I earned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the refugee camp .
And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan , there were 7@@ .5 million refugees . 7@@ .5 million refugees .
About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
when I went day-to-day to do a survey , I found things you never could imagine .
I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and we@@ eping and not knowing what to do .
I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10@@ -to-@@ 12@@ -@@ year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
So it was a very devastating situation .
My heart was beating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
At that moment , we talk about momentum .
At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
How could I help these people ?
I am one individual . What can I do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
It transformed me . It gave me status .
It gave me confidence . It gave me a career .
It helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
But do you think it was easy ?
No , because at that time , education was banned for girls , completely .
And also , by Russia inv@@ ading Afghanistan , people were not trusting anyone .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
Somebody who comes from the United States .
Somebody who got educated here .
Did they trust me ? Of course not .
So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and surveyed and looked and looked .
I asked .
Finally , I found one man .
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ lah .
I went to his tent in the camp , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Crazy woman , crazy woman , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his compound , the word spread all over .
In a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 15,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
one day I was in the office in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , Pakistan .
All of a sudden , I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me , &quot; &quot; Ru@@ n away , hide ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
You &apos;re scared . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on the line .
But as a leader , you have to hold it together .
You have to hold it together and show strength .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
So I invited them to the office .
They came , and there were nine of them — nine Taliban .
They were the u@@ gli@@ est looking men you can ever see .
( Laughter ) Very mean@@ -@@ looking people , black clothes , black tur@@ ban , and they pour into my office .
And I invited them to have a seat and have tea .
They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
And of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very scary , but I was really shaking up .
But also I was strong , holding myself up .
And , of course , by that time , you know how I dress — I dress from head to toe in a black hi@@ ja@@ b .
The only thing you could see , my eyes .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
Don &apos;t you know that school is banned for girls ?
What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
We have some students coming , and they are all learning Koran , Holy Book .
And you know , Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obe@@ y their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking P@@ ash@@ to .
They talked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I offered them tea again , and they took a sip and they left .
By that time , my staff poured into my office .
They were scared to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
( Laughter ) Of course , I was happy to be alive .
But also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban — of course during the Taliban there is another story .
We went underground and we provided education for 80 school@@ girls , 3,000 students underground , and continuously we trained .
With the fall of the Taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
We opened women &apos;s learning center .
We continuously opened clinics .
We worked with mothers and children .
We had reproductive health training .
We had all kinds of training that you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was delighted with the outcome of my work .
And one day , with four train@@ ers and one bo@@ dy@@ guard , I was going up north of Kabul , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
Ri@@ fl@@ es on their shoulders , they blocked the road .
And I told my driver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the driver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ dy@@ guard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
And by that time , the women are yelling and screaming inside the car .
I am very sha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it .
This time , we all are going to be killed .
There is no doubt in my mind .
But still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
My leg was shaking , and I got outside .
And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
We know where you are going .
Every day you go up north here and there .
You train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
You build their skills . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK .
The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gun and kill .
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
It &apos;s a trap to me , of course .
So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I walked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the driver , &quot; &quot; Tur@@ n around and go back to the office . &quot; &quot; At that time , we only were supporting girls .
We only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
By the time I came to the office , of course my train@@ ers were gone .
They ran away home . Nobody stayed there .
My bo@@ dy@@ guard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
I was sha@@ ken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
Because we had training going on up north already .
Hundreds of women were there coming to get training .
So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful donors called me about a report .
And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sa@@ k@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; And I answered her .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I tried to cover .
No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I told her the whole story .
At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same route , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the ri@@ fle and pointing to us to stop the car .
So we stopped the car .
I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
So I took them to the mosque , and to make a long story short , I told them I &apos;d give them teachers .
Today , they are the best train@@ ers .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my guides .
Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . They are ahead , and we go .
And they protect us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That tells you that education transforms people .
When you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
We cannot only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time .
( Laughter ) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
So we are continuously giving training to men , and I really believe strongly .
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful , peaceful country .
We were going everywhere .
Women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
We never locked our doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Today , people cannot walk out of their door without security issues .
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
They are training to be doctors , back again .
They are training to be teachers , and they are running businesses .
So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of trust and honesty .
If you have these few things with you , you will accomplish .
We have one poet , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī .
He said that by having compassion and having love , you can conquer the world .
And I tell you , we could .
And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
Thank you very , very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
At the time , I was cardio@@ logist at UC@@ LA , speci@@ alizing in cardiac imaging techniques .
The call came from a veter@@ in@@ arian at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o .
An elderly female chimpanzee had wo@@ ken up with a facial dro@@ op and the veter@@ in@@ arians were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the zoo and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause .
Now , to be clear , North American z@@ oos are sta@@ ffed by highly qualified , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ certified veter@@ in@@ arians who take out@@ standing care of their animal patients .
But occasionally , they do reach into the human medical community , particularly for some speci@@ ality consul@@ tation , and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help .
I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gor@@ illa didn &apos;t have a torn a@@ ort@@ a , evaluate this ma@@ ca@@ w for a heart mur@@ m@@ ur , make sure that this California sea lion &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ dium wasn &apos;t infl@@ amed , and in this picture , I &apos;m listening to the heart of a lion after a lifesa@@ ving , collaborative procedure with veter@@ in@@ arians and physicians where we dra@@ ined 700 c@@ c &apos;s of fluid from the sa@@ c in which this lion &apos;s heart was contained .
And this procedure , which I have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that pa@@ w and that tail .
Now most of the time , I was working at UC@@ LA Medical Center with physicians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o with veter@@ in@@ arians , discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients .
And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on r@@ ounds at UC@@ LA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
Phys@@ icians and veter@@ in@@ arians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients : cong@@ estive heart failure , brain tumors , le@@ u@@ ke@@ mia , diabetes , ar@@ thri@@ tis , ALS , breast cancer , even psychiatric syndr@@ omes like depression , anxiety , compul@@ sions , eating disorders and self-@@ injury .
Now , I &apos;ve got a confession to make .
Even though I studied compar@@ ative physiology and evolutionary biology as an under@@ grad — I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory — learning about the significant over@@ lap between the disorders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wa@@ ke@@ -up call for me .
So I started wondering , with all of these over@@ l@@ aps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veter@@ in@@ arian , or cons@@ ult the veter@@ inary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever attended a veter@@ inary conference ?
For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
I mean , look , every single physician accep@@ ts some biological connection between animals and humans .
Every medication that we prescribe or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
But there &apos;s something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing cong@@ estive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the non@@ urban .
You know , we hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these gle@@ aming cathedr@@ als of technology .
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jun@@ g@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
Phys@@ icians and scientists , we accept intellec@@ tually that our species , Homo sapiens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Mozart or looking at pictures of the Mars R@@ over on my Mac@@ Book .
I feel that tu@@ g of human excep@@ tion@@ alism , even as I recognize the scientifically isol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ induced heart failure .
Around the year 2000 , human cardio@@ logists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induced heart failure .
It was described in a gam@@ bling father who had lost his life &apos;s savings with a roll of the dice , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the alter .
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uniquely human .
V@@ eter@@ in@@ arians had been diagnosing , treating and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals ranging from monkeys to fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos , from to deer to rab@@ bits , since the 1970s .
How many human lives might have been saved if this veter@@ inary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.@@ R. doc@@ s and cardio@@ logists ?
Sel@@ f-@@ injury .
Some human patients harm themselves .
Some pl@@ uck out pat@@ ches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
Some animal patients also harm themselves .
There are stal@@ lions that repeti@@ tively bite their fl@@ anks until they bleed .
But veter@@ in@@ arians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-@@ injury in their self-@@ inj@@ uring animals .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this veter@@ inary knowledge be put into the hands of psycho@@ therap@@ ists and parents and patients struggling with self-@@ injury ?
Post@@ par@@ tum depression and post@@ par@@ tum psych@@ osis .
Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic .
They may neglect their newborn , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
Equ@@ ine veter@@ in@@ arians also know that occasionally , a mare , soon after giving birth , will neglect the fo@@ al , ref@@ using to nurse , and in some instances , kick the fo@@ al , even to death .
But veter@@ in@@ arians have devised an intervention to deal with this fo@@ al rejection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare .
Ox@@ y@@ tocin is the bon@@ ding hormone , and this leads to rene@@ wed interest , on the part of the mare , in her fo@@ al .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / gy@@ n &apos;s and family doctors and patients who are struggling with post@@ par@@ tum depression and psych@@ osis ?
Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the g@@ ulf between our fields remains large .
To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty laundry .
Some physicians can be real sno@@ bs about doctors who are not M@@ .D. &apos; s .
I &apos;m talking about denti@@ sts and op@@ t@@ ome@@ tri@@ sts and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
Of course , most physicians don &apos;t realize that it is harder to get into v@@ et school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , Homo sapiens , but veter@@ in@@ arians need to learn about health and disease in mammals , amphi@@ bi@@ ans , rep@@ tiles , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the ve@@ ts for feeling annoyed by my profession &apos;s con@@ descen@@ sion and ignorance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a veter@@ in@@ arian who can only take care of one species ?
A physician . ( Laughter ) C@@ losing the gap has become a passion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through programs like Darwin on R@@ ounds at UC@@ LA , where we &apos;re bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embed@@ ding them on our medical teams with our inter@@ ns and our residents .
And through Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity conferences , where we bring medical schools together with veter@@ inary schools for collabor@@ tive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients .
At Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity conferences , participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher ; how understanding poly@@ cystic over@@ ies in a Hol@@ stein cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods ; and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high-@@ str@@ ung S@@ hel@@ tie can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school .
In the United States and now internationally , at Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity conferences physicians and veter@@ in@@ arians check their attitudes and their pre@@ conceptions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
After all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physicians to embrace our patients &apos; and our own animal natures and join veter@@ in@@ arians in a speci@@ es-@@ sp@@ an@@ ning approach to health .
Because it turns out , some of the best and most human@@ istic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren &apos;t human .
And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and heal .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
Isn &apos;t it nice ?
( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; phe@@ w .
( Applause ) Having brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , shocking news for me .
I knew nothing about cancer .
In Western cultures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you disappear in a way .
Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exams , your lab values , a list of medicines .
You suddenly become a disease on legs .
Doctors start speaking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease , instead of with the human being .
They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doctor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; And in the meanwhile , you &apos;re left with questions to which nobody gives an answer .
These are the &quot; &quot; Can I ? &quot; &quot; questions : Can I work while I have cancer ?
Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?
Are there any other options ? &quot; &quot; And , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios , because they are very professional and dedicated to cur@@ ing you .
But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but class@@ ically , they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition , to get your friends and family engaged , or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going through .
But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
While I was in the hospital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-@@ out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it .
It was really hard to obtain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
I talked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me .
There &apos;s more to me .
A cure , wh@@ ichever it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital against medical advice .
I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dr@@ astic as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
So my best bet was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be access@@ ed by anyone .
So I created a website , which is called La Cur@@ a , on which I put my medical data , online .
I actually had to hack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
( Laughter ) I chose this word , La Cur@@ a — La Cur@@ a in Italian means &quot; &quot; the cure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things .
In our Western cultures , it means eradi@@ cating or rever@@ sing a disease , but in different cultures , for example , a culture from Asia , from the Mediterranean , from Latin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things .
Of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure .
And , it worked .
The La Cur@@ a website went viral .
I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts — emails , social networking — most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer , but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual .
For example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art performances were produced for La Cur@@ a .
For example , here we see Franc@@ es@@ ca Fin@@ i in her performance .
Or , as artist Patrick L@@ ich@@ ty has done : He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ verse .
Now you can have my cancer , too !
( Laughter ) Which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
And this was going on — scientists , the traditional medicine experts , several researchers , doctors — all connected with me to give advice .
With all this information and support , I was able to form a team of several neurosurge@@ ons , traditional doctors , onco@@ logists , and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving , which is very important .
And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
And the current strategy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
&#91; Sur@@ gery &#93; The follow-up MR@@ Is showed , luckily , little to no growth of the cancer .
So I was able to take my time and choose .
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with , I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in , and in the meanwhile , I was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt pity for me .
Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of La Cur@@ a .
What are the outcomes ?
I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
( Applause ) I had excellent news after the surgery — I have — I had a very low-@@ grade gli@@ oma , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot .
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery , which was very intense , a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And right before the operation , we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor , to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid .
Obviously , there were .
&#91; Open &#93; And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cur@@ a .
Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
Doctors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usually cons@@ ult when they think about cancer .
I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ ounding , continuous state of translation among many different languages , in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research .
&#91; Society &#93; The most important thing of La Cur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its components .
This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
( Applause ) .
Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. J@@ am@@ ire Williams on the drums , ( Applause ) Bur@@ n@@ is@@ s Tra@@ vis on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christian S@@ ands on the piano . ( Applause )
So the band@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
It is really a sacred space .
And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the band@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; T@@ iti B@@ oom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re responding .
You have no time for projected ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the band@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a pal@@ ette , that sounded like this ...
( Music ) So if Christian played a note — like play an F@@ . ( Music )
See , these are all right inside of the color pal@@ ette .
If you played an E.
See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional pal@@ ette that we were painting .
If you played an F # though , ( Dis@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ ette .
And at some point , Christian will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this pal@@ ette .
( Music ) So someone could concep@@ tually perceive that as a mistake .
The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;ll paint this pal@@ ette again .
He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a melody out of it .
The texture changed in the drums this time .
It got a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
So there is no mistake .
The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to in@@ corporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
So jazz , this band@@ stand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very puri@@ fying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
We know that to be able to come on the band@@ stand and play music is a blessing .
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
Well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stere@@ ot@@ y@@ pically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t mic@@ roman@@ age in jazz .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
If I come up and I dictate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of chaotic because I &apos;m bullying my ideas .
I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
This is a science of listening .
It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
Watch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
( Music ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nuanced .
It &apos;s not about bullying my vision or anything like that .
It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was here four years ago , and I remember , at the time , that the talks weren &apos;t put online .
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box , a box set of DV@@ Ds , which they put on their shelves , where they are now .
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis .
So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes , frankly .
( Laughter ) So , as I was saying — ( Laughter ) You see , he &apos;s right .
I mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously , and I think if people don &apos;t believe it , they should get out more .
( Laughter ) But I believe there is a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same urgency .
I believe fundamentally , as many speakers have said during the past few days , that we make very poor use of our talents .
Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of .
He said , &quot; &quot; There are two types of people in this world : those who divide the world into two types and those who do not . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I do . ( Laughter )
If you said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t do this anymore , &quot; &quot; they &apos;d wonder what you &apos;re talking about .
( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyran@@ ny of common sense .
( Laughter ) We suppress it . You know , this is our policy . ( Laughter )
We must dis@@ enth@@ r@@ all ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot; &quot; I love that word , &quot; &quot; dis@@ enth@@ r@@ all . &quot; &quot; You know what it means ?
That there are ideas that all of us are enth@@ r@@ alled to , which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things , the way things are .
Great . Now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you &apos;re wearing your w@@ ri@@ st@@ watch ?
And I say , &quot; &quot; No , no , it tells the date as well . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; It has multiple functions . &quot; ( Laughter )
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enth@@ r@@ alled to in education .
Everybody who &apos;s spoken at TED has told us imp@@ licitly , or sometimes explicitly , a different story : that life is not linear ; it &apos;s organic .
I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a fire@@ man . &quot; &quot; I asked , &quot; &quot; How long have you been a fire@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ways . I &apos;ve always been a fire@@ man . &quot;
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
He said I was throwing my life away if that &apos;s all I chose to do with it ; that I should go to college , I should become a professional person , that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It was humili@@ ating .
You know , I was thinking about that guy recently , just a few minutes ago when you were speaking , about this teacher , because six months ago , I saved his life . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; He was in a car wreck , and I pulled him out , gave him C@@ PR , and I saved his wife &apos;s life as well . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I think he thinks better of me now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , to me , human communities depend upon a diversity of talent , not a singular conception of ability .
And at the heart of our challenges — ( Applause ) At the heart of the challenge is to recon@@ stitute our sense of ability and of intelligence .
When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago , I came across a policy statement — very well-@@ inten@@ tioned — which said , &quot; &quot; College begins in kindergarten . &quot; &quot; No , it doesn &apos;t .
( Applause ) They &apos;re three .
But as we just heard in this last session , there &apos;s such competition now to get into kindergarten — to get to the right kindergarten — that people are being interviewed for it at three .
Kids sitting in front of un@@ impressed panels , you know , with their re@@ sumes — ( Laughter ) F@@ licking through and saying , &quot; &quot; What , this is it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; You &apos;ve been around for 36 months , and this is it ? &quot; ( Laughter )
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Cl@@ ap@@ ton got his first guitar .
And if you &apos;re doing the thing that you love to do , that you &apos;re good at , time takes a different course entirely .
You know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process ; it &apos;s an organic process .
And doing that , I think , is the answer to the future because it &apos;s not about scaling a new solution ; it &apos;s about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions , but with external support based on a personalized curriculum .
Now in this room , there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business , in multi@@ media , in the Internet .
These technologies , combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers , provide an opportunity to revolutionize education .
He wrote this to his love , Mau@@ d G@@ on@@ ne , and he was be@@ wa@@ iling the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
So most everyone watches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , ber@@ ate it .
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idiot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience .
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually dissemin@@ ate our entire value system .
So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience .
Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We &apos;re talking about top-@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ rated shows over the course of 50 years .
How do these Ni@@ el@@ sen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisi@@ tiveness .
As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these basic animal instincts .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel awe , we feel pity .
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be enter@@ tained .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
An@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ?
So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
We went back 50 years to the 195@@ 9 / 1960 television season .
We surveyed the top-@@ 20 Ni@@ el@@ sen shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3,@@ 600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?
Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
And on a fac@@ tual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exp@@ orted around the world .
So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
Two acknowled@@ gments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legen@@ dary rabbi , Jack S@@ tern .
And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community super@@ star Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen .
Okay , here we go .
So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that up@@ lift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
M@@ oral ambiguity are tele@@ visions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
M@@ oral ambiguity starts to climb .
Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wan@@ e .
Why ?
The Cu@@ ban Mis@@ si@@ le C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , M@@ L@@ K is shot , B@@ ob@@ by Kennedy is shot , Wat@@ er@@ gate .
Look what happens .
In 1970 , inspiration plumme@@ ts .
M@@ oral ambiguity takes off .
They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a tele@@ genic president , is in office .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran@@ -@@ Con@@ tra , the Chall@@ enger disaster , Chernobyl .
M@@ oral ambiguity becomes the dominant me@@ me in television from 1990 for the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social comm@@ entary and ir@@ rever@@ ence in blue and green .
Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bon@@ anz@@ a , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy Gri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
This is rising . Com@@ for@@ t stays whole .
I@@ r@@ rever@@ ence starts to rise .
Social comm@@ entary is all of a sudden spi@@ king up .
You get to 196@@ 9 , and look what happens .
You have comfort , ir@@ rever@@ ence , and social comm@@ entary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er Py@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 196@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ two@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ three-@@ rated television shows .
What &apos;s number one ?
The socially ir@@ rever@@ ent hip@@ pie show , &quot; R@@ owan and Martin &apos;s Laugh@@ -@@ In . &quot;
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Vi@@ e@@ wers had responded dramatically .
Look at this green spi@@ ke in 196@@ 6 to a be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show .
When you guys hear this industry term , a break@@ out hit , what does that mean ?
It means in the 196@@ 6 television season , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mothers Brothers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presi@@ dency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a break@@ out show .
So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts .
Com@@ for@@ t is no longer why we watch television .
Social comm@@ entary and ir@@ rever@@ ence rise throughout the 70s .
Now look at this .
The 70s means who ? Norman Le@@ ar .
You have &quot; &quot; All in the Family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ ford and Son , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top-@@ 10 for the entire 70s — &quot; MA@@ S * H@@ . &quot;
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for ir@@ rever@@ ence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-@@ 10 during the Ni@@ xon administration .
Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .
Archie B@@ un@@ ker was sho@@ ved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic .
You &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spi@@ ke in unemployment .
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?
No . In the 70s you have the be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ onic Woman &quot; &quot; that ro@@ cke@@ ted into the top-@@ 10 in 1973 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Mil@@ li@@ on-@@ Dol@@ lar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Charlie &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; Another spi@@ ke in the 1980s — another spi@@ ke in shows about control and power .
What were those shows ?
Gl@@ am@@ orous and rich .
&quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ y Island . &quot;
In@@ credible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-@@ camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV .
Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
The 90s — the big bubbles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Friends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ asi@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cheers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ el@@ d . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low unemployment .
But look : X marks the spot .
In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succum@@ bs to judgment once and for all .
Why not ?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court .
We had the bur@@ sting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x becomes part of the social lexicon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
What do people want in their TV then ?
I would have thought revenge or nos@@ tal@@ gia .
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
No , they want judgment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter dancing .
I can choose the next American I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fired .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinct remains .
We &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom .
The 1950s : June C@@ le@@ ever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Leave it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; Luc@@ ille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
Mau@@ de Fin@@ d@@ lay , the ep@@ it@@ ome of the ir@@ rever@@ ent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even men@@ opa@@ use on TV .
The 1980s , our first cou@@ gar was given to us in the form of Alex@@ is Car@@ r@@ ington .
Mur@@ phy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single par@@ enth@@ ood .
This era &apos;s mom , B@@ ree Van de K@@ amp .
Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television &apos;s shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
So to you all , the women of TED@@ Women , the men of TED@@ Women , the global audiences of TED@@ Women , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as viewers , through your collective social consci@@ ences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
So thanks very much .

In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cam@@ bodi@@ a , and I met a 12@@ -year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to coun@@ sel .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12@@ -year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
He was not a political prisoner .
He was a 12@@ -year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cam@@ bodi@@ a , but of the 1@@ 13 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en-@@ down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to coun@@ sel — it is what happens most of the time .
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
First is the training , empowerment , and connection of def@@ enders worldwide .
The second is insur@@ ing that there is systematic early access to coun@@ sel .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
And I founded International Bri@@ dges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and imple@@ menting due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in cour@@ tro@@ oms .
My first experiences , though , did come from Cam@@ bodi@@ a , and at the time I remember first coming to Cam@@ bodi@@ a and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attor@@ neys in the country because the K@@ h@@ mer Rou@@ ge had killed them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12@@ -year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
The first group of def@@ enders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ ended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with conf@@ essions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the conf@@ essions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
And it took a lot of courage for these def@@ enders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in imple@@ menting these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewel@@ ry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d mi@@ scar@@ ried .
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the def@@ enders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cam@@ bodi@@ a .
But Cam@@ bodi@@ a is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cam@@ bodi@@ a ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
In Bur@@ und@@ i I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12@@ -year-old boy , it was an 8@@ -year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eigh@@ ty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to coura@@ ge@@ ously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
For example , in Cam@@ bodi@@ a , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people mum@@ bling
and gr@@ um@@ bling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were t@@ ort@@ uring everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to def@@ enders .
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ yers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
Pros@@ ec@@ utors were perfectly trained .
But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to coun@@ sel , because they are the safe@@ guard in the system for people who are being tortured .
And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but def@@ enders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
We have a program called Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ Ma@@ kers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of imple@@ menting justice .
And there are 30 Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ Ma@@ kers throughout the world , from Sri L@@ anka to Swa@@ z@@ iland to the DR@@ C , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paral@@ eg@@ al programs , through whatever they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ Ma@@ kers , but people we coura@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communi@@ st League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support def@@ enders .
We need to systematically implement early access to coun@@ sel .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wil@@ dly idealistic .
Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the def@@ enders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only def@@ enders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vi@@ sh@@ na , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bri@@ dges to Justice .
Vi@@ sh@@ na was a 4@@ -year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cam@@ bo@@ dian prison in K@@ and@@ al Pro@@ v@@ ince . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vi@@ sh@@ na was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pin@@ kie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 15@@ 6 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corru@@ gated , and he would put his fingers through .
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vi@@ sh@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -year-old boy .
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prophe@@ tic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think that there &apos;s a TED Talk formula : &quot; Give a talk on a round , red ru@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Sh@@ are a childhood story . &quot;
&quot; Di@@ vul@@ ge a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; E@@ nd with an inspiring call to action . &quot;
No .
That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
In fact , if you over@@ use those devices , you &apos;re just going to come across as cli@@ ch@@ é@@ d or emotionally manipul@@ ative .
But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a ring@@ side seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers , like these .
I &apos;ve helped them prepare their talks for prime time , and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk .
And even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different , they actually do have one key common ingredient .
And it &apos;s this : Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners &apos; minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
Let me show you what I mean .
Here &apos;s Hal@@ ey .
She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly , she &apos;s terrified .
( Video ) P@@ res@@ enter : Hal@@ ey Van Dy@@ ck !
( Applause ) Over the course of 18 minutes , 1,@@ 200 people , many of whom have never seen each other before , are finding that their brains are starting to syn@@ c with Hal@@ ey &apos;s brain and with each other .
They &apos;re literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-@@ wave patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
Let &apos;s take a look inside Hal@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible t@@ angle .
But look here , right here — a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea .
And incredibly , this exact pattern is being re@@ created in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a pattern involving millions of neurons is being tel@@ ep@@ orted into 1,@@ 200 minds , just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .
But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
I@@ de@@ as come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic .
Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
Sir Ken Rob@@ in@@ son — creativity is key to our kids &apos; future .
( Video ) Sir Ken Rob@@ in@@ son : My cont@@ en@@ tion is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
Chris Anderson : El@@ ora Har@@ dy — building from bamboo is beautiful .
( Video ) El@@ ora Har@@ dy : It is growing all around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s elegant , it &apos;s earthqu@@ a@@ ke@@ -@@ resistant .
CA : Chi@@ mam@@ anda A@@ di@@ chi@@ e — people are more than a single identity .
( Video ) Chi@@ mam@@ anda A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are incomplete .
CA : Your mind is teeming with ideas , and not just randomly .
They &apos;re carefully linked together .
Coll@@ ectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
It &apos;s how you navigate the world .
And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
So , for example , if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kit@@ tens are ad@@ orable , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react like this .
But if another component of your worldview is the idea that leop@@ ards are dangerous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react a little bit differently .
So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial .
You need them to be as reliable as possible — a guide , to the scary but wonderful real world out there .
Now , different people &apos;s world@@ views can be dramatically different .
For example , how does your worldview react when you see this image : ( Video ) D@@ alia Mo@@ ga@@ hed : What do you think when you look at me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an expert , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
Or &quot; &quot; oppressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brain@@ washed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; ?
CA : Whatever your answer , there are millions of people out there who would react very differently .
If communicated properly , they &apos;re capable of changing , forever , how someone thinks about the world , and shaping their actions both now and well into the future .
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience , here are four guid@@ el@@ ines for how you should go about that task : One , limit your talk to just one major idea .
I@@ de@@ as are complex things ; you need to sl@@ ash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you &apos;re most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
You have to give context , share examples , make it vivid .
So pick one idea , and make it the through@@ -@@ line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
Two , give your listeners a reason to care .
Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
And the main tool to achieve that ?
Curiosity .
S@@ ti@@ r your audience &apos;s curiosity .
Use intriguing , provocative questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs explaining .
If you can reveal a dis@@ connection in someone &apos;s worldview , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
And once you &apos;ve sparked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners &apos; minds — but not your language , their language .
You start where they are .
The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences .
Now , metaph@@ ors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the des@@ ired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listener already understands .
For example , when Jennifer Ka@@ hn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word processor to edit DNA .
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying a@@ ha moment as it sn@@ aps into place in our minds .
It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
Four , here &apos;s the final tip : Make your idea worth sharing .
By that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Who does this idea benefit ? &quot;
And I need you to be honest with the answer .
If the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
The audience will see right through you .
But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brigh@@ ten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently , then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk , one that can be a gift to them and to all of us .
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear .
When I married my wife , I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time .
Secondly , the world is now so noisy , ( Noise ) with this ca@@ cop@@ hony going on visually and audit@@ ori@@ ly , it &apos;s just hard to listen ; it &apos;s ti@@ ring to listen .
And the art of conversation is being replaced — dangerously , I think — by personal broadcasting .
A world where we don &apos;t listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed .
Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to re@@ set your ears and to rec@@ ali@@ brate , so that you can hear the quiet again .
It &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
This , for example , is my tum@@ ble dr@@ yer .
So , mundane sounds can be really interesting — if you pay attention .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is O@@ ak Street , that &apos;s El@@ m Street .
This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 27@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
Stre@@ ets have names ; blocks are just the un@@ named spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lock 17 and this is B@@ lock 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
B@@ locks have names .
Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s B@@ lock 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the un@@ named spaces in between the blocks .
And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is Di@@ strict E@@ ight .
There &apos;s B@@ lock 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
So , you can hear it not just in the phr@@ asing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
