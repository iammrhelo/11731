( Arabic ) I &apos;m a joke in Altah , and I &apos;m a lot of noise from Stalins , and the Allah , the mystified and mystified .
I was going to sit in a family of a cloth .
The mother was five years old , and when I was born , and I was born , and I was born , and she was born , and she was really going to be a half years old .
There was no way that they were different , they had to go to school .
I &apos;ll give you a cup of tea .
My mother was born 16 children .
With 16 children , only five people have been out there .
Well , the news that was my childhood .
I &apos;ve seen women who are women who are on the party , who was a lot of people who were willing to know their own power .
When I finish my school , I had a family school , when I was working on my family school , when I was reading my family school , when I was reading my family school , and when I was reading my family school , I was going to study my family school , when I was reading my family school , when I was reading my family school , when I was reading my family school , and when I was reading my family school , I was going to study my family school , when I
I wanted to be the doctrine to help women and children .
And I got my eyes out of school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school , and I ended up school ,
I mean , I have no idea for the other day , because I was a good thing to do , and I was not going to have it in a medical doctor , but I didn &apos;t have a magnification .
And my father &apos;s reacting to me in Amira .
I moved to the Amdx .
I &apos;ve done my own education .
I was going to learn from the corner of the corner of the village .
You know , when I download a university , I didn &apos;t even know what I was going to share with my family and my whole journey .
I was going to go back , but I didn &apos;t know .
I was in the camp for the beans for the beans .
As soon as I finished , I moved to my family , I moved to the family .
I wanted them to live in the streets .
And then , was my heart ?
My heart was in Africa .
When the title was , I was going to get my head on , my heart , my heart , my heart , when I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my own life out of my body , but when I was in my head , my heart , my heart , I &apos;m going to get my head , and when I gave my body , my heart , my heart , my heart , when I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my own life , &quot; &quot; my heart
I was going back to my corner , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I
I was a good job .
I gave a university to learn .
And I went to the refugee camp .
When I gave up to this camp in Paxistan , I saw 7.5 million animals , I was going to see 7.5 million animals .
And 90 percent of them were women and women , and they were still in the world , and you know , when I was in the refugee camp , you know , you know , I was in the refugee camp .
I knew the things that you would not relate to me , and I knew the things that you would not relate to me .
I saw five and eight children who sat and cry , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a young woman who couldn &apos;t get a little slate , not a sense of education , a funny , who didn &apos;t even fit a place for life .
I saw the names of the boys who were passionate about their parents and their houses , they were a gateway , and they were a hack .
It was a very , very atrocious system .
And then we have a moment of momentum .
I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t do this for this man ? &quot;
How do I help them ?
And I realized that the transformation was transformed by my life .
She transformed me , I gave my status .
And I realized that I had to give you a sense of the study of education and health , and that was the way I started working .
Now , I was a light ?
Not because the police officer was a little bit fun .
And because Reveistan was called an Afghan , and I was going to have an Afghan officer .
I was going to go and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Has I am doing this ?
Did you give me a ? Nonetheless , not .
I have to go to the trust that I &apos;ve had to go trust and do this .
How do I do this ?
I interviewed the questions and noisy , noisy .
I &apos;ve got to go .
It was 80 years old .
He was a fly .
I went to it with the camp with the camp .
He looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; Your enemy , &quot; &quot; he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; Your girl is a woman , and I &apos;m going to say a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my job as a teacher . &quot; &quot; And when I started with my kids , the news was going to start .
It was about 25 schools , and 15,000 kids that were in these schools , they were a lot of fun .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So we &apos;re working , we &apos;re working , we &apos;re a teachers , we &apos;re a specialist , we &apos;re going to give you a good job , a person right , a good thing , you &apos;re a pro-thest , and you &apos;re going to talk about , you know , I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m
I was in the office in Petryward , Pucken , Pucken .
And I saw my father as my father &apos;s handers to get to the room , and they &apos;re going to be a bit more likely to tell me , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to hide ! &quot; &quot; When you see the menais , you &apos;re the idea that you &apos;re a business ?
You &apos;re halfway . You know , you know , it &apos;s not dangerous .
You know what your life is going to live .
But as a leader , you have to be male .
You have to have to catch a bridges .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
And I &apos;ve done them .
They were going . They would get there .
( Laughter ) These are the other people .
I &apos;ve brought them up and I got a harbor harbor .
They said , they said , they don &apos;t write .
They &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very much , and I was really the third way .
But I was a very good thing , I was working on my husband .
They said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ?
What are you going to do with this ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them — ( Laughter ) They looked at me in the eyes and said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to give it out there . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to give it out .
We have some students who are not going to give us some students .
And the Koran says that when you give the Koran in women , ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) — they started talking to the shoe .
And at that moment , I was going to put my harbor , and they started to start to get out .
Mantra supervisor started in the business .
And 3,000 students are not a good time , and 3,000 students are not a good time to put together .
It was going to have to be clear .
It was about mother and children .
The third thing is that the third of our health care is more than less health .
We &apos;ve done all the three things that you can imagine .
I was a swampless . I was a swampless .
Addis four sons , one of the same centers , and I &apos;ve come to the end of Kabul , and we &apos;ve got a lot of dust from the 19 jams of the 19 jams .
With the news , they gave us a gift to our own .
I asked the Netra : &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot; &quot; My achermen went out and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a good way to say it .
What do you need ?
This time we get it .
And it &apos;s not , it &apos;s a moment where you have to be a monetary moment .
And we wind up , you &apos;ve got to go .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
With a momentyn moment , you &apos;re going to keep the news and make it happen .
I went and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go . &quot; &quot; I went to the machine , sat in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car , sat down in my car ,
It &apos;s about to help them school , and that &apos;s why we can address them , and then what &apos;s the next .
Seventy-nine . No one ever gets caught .
I was only a teenager . I was a very passionate voice .
I thought , &quot; &quot; What do you do need to do ? &quot; &quot; How do I make a solution ?
They were coming up with hundreds of women to get the health care system .
And I &apos;m going to sit down , and I &apos;m a little bit of a talk about this , and I think that one of my great experiences was , I think , in my mother , I was talking about this one with my mother , and I was doing this one with my whole mother , and I was talking about it .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sacena ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Saces ? &quot; &quot; I said .
She said , &quot; &quot; This isn &apos;t you . What did you do with it ? &quot;
But this is not a doodle , the doorstep .
You &apos;ll help them . &quot; &quot; They were really cool .
And the way I said , I said , I know that teachers have to follow .
Today , these people are the best way to do .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s about what the human behavior changes .
When you learn people , you &apos;re teaching people , you know , if you &apos;re teaching people , you &apos;re teaching people , you know , if you &apos;re teaching people , you &apos;re teaching people , you know , if you &apos;re teaching people , you &apos;re teaching people , you know , if you &apos;re teaching people , you &apos;re teaching people , you know , if you &apos;re teaching people , you &apos;re teaching people , you know , if you &apos;re teaching people , you &apos;re teaching people , you know , if you
( Laughter ) The women &apos;s potential was involved .
I am sure ...
I live in a lawless , and I &apos;m going to get a good job .
I want to give you a little bit of a talk .
It was a beautiful horse , and it was a beautiful , thick , stare-like , thick , stare-like , reproductive .
We could be able to eat , we &apos;d like to eat .
You know what happened to my own ?
Today , people can &apos;t get out of the house without having a clerk about the guys .
But we want to go back to the end of Africa .
They get a lot of their seals and they &apos;re learning the same thing .
So , you &apos;ll see it going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going on .
I want to share with you this with this one of these things that are going to share with you that you &apos;ll share with this one of these things that are going to share with you that you &apos;ll share with this one of these things .
I said that I think that compassion and self can be brought back and still have a world .
An erurator , I think , is : What do you want to get ?
KH : Gamen , let &apos;s look at the look .
Carver : Parisian puridge , a little bit of the world &apos;s best car , cardiac paper , with the peer-to-peer , the peer-to-peer , the peer-to-peer chip , the pills of the Idnivoe , the signature of the Copeaf , and the seated chops .
KH : I &apos;m when the LHC , the Cablendment , the most under-off , is to make it a better way .
Dear : Shly you have a garden in the garden ?
We have an average high blood pressure .
KH : Let &apos;s get the breath of the rain , the square-bashut .
Number two : Physics .
I &apos;m going to give you a big job .
( Applause ) Mother Pang : I &apos;m a couple of tooly , how I learned to hold an alignment in my hand , and I &apos;m a little bit of cartoons in my toolbox with my third year .
And I also knew that I was also who the same as an anomatra .
The basic idea was to program health care , which is a lot of kids don &apos;t know .
When I realized that the authors are the ones that are cartoons I &apos;m going to take , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to make an architect ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;m going to be an anomaly , I don &apos;t know , or I &apos;m going to say that I am , but it &apos;s a big deal of express &apos;s life .
And the way that they would have been in love and the artist &apos;s discovery was really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really
But the interesting thing is that the computer technology has led to the idea of the creation of the &quot; &quot; Self-Organized &quot; &quot; — ( &quot; &quot; The Golden Depression &quot; &quot; — ( &quot; &quot; The Start Dead &quot; &quot; ) I was doing this with my computer , and I was trying to figure out what , when I was in my little sister in my little sister ?
Can there have a lot of machines where they &apos;re struggling to craft ?
So we &apos;ve been born with &quot; &quot; Self-Organized &quot; &quot; .
When I was four years old , tattoos told me how to put computers on the side and school on his nanny .
I have a journey of a journey of a book technology .
I was going to go to HTML , and I &apos;m going to go through the HTML , and I &apos;m going to teach you a JavaScript and Pyton .
I also think that I &apos;m also a new mindset that &apos;s going to go , &quot; &quot; The Experients . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s talking about bees and other people that exist in the audience , and they &apos;re using it .
If the flowers were not stuck with these experiences , then all of the biases , we &apos;re going to have a lot of threats to be .
So I decided to use these files and make them a superhero , and they decided to use the superhero to the superhero .

( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) So my job is to start with , but what is ideas about it ?
They can also get a rub .
The idea is to be mindful and new work .
And so , with the idea of the idea , it &apos;s really about the idea of the whole thing .
If not ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be there , we wouldn &apos;t be there , we wouldn &apos;t be a technology or a medical physicist , no way that we could be a society , no way , we would have a whole bunch of stuff , we wouldn &apos;t be a culture , we would have a whole bunch of stuff , we wouldn &apos;t be a culture , we would have a whole bunch of stuff , we wouldn &apos;t be a culture , we would have a whole bunch of stuff , we wouldn &apos;t
When I was eight years old , I was going to put my idea and open up the intelligence of Mother &apos;s ideas , and the message to the first and the first one is to create a model of Mother &apos;s education .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ll grow an echoly receding and accessories .
I am 13 , and I &apos;m not going to get a lot of my work in 2008 , 2008 , my mother &apos;s time .
And the numbers came up with me , and I wanted to help him , I wanted to help him , I would be able to help my firm , including my own life , including my own life , I would be able to help my firm .
I know that the rover of the rock in the front of the tree , I thought , I thought , well , you can make a decision or a little bit of the work — I &apos;ve had a little idea of the first time .
I noticed that when I was in my mother , I would have been wondering , &quot; &quot; How are you going to get my money off the street , &quot; &quot; and then I noticed , &quot; &quot; How are you going to write a lot of money ? &quot; &quot; I noticed , I would say , &quot; &quot; How do you want to write my own little bit of my money ? &quot; &quot; I noticed that I was going to be a good thing to write .
I felt like that , and I thought , well , that could be true and open .
I only had eight years , private boards , I didn &apos;t .
I only knew that I wanted to grow the way that we could grow the world , and I wanted to share with my way , I think , I &apos;m going to share with my life , I think , in my life .
My mother taught me to be a piece of my day , and I was going to go on my head for my house , and I was going to go and I was a slot and a whole bunch of names for every single way .
I started to make more raised more grown , like balloons and balloons .
The worst of my would start to take a whole world , I had a lot of CDO quotes , and I had a lot of CDC , and I had a lot of CDs , and I had a lot of other edges .
I mean , I was a lot of stuff , I was a lot of learning about leadership , and I think it &apos;s going to sell the answers to the extent that you have a better place , and then you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s better or worse .
The worst of the physics started .
And one thing I was doing was a bit connected to me , with Forees , &quot; Forests . &quot;
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me and I think I had a physicist in my own .
Most of me , I wonder , why would I think I would make a piece of my analogy ?
With a little bit of a sense of view , I was a little bit of a sense of view and self-empowerment , and I was in my life .
My parents taught me about the age of genetics , the way that you learn from the age , and the way you get to the whole journey .
I found out that I was a tooth , or a process of expressing the people and the world , and I started to think that even after the heart of the world , I started to see that even after the heart of the world , I started to see that even after that , I was going to get the same thing as I was doing .
With the process of discovery , we have a range of color in the world or with the raw .
It &apos;s frozen , and the way you get the strength and your nose is also the breath that they have .
So when I started with a firm , I knew two things : everything is going to be ecologically eclical , and that 10 percent of my pop will have to be a meat and a supernatural advocate .
( Applause ) I think the part of the new people who are good enough that not only do you want to do money to make money and then make a sense of light .
I believe that I can make my own money to make sure that we have to make a better sense of how much more sustainable life is .
We live in a big way , and we live in a big way , and then we &apos;ll get to get it more money to get it .
And the problem is that it &apos;s only about the way that it comes from the world and think of it as a matter of fact .
All right , we need to have a heart of the heart , because the transformation is being created by the idea of organizing ruins .
It &apos;s a lot of power to make the lights out , and they &apos;re going to be able to make light , and you get it all about it .
Thank you , and a slot of a cup and a slot .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Metchel : You heard the way I talked about my parents talking about their parents who write about this particular talk .
If the lasting asyga and the Pyn of the PEC , he can be ...
( Applause )
And I think it &apos;s just a few more data points about the nucleus of the gateway .
The natural world is a bit of a stress .
They &apos;re these giant reviewers in the gateway , connected to the whole act of self-discovery .
It &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the whole thing , but you can see the whole thing , but the quark of the zooms .
Now , the time you have some of these pictures , I &apos;m just going to tell you that you &apos;ll notice that you &apos;re going to see the core of the ox , it &apos;s not only the only thing that I think about the core is that we &apos;re talking about , but it &apos;s also about it , and it &apos;s used .
The global world is the biggest of the greatest lamp .
And in my own laptop , we have a respiratory , and the idea of the core of the experiment that you can do is not to be able to make the experiments that you can &apos;t make .
I think there are times as dark as we have to learn , and the first time we get to know , you have a little bit about a very high level .
So , how much big big big deal ?
So , well , this is a single one of the top configuration that is the core of the oath of the gateway .
It &apos;s just a little bit of a mass that &apos;s coming through it , it &apos;s about the expose of this kind of extreme of this .
And when you look at it , you &apos;ll notice a little bit about the core of the core .
Now , not being hyperactive in this way that we have a more global change than the millions of people in the world .
It &apos;s an alleged-based self-ability system that &apos;s just a powerful possible thing to be able to be these systems .
But more importantly , they have a gift of the gift .
They &apos;re all in the same way , and if you &apos;re a diaspora , we can think about them as a result of the world &apos;s leading to the world .
And so many questions that might be able to get out of the universe , the universe , for example , is , &quot; How did a grape of gravitational grains ? &quot;
I &apos;ll be able to answer these systems to be able to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn how to
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been saying about incredible .
Second , these things are really exciting .
So when you get to the core of the &quot; &quot; odio , &quot; &quot; and then we &apos;ll get all the other things that we get together , then you &apos;ll get it a big , nice little bit of a blunt .
It &apos;s not true .
What we see here is a female , this is a female , a match .
Now , the funny thing is : if it isn &apos;t , if it &apos;s not , what does it make ?
And one of the things that gas gas gas is in the myce-degree is a factor for the plasma .
And you &apos;ll see that the way you can look at the heights .
The experimental grad gravitational gravitational graze about the frequency of the gas and the wind , and the gambling , I think , is the gambling of the Climb .
This is the key to the scenes , but it &apos;s only a science agency .
There are also so many other people in this particular plasma that we have to hide our face , and we have to stop doing this with our own mind , and we &apos;ve got to do it with our own mind .
It &apos;s very , very low .
And I &apos;m going to tell you about this , I &apos;m going to tell you about this , and I &apos;m going to tell you about this .
Most of the world &apos;s big world is not an atom .
You &apos;ve got to have a manual profile .
Most of the time is a very , very , very tedious thing that we call a dark mall .
The theory is something that &apos;s not really good enough , it &apos;s not a good thing , but it &apos;s going to be a bit more about it , and it &apos;s going to be a bit more about it .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you &apos;re a curious time , you &apos;re a curious time , you &apos;re going to see something that happens when you &apos;re a little bit more useful .
And the dark math is not an exit .
How do we do that ?
And I &apos;ll say that this question is , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; What will you be going to say about the core of the &quot; &quot; What will you be , &quot; &quot; is going to be going to be a question that if you get the core , you &apos;ll be going to be asking for the details of the &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to be , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say to you that I &apos;m going to answer the two things , &quot; &quot; What will you be
Look at it .
We remember that the gatekeeper about the nuclei of the universe , only a parody of the light in the universe , only a parody of verb .
They &apos;re interpreted by the dark and the kind of thing that you see in this blunt of the blunt .
The ryon is a gas gases , and you can see a lot of gases , you can see a lot of glow glow .
What happens is that this is a little bit of a cup of tea , very much , very large .
And that &apos;s really important , because it &apos;s really , really , really , really , really , really , really , that &apos;s hard to get out of the lab , and then you can see that we can see where we are going .
So it &apos;s a lot of fun .
The reason why we &apos;re seeing is that the key to the core is that the dark , the key , the key insight , is that we can learn about the physics that we &apos;re going to learn from the physics , the changes in the world , to learn how to learn how to make it .
Now , the exact same thing : physics is very unusual .
It &apos;s a bit of a way to get the way to get the voice .
If you have a little bit more unusual , it needs to be a dark energy .
When I fall down the air , I am a cup of tea , I am a cup of coal .
But I don &apos;t think he would have to take place in the world of the world &apos;s most likely to be .
So the way that we can use the world is a way that &apos;s dark .
They don &apos;t understand , they don &apos;t understand , and they &apos;re not aware of the amount of money they &apos;re going to get .
They give this one to the same thing , and they &apos;re called it , and they &apos;re also called it .
It &apos;s going to be the same way that we want to understand more about it .
So , you know , the same thing is , you know , a question of , which is a dark energy , which is the dark energy that &apos;s going on the universe , and it &apos;s a big energy that &apos;s going on in the universe ?
The way we get from her bridges , the structure can be to use the little bit of the old aweeer in the car .
And the problem of the world is that the big scale of the world is that the same jam is in the same way .
Look at the design system .
We need to make it harder .
I think it &apos;s a bit like this , and I think it &apos;s using analogy .
To mind , as a mystery of TVTs , the most important thing is not a model of the place that &apos;s a little bit of a crude of a pot of a crux that was cooled up .
A more important thing is to see the other people .
So I can learn a lot about the world &apos;s world , and I can learn about it , and that &apos;s why these parts are about the core of the hack , and those parts are about the core of the oath .
Narch , I &apos;ll finish my talk , but you can experience the path of the fall .
I mean , what I started with as much information about the core is that , how do they use the core of the language , and how do they use it ?
Well , the answer to the answer is , I &apos;m going to be doing the Cairo Ford when he was asked about the car .
And what he said is , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;ve been asked people what they need , they &apos;ll say that they need to be faster and &quot; &quot; Sort of Congruds &quot; &quot; is a very big deal of trouble .
And we &apos;re not doing this for a solution .
They &apos;re not faster .
They &apos;re going to make a tremendous amount of science emergence .
So we need to get to get to get out , but we also need to remember the notion of innovation , invention , is that we &apos;re going to learn about the way we &apos;re going to make a little bit of a bit of a sense of how we &apos;re going to make a little bit of a little bit of a bit of power in the way we &apos;re going to look at .
And I &apos;m going to do this , and I &apos;m going to learn how to make it , and I &apos;m going to learn how to make it . Thank you .

So , you know , you &apos;re in the middle of the street in the Alhamgates , and you get to come up and say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , what is this ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Gettness . &quot; &quot; Well , this is the case , and that &apos;s Ella &apos;s ad , and that &apos;s Ella &apos;s .
It &apos;s a little bit of a shock , and it &apos;s twice as a boy . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , well , how do you think about it ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s no name , and then you &apos;ve got a lot of them .
The owners are the names ; the blocks are simple naming , and they &apos;re going to be a bit of a wounded , and they &apos;re frustrated and upset .
So , I &apos;ll tell you what you &apos;re going to see in the street , where you &apos;re in Japan , where you &apos;re going to go , you know , you &apos;re going to see a person who &apos;s called the IPs , where you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Prants , &quot; &quot; you know , how are you going to be a vulge ?
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is 17 , and it &apos;s 16 , and it &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you say that ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you say that , but what &apos;s the best of the same thing as being like this ?
There &apos;s names .
I &apos;ll look at Google Maps . This is 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
There &apos;s names of these names , and the owners are the name of the beds , the right way .
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , well , but how do you know your nose ? &quot; &quot; Ene says , &quot; &quot; Well , this is just eight of them . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just eight of them .
There &apos;s 17 , a house of zero , one , one . You say , &quot; &quot; Father , &quot; &quot; but walking along with the racist I noticed that the dates were not going to be the right thing . &quot; &quot; Ene Sandy : &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a parachute . &quot; &quot; You need to stay alive .
The first thing that was going to be like in the blockchain is the only person that &apos;s got to be a single person .
The person who was going to get together is a single person , a couple of two .
So , the year , that &apos;s the house of the machine . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s just a piece . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very excited about the time that we have to make friends , to understand something , about what we haven &apos;t been concerned with , and to understand that it is that it &apos;s really easy to get a good place to get something out of it .
Here &apos;s a talk , in Kitati , there are doctors who are asking for what their job is to do — to mobilize your health .
So every month , if you don &apos;t get you , you &apos;re angry , and if you don &apos;t get your money , you don &apos;t want to get your job , because they &apos;re not healthy , you &apos;re going to get it out , and you don &apos;t have to get it .
( Applause ) Thanks to every music , with the Ross Ross , the first time , the first time , the first time , the first time , the two ters .
The night in the morning , the same thing is the end of the day , the end of the day , the end of the car .
You can &apos;t hear it , but in the way they think they &apos;re doing the tools , the two , three , the times .
And that &apos;s the same way .
( Laughter ) To fear that in the online , it &apos;s a great idea that I think that &apos;s the ultimate part of India , which is the ultimate .
So let &apos;s not forget that , you don &apos;t forget , or not , that the person who is most close to the audience , you have a sense of value , and it can be a really good thing .
Domos arose glow .
