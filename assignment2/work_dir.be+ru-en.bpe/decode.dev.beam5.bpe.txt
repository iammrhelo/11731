( Arabic ) I &apos;ve got a joke in Al@@ ta@@ h , which is the name of A@@ th@@ an@@ as , and half of the A@@ th@@ an@@ a@@ va@@ va@@ station .
I was going to sit in my family .
It was five years old , when I was dead , but when I was born , I was born .
There was no difference , but they had to go to school .
I &apos;ll give you a cup of tea .
My mother was born 16 children .
With 16 children , only five people started .
Well , you know , there was a lot of childhood .
The day I saw women who had sex , or kids who had been trained to know .
When I completed my family school , if I ended my family school , I was going to go out of school , and when I ended up in school , when I was reading my family school , when I was reading my family school , if I had completed my family school , if I had completed my family school , if I had completed my family school , if I had completed my family school , if I had completed my family school , if I had completed my family school , when I ended up
I wanted to be the doc@@ tr@@ ine to help women and children .
Now , I ended up school .
I mean , I didn &apos;t have an Internet text@@ book for girls , so I was in a medical doctor , and I didn &apos;t get it .
And my father was one of me in Am@@ ir@@ able .
I moved to the Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ecture .
I made my heart .
I was going to learn from the corner of the corner of the village .
You know , when I sc@@ aled up , I didn &apos;t even know what I was going to share with my family and my whole journey .
Six months old , but I didn &apos;t know .
My family was in refugee camps .
As soon as I finished learning , I moved to my family .
I wanted them to live in the streets .
What was my heart ?
My heart was in Africa .
And when he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to get out of my body , my heart , my heart .
I really wanted to go back to my corner , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I
I was a good job .
I gave a university to learn .
And I went to the refugee camp .
When I went to this camp in P@@ ax@@ istan , I saw 7@@ .@@ 5 million animals , I had 7@@ .@@ 5 million animals .
And 90 percent of them were women and women , and women were going to eat , and you know , when I was in the refugee camp , you know , you know , I was in the refugee camp .
I knew things that when I was interviewed , I knew about things that you can &apos;t imagine .
I saw five and eight kids who sat and cry , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a young woman who was unable to go , didn &apos;t have a sense of education , it wasn &apos;t even a place for a life .
I &apos;ve seen a bunch of boys who have been passionate about their parents and their homes , and they &apos;ve seen a lot of them .
It was a very atro@@ cious system .
And then we have a moment of momentum .
And I asked myself , &quot; &quot; What do I do for these people ? &quot;
How do I help them ?
And I realized that the disability changed my life .
She transformed me , gave me a status .
At that moment , I realized that I had to give you a sense of ownership and health , and so I began to work .
Now , what was the easy lung ?
Well , not because there was a lot of girls on that moment .
And because R@@ ev@@ e@@ i@@ st@@ an was called an Af@@ ghan .
I was going to go out and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Now , I &apos;m going to do that ?
Did you give me ? Nat@@ ur@@ ally .
This is why I &apos;ve got to work trust in this community .
How do I do that ?
I interviewed the questions and a joke , no@@ is@@ y .
I was tor@@ tured .
It was 80 years old .
He was a fly .
I was going to come up with it .
He looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , a woman &apos;s head . How do I hire teachers ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And when I started with my kids , the press began .
We had 25 schools , and 1@@ 5,000 kids who had these schools as they were doing , and that was an astonishing thing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So , we &apos;re working , we do a lot of teachers , we do a lot of teachers right now , and we &apos;re going to give you a little bit of a woman &apos;s right , right ? &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of fri@@ ction .
I was in the office in Pe@@ tr@@ y@@ ward , P@@ ac@@ ou@@ l .
Now , I &apos;ve seen how my clients get to go to the room and get doors to me and tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s hard . &quot; &quot; When you see the men@@ to@@ s , you &apos;re the idea that you &apos;re a product ?
You are hal@@ fway . You know it &apos;s not dangerous .
You know what your life does .
But as a leader , you have to be male .
You &apos;ve got to catch a bridges .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
So I &apos;ve done them .
They went out . They would put them together .
( Laughter ) There are other people .
I brought them together , and I got the har@@ bor harmony .
They said they were not going to write .
Nat@@ ur@@ ally , their tone , the voice , the voice they used to talk to me , is me . I really did .
But I was a lot of my mother .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ?
What are you going to do with this ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them — ( Laughter ) They looked at me in the eyes and said , &quot; &quot; You put it out there . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You put it out there .
We have to give some students some students .
And the Koran says that when you put the Koran in women , ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And they started to talk to the sho@@ e .
And at that moment , I was going to start with my har@@ bor .
Man@@ agement community started moving in .
And 3,000 years old , we started to put out .
There was no way that we could answer .
It was about mother and children .
The third thing is that the third of our health care matters .
We &apos;ve done all three things that you can imagine .
I was happ@@ ily . I was going to get out of my work .
A@@ dd@@ is four-@@ thirds , and I went to the end of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and I went out on the other side of the 19th century .
With the news , they gave us a gift .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that I can tell you .
What do you need ?
And this time we &apos;re going to get it .
And yet , there &apos;s a moment where you have to be a mon@@ etary moment .
You know , there you go .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
With the mom@@ ent@@ ance of rac@@ ism , you &apos;re going to keep the news and do it .
I went and they said to me , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go . &quot; &quot; And I went to the machine , sat in my car , sat down , sat down , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down in the car , sat down ,
In order to help them school , what &apos;s going on in order to answer them , what is more important .
It &apos;s evil to home . No one has ever stopped .
I was only a teenager . I was passionate about a voice .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; What do you have to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
There was hundreds of women in them to get health care .
Now , I &apos;m going to sit down , and I &apos;m a short time — this lady , we talk about , and we talk about this one , and this one is one of my wonderful experiences in my life .
She said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ac@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; I said .
She said , &quot; &quot; This isn &apos;t you . What did you do with it ? &quot;
But this is not a do@@ od@@ le .
You &apos;ll help them . &quot; &quot; And they did .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to check my teachers .
Today , these are the tools that are the best .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s about what the human behavior changes .
When you learn people , if you &apos;re teaching people , if you &apos;re teaching people .
( Laughter ) Women have been working .
I &apos;m sure ...
I live in the edges , which was a good thing and a good thing .
I want to share with you .
That was the end of the landscape .
We could be able to do it .
You know what ?
Today , people can &apos;t get out of the house without having a cl@@ apping .
But we want to go back to the end of Africa .
They &apos;re going to get a lot , and they &apos;re learning what they &apos;re doing .
So , you &apos;ll see it going to work .
I want to share with you a little bit of this .
I said that I think that compassion and self can make light .
S@@ her@@ d Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ecture : Why are you guys ?
K@@ H : H@@ mm , let &apos;s see a look .
C@@ er@@ ver : P@@ ari@@ sian pu@@ ri@@ fied rap of the world , pat@@ ched out the best car data , the h@@ alls of the C@@ D@@ C , the pe@@ ti@@ tion of the invas@@ ion , the twe@@ e@@ ts of the invas@@ i@@ ant pat@@ ents , and the sa@@ dness of the le@@ af@@ lets .
K@@ H : Well , I , when the L@@ HC , in the middle of an out@@ sider , is the best way to write .
C@@ er@@ ver : Where are you in the garden ?
We have an average high blood pressure .
K@@ H : Well , let &apos;s get a resp@@ ir@@ atory zone , a squ@@ are@@ -@@ lad@@ der .
Number two : H@@ old on .
I &apos;m going to give you a big job .
( Applause ) Mother P@@ ang : I &apos;m a couple of years old , how do you train an al@@ ign@@ ment in my own hand , and I &apos;m a lot of anima@@ tions in my t@@ ec@@ ton@@ ics in my 20s .
And I also knew that I was going to know that the same auth@@ ors .
The t@@ elec@@ om@@ muni@@ cations industry was execu@@ ted to the work of education that most kids don &apos;t know .
When I realized that auth@@ ors are the ones that are cartoons that I &apos;m going to leave you on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to make an architect ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;m going to be an Eng@@ li@@ sh@@ ire , and I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;m going , but it was a big deal of fear of my life .
It &apos;s an initi@@ a@@ tives , and artists have always been in love .
But by the time , the computer technology has led to the idea of self-@@ discovery , &quot; &quot; The Gol@@ den De@@ pression . &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Mag@@ ic D@@ iz@@ es &quot; &quot; ) ( &quot; &quot; Mag@@ ic D@@ iz@@ es &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) I started with my computers , I was trying to see it , and I thought , what if there was a little bit of light on my little sister ?
Can there have a lot of machines where they &apos;re struggling to build ?
So we were born with &quot; &quot; Sel@@ f-@@ Organ@@ ized &quot; &quot; .
When I was four years old , tat@@ to@@ os told me how to put computers on the side and school .
Now , I have come from this journey of a book technology technology .
I was going to go on to H@@ T@@ M@@ M@@ L , and I &apos;m going to teach you about Ja@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt and P@@ y@@ ton .
And I also think that I &apos;m also a new mindset , I think , &quot; &quot; The Ex@@ peri@@ ents . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s talking about bees and other things that they have , and they &apos;re using .
If the flowers don &apos;t pollin@@ ate these things , then all of the bi@@ ases , you know , we &apos;re going to get out of the road .
So I decided to use these files , and do they use the super@@ hero to the super@@ hero .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ) ( R@@ inging ) An@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ er : It &apos;s still .
It &apos;s going to be a bit of an experience .
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) With my own initi@@ a@@ tives .
The idea is able to get a ru@@ b .
I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally , it &apos;s a lot of work and new jobs .
Thanks to the idea of the female , the idea is the whole thing .
If we don &apos;t , we wouldn &apos;t be there , we wouldn &apos;t be there , we wouldn &apos;t be the technology , whether or not there was technology , but it wasn &apos;t going to be a culture , it would have a lot of sense of it .
When I was eight years old , I took my whole idea and opened up a Big Ma@@ o , and I was going to turn out to the idea of Mother &apos;s ideas .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to grow an ech@@ o@@ ly warri@@ or and ac@@ cess@@ ories .
I am 13 , and I don &apos;t even know that I started from 2008 , 2008 , and I &apos;m not going to start with my career .
And the numbers came up for me , and I wanted to support him , and I wanted it to help my friends I sla@@ ve , putting it down , putting it down .
I mean , you know , a lot of colle@@ ges in my nose , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , you can do a bag or a little girl — I &apos;ve had a little idea for the first time .
And I noticed that when I was in my mind , I would argue that when I was in my mind , I would say , &quot; &quot; How are you going to write ? &quot;
And I thought , well , you can do a truth and open up a physics .
I was only eight years old , private plans for physics .
I only knew that I wanted to learn how to learn how to make sense of faith , and what I wanted to share with you , I &apos;d like to share with you a little bit about my life .
My mother taught me to carry on , and I was going to look after the char@@ ges , and I was going to go on my way , and I was going to write a lot of names on the side of my head .
I started to make more raised more grown , like ballo@@ ons and ballo@@ ons .
The worst of my mother would start to take a whole world , and I had a lot of C@@ D@@ V@@ s in the United States , California , Canada and other parts .
I mean , I have a lot to learn about leadership , as a matter of fact , for example , and sell it , and then we sell the answers to them , and then give them a little bit of a gri@@ p .
The case of physics started out .
And one day I was 10 years old , with F@@ ore@@ ign F@@ orest .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me , and I think I had a physicist in my own .
A lot of people ask me , why do I think I will ?
With a little bit of a sense of view , I think it &apos;s a lot of sense of view and threats that live in them .
Now , the parents of parents taught me to share with you , in terms of the way , in the way that you have a little bit of money , and you have to take care of all of them .
And I found out what I &apos;d like to think about , whether or not , in terms of people , in terms of people and the world , and I started reading and I knew that even after the heart of the world , I found that even after the heart of the world , I was going to do it with stuff .
With the process of discovery , we have a range of me@@ als , or of course , with the calcul@@ ations .
It &apos;s frozen by wind , and it &apos;s also a lot of people who have their breath .
And so when I started with a firm , I knew two things : all of my things would have to be ec@@ o@@ logically ec@@ li@@ cal , and that 10 percent of may@@ ors were going to get the meat and the super@@ intelligent army .
( Applause ) I think of myself as part of the new people who are not only going to do money to make money , but also to conf@@ use the world .
I believe that I &apos;m going to give them a lot of money , and I believe that I &apos;m going to give them a sense of future generations .
We live in a big way , and we live in a big way , and then we &apos;ll have a better way to judge it .
P@@ art of what happens in the universe just by the way , and the idea is not enough .
It &apos;s all about the heart of the heart , because it creates the idea of organizing ru@@ ins .
It &apos;s a little bit of courage and finding out the lights , and it &apos;s going to make sense .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) P@@ at M@@ et@@ ch@@ el : You &apos;ve heard about how I talked about my parents talking about their parents who write about it .
If the la@@ kes , the sp@@ id@@ er and the P@@ y@@ n of P@@ ong , can you .
( Applause )
There &apos;s a little bit of insight about the nucle@@ us .
It &apos;s a bit of a stress challenge .
They &apos;re these giant re@@ vie@@ wers in the g@@ ate@@ way , connected to the whole environment .
Most of the rab@@ bits that you see on the screen are not only the only stars , but the quar@@ l@@ l@@ ec@@ tus .
But once you &apos;ve got some of these , you know , I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what you &apos;ll see , that you &apos;ll notice that the nucle@@ us are not only going to do it , but that &apos;s not only that , I think about the core of the mystery , is that they &apos;re going to talk about , and they &apos;re used .
It &apos;s like the roof@@ s of the greatest fin@@ ite light in the world .
And in my own ro@@ om@@ mate , there was an anti@@ depres@@ s@@ er about the core of the experiment that you can manufac@@ ture on .
Well , I think there &apos;s a lot of stroke there , and it &apos;s the first time that we need to know , and the first time we want to know , it &apos;s a very short time .
Now , how much big big grand ?
Right , this is the answer to the bottom of the nucle@@ us .
It &apos;s just a little bit more powerful than it is , and it comes out of it , is that it comes beyond the extre@@ m@@ ity of this .
And when you look at it , you &apos;ll notice that the whole thing is going to see the circle around the nucle@@ us .
It &apos;s not going to be the way that we can &apos;t be hyper@@ active in terms of millions of people .
This is an al@@ le@@ it@@ ating , cum@@ ul@@ ative thing to be able to be these systems .
But more importantly , they have access to individual identity .
They &apos;re at all the same time , and when you give you a di@@ as@@ por@@ a , we can think about them as we think about per@@ cep@@ tual ver@@ bs .
And there &apos;s a lot of questions that are going on with us , and there &apos;s a lot of questions that we have , for example , about , &quot; How do you play gi@@ gan@@ tic ? &quot;
And you &apos;ll be able to answer these systems .
So , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about .
Second , these things are really exciting .
So if you &apos;re going to look at the core of the nucle@@ us , and then keep all the links out there , then you &apos;ll get it a big , no@@ is@@ y sne@@ a@@ ker .
It &apos;s not true .
Now , what we see here is a female , it &apos;s actually a match of light .
Now , the funny thing is , if it isn &apos;t , if it isn &apos;t , is that it &apos;s not true ?
And it &apos;s going to be a gas gas gas gas gas , it &apos;s a bit more likely to be a plas@@ ma .
And the reason is that you can look at the paper .
Now , the Ex@@ tro@@ venti@@ l@@ ation of this system is that the frequency of a law@@ suit , and it &apos;s going to give them a gam@@ bling , and it &apos;s a gam@@ bling plate , and it &apos;s a gam@@ bling factor .
This is what &apos;s the core of the scenes , but it &apos;s only by science .
There &apos;s also a lot of other people in this particular plas@@ ma that &apos;s still a good thing for us , and that we &apos;ve done it , and we &apos;ve got to make it happen , and we &apos;ve got to get it out of our mind .
Tre@@ es are very low .
I &apos;m going to tell you about this , and I &apos;m going to tell you about this .
Most of the world &apos;s small@@ -@@ scale was not done .
You &apos;ve got it .
Most of it is a little bit more likely to have a sense of purpose .
The theory is something that &apos;s not really good enough , it &apos;s not really good enough , and it &apos;s not going to be able to know about it .
If you &apos;re a particle physicist , you &apos;re an interesting thing that happens when we eat something that happens .
And the dark math is not an exception .
Now , how can we do that ?
To answer this question , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; What will you be going to say about the &quot; &quot; What is going to be , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; What will you be going to get on ? &quot;
Look at it .
And we remember that we remember that the core of the universe is the universe , just a par@@ ody of power .
They &apos;re interpre@@ ted from the dark , and it &apos;s something that you can see in this kind of bl@@ unt .
The r@@ y@@ on is a gas garage , and you can see a lot of gases .
Now , what happens is that this is a par@@ all@@ a@@ ire of a cup of tea , a very large way .
And that &apos;s really important , because it means that it &apos;s very , very , very , very little , that it &apos;s hard to get out of the lab , and you can see that we can see where we &apos;re going .
So it &apos;s really fun .
Now , when you think about the core , we can learn about what &apos;s going on in terms of the dark , and that &apos;s why we can learn about what &apos;s going on in terms of a very low way , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re like , that they &apos;re just about to learn about it .
P@@ art : It &apos;s very unusual .
It &apos;s a bit of the way that it &apos;s really going to turn around .
If you have a little bit more unusual , it needs to be dark energy .
When I drop the balloon in wind , I am a cup of tea .
But I don &apos;t think he &apos;s going to be going to have a lot of money in the world , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a lot of money .
And so , the way that we see the dark light is the time .
They don &apos;t understand , they don &apos;t understand , they don &apos;t understand .
They give it a little bit of this , and they &apos;re called it .
We want to learn more about it .
So , you know , it &apos;s an ad@@ verse question , which is a little bit more ener@@ ge@@ tic , which is the dark energy in the universe ?
It &apos;s going to have a little bit from her mot@@ ors , the structure of the bridge , the structure of the day .
And the problem of Uni@@ ver@@ sal in the big scale is that that &apos;s the same thing that we have .
Look at the design system .
We need to do it .
I &apos;m thinking about it , using analogy .
Now , as a matter of fact , Ty@@ ler was the most important thing — this is not a model of a place where a little bit of cru@@ el@@ ty is the cru@@ x of the man@@ ual , which was cool@@ ed .
A more important thing is to see a lot of people .
So I &apos;m going to learn a lot about the world in the first place , and I &apos;m going to learn about it , and that &apos;s what the frequ@@ encies are .
N@@ ar@@ ch , I &apos;ll finish my talk , but you can also experience myself more slowly .
I mean , I &apos;m going to start with how much useful information about the nucle@@ i , and how do they use it ?
Well , that &apos;s the way I want to fix the Ford Ford when he was asked about the car .
And what he said is , &quot; &quot; If I asked people what they need , they would say , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;ve been tor@@ tured to people what they need , &quot; &quot; the power of society is a very large number of problems .
And it &apos;s not like that .
They &apos;re not faster .
They &apos;re going to have an astonishing number of science invention .
So , we need to get out of it , and we need to remember that we need to remember the notion of innovation , but we also need to remember that we need to remember the notion of how we &apos;re going to make a little bit of a sense of how we &apos;re going to make a little bit of a little bit of the power in terms of how we &apos;re moving .
And to me , the best way to do this is to learn from the lights . Thank you .
( Applause )
So , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re in the middle of the sky in the Al@@ bu@@ ms , and you come back to you and say , &quot; &quot; Hu@@ g , &quot; &quot; you know , how does this block ?
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ll see it . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to be a post@@ script , and that &apos;s E@@ lla .
It &apos;s a little bit of shock , and it &apos;s twice . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; you know , there &apos;s no name on this block ? &quot; &quot; And you said , &quot; &quot; You know , there aren &apos;t you .
They have names of the names ; blo@@ gs are simple be@@ ats . &quot; &quot; He walks , three and w@@ ins .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you what you &apos;re going to see on the street , where you &apos;re in Japan , where you &apos;re going to go , and you say , &quot; &quot; P@@ ran@@ ts , &quot; &quot; you know , how are you going ?
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is 17 , and it &apos;s 16 , and it &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , how are you going to say this ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , how are you going to say that ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ve got no name .
There &apos;s names .
This is a look at Google M@@ aps . This is 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
There are names of these names , and they &apos;re the name , and they are simple nam@@ ing .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , good , but how do you know your nose ? &quot; &quot; E@@ ne says , &quot; &quot; Well , this is just eight of them .
There &apos;s a block of 17 , a house of zero . You say , &quot; &quot; Fa@@ ther . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Fa@@ ther , &quot; &quot; I noticed that in the ladies , I noticed that there was no problem . &quot; &quot; E@@ ne says , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a parachu@@ te . You need to stay alive .
Now , I bet you had to have a single person in front of a block .
Well , you know , I &apos;m going to give you a good friend — a couple of two .
It &apos;s a house of a house . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s simple . &quot; &quot; Now , I &apos;m very excited about the time that we have to make friend@@ ships , to understand something , about what we haven &apos;t seen before , and to understand that it is that it &apos;s really easy to make sense of stress .
Here &apos;s an example , in Ki@@ ta@@ i , there are a gi@@ fts that their work — to make sure that their job is to get your health .
So every month , if you don &apos;t get you , you &apos;re angry , and if you don &apos;t raise your money , you don &apos;t want to get your job , because they don &apos;t give you a good job .

An@@ n@@ as@@ ic music , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the end of the day of the day of the cli@@ ffs .
Now , you can &apos;t hear it , but in the way they don &apos;t think it &apos;s the way they think of the music , two , three , times .
And that &apos;s also true .
( Laughter ) To fear that , in the past , it &apos;s going to talk about India , there &apos;s a super@@ no@@ vation that is also true .
So let &apos;s not forget that , you don &apos;t forget , whether you &apos;re in TED or something else that &apos;s not going to give you a good idea , but it can also be true .
D@@ om@@ os ar@@ ig@@ enti@@ ously .
