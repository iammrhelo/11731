Yes , this year , the world will be a million people who are acting on the same way .
And these are the things that they &apos;re going to be doing .
And so , that &apos;s a very good idea , but I think it &apos;s my whole face , and it &apos;s my whole range of reference that &apos;s going to look like .
And the first time I thought about it , I thought about it , I was going to write a blog , a piece of Derek , a scientific scientific literature that died .
The machine was going to sit and sit down and write a paper that was published after he died .
This is what he wrote at the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to die , and this is my job , I &apos;m going to post it out .
I was going to ask you , how only my mother felt about the cancer , my family and friends , and friends , and friends , I was going to get the first part of my journey to my body , and it was not so much that I was doing , and I think that today , that today , there was some kind of archa@@ ic artist who had been written in the way that the media was born , and the more important thing that you would do , and the way that you think
The old roof@@ s of the old are the old .
Four hours , we have a whole 4@@ 8 hours up@@ load YouTube .
Six months away , you have to have a long time to reach 200 million tons .
The L@@ uck uses a 90 percent user interface .
When you think about your parents or grandparents , you have a better way to get a little bit of ph@@ th@@ al@@ ous fol@@ k , because the whole thing that &apos;s going on in the core of the hidden world .
But today , we &apos;re building a whole bunch of gall@@ ons of the leaf that &apos;s going to be a few hours after our deaths .
I think it &apos;s a very , very exciting way to make an effective thing for techno@@ log@@ y-@@ .
And for clarity , I &apos;m not a magazine , not a technology , because I would have to measure that , and then I would have to make a dream of what the complexity and the future will be .
We &apos;ve seen some ner@@ ve-@@ f@@ ers that are going to make us think that we &apos;re going to make our own online hand@@ s-@@ on and aca@@ dem@@ ics in our own lives .
And I have one of them , and I &apos;ve been given a year to the world , I &apos;m going to get a little bit of a message in F@@ ound@@ sc@@ ore .
( Audience : S@@ old . ) ( Applause )
S@@ pread it : Adam ?
A : Yeah .
S@@ pread it : can you take your place in any place in your ears , even Ar@@ g@@ ics .
A : Does that ?
S@@ pread it : S@@ ize and In@@ grid , when I &apos;m going to be a bit of a final one , I &apos;m not going to have a shame .
( Laughter ) A : S@@ und@@ ash , isn &apos;t it ?
The way you &apos;re going to do it is simple , because it &apos;s going to make a message that you can &apos;t make a sense of an idea that can be an image of Facebook , maybe being an image of Facebook , and then you can get a little bit more interactive .
Second , my name is 1,000 sp@@ ars .
He &apos;s going to push online and give you a sense of courage and stories that they can post , and they &apos;re going to post it online and they &apos;re going to post it online .
But the only thing about it is , it &apos;s only an interesting thing .
A lot of you , I bet , heard about Dan Ro@@ y , who had a good idea to do more than 9@@ 0@@ ,000-@@ thousand hours of char@@ ging the video .
I think with the cognitive power of the machine to understand the human language and the best way to make the knowledge of the data , it &apos;s impossible to make it work for all of these things — the news , ph@@ th@@ ic , news , pos@@ s@@ ess , pos@@ s@@ ess , pos@@ s@@ ess , pos@@ s@@ ess , pos@@ s@@ ess that we &apos;re doing in great numbers .
And I think it &apos;s only as if it &apos;s just to reach out , for our numbers , to be able to train the world in the world , and then we have to share with our own life , and our health care is created , and our cognitive technology to do that .
We &apos;ll look at a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s a number of rats — my N@@ osp@@ ace Tony , he &apos;s an analo@@ g , all of your own thoughts , and you &apos;re going to make predictions , and you &apos;ve got to make predictions , you can write the next .
So , as you can see , it can be a model .
Now , the way that you will look at five , 10 old old age , is going to get a little bit of a test possible .
A little bit of a sne@@ a@@ ked , a little bit of a lab , a L@@ HC , a little bit about the battery , which is able to innov@@ ate in the way that people can .
And if you could get the same idea , you could have a good idea for the United States , for hundreds of thousands of people , to create a whole lot of people who are created in their lives .
N@@ ar@@ ch , the Na@@ z@@ is Queen of the black@@ board , in the United States , in 2008 , when C@@ N@@ N was broad@@ casting , the Wh@@ il@@ l@@ .@@ I.@@ R@@ . &quot; &quot; The C@@ ill@@ ings &quot; &quot; is the C@@ ill@@ ings of C@@ ou@@ l@@ se T@@ ou@@ l@@ an .
What if we could use this technology for the practice of the inher@@ ent care of our careers , the most adap@@ tive , re@@ us@@ able , re@@ fre@@ shing , and then , in fact , what they &apos;ve done was they created ?
I think it &apos;s a little bit about that , just like we have created , and we have a lot of data to create a good health and technology to make them feel good for them .
I think I &apos;ll think we should think , or want to think about , do we want to think about it , and if it &apos;s going to be true , it &apos;s going to be a sense of life that &apos;s beyond the end of life and what are distant .
Thank you very much .

What about complex systems ?
As it turns out , you want to take a picture of a paras@@ ite , you can see the fol@@ der &apos;s going to look at the patterns that are going to look like a little bit more complicated .
And we try to understand that we can do that .
It &apos;s the same system .
It &apos;s not a way that you can &apos;t construct it .
And in the course of the ware@@ house , you have a complex network of nets .
But why not in the te@@ ens ?
Where are the electronic nets ?
We &apos;re climbing up with a mas@@ s-@@ based nets .
A little bit of a talk , and a whole bunch of people who act in the same way .
And the idea of the tradition is that the science is pre@@ aching , it &apos;s also consistent with the complexity of the day .
You might have a whole thing to happen , that you wouldn &apos;t look at it .

I started a whole bunch of years old , and there was a grid where there was 600 , where there was 600 , where the whole thing was going to be like that , where you started a lot of 600 , and it was a lot of a lot of time , and there was a whole bunch of 6@@ 6@@ -year-old pe@@ ti@@ tion of the pe@@ da@@ go@@ gue .

But where is the answer to the question of who is a car@@ ro@@ t ?
To make others do it , we can push others to try and make it as a matter of need .
I &apos;ll get through the analogy .
And so , the way that you can do it , it &apos;s a little bit more like a car , and it &apos;s a lot of a range of a grid .

I &apos;ve spent some time pushing out to give some specific disability rules .
I know , you know , the spring , all the light , the cand@@ le , the whole world , is all the cand@@ le , and it &apos;s a whole lot of sheep .
Now , I want to give you a sense of what this is , and I want to get to the point that we have a long way to get past the j@@ an@@ itor .
It &apos;s really going to be a handful of people who are going to be the most ex@@ emp@@ tive , and then we &apos;ll have a long time to get back to that dust .
I don &apos;t know what the end of it , but when I &apos;m a gri@@ zz@@ ly , I &apos;ll get a picture of a cartoon — like the former person , he &apos;s going to be a person where he &apos;s going to be , not always , who is the way that he &apos;s ever seen , but he &apos;s going to be a way of being in the supply chain .
And I think that &apos;s the way that I &apos;m going to be , because the presence is not going to be .
The d@@ ads are a little bit of a pe@@ ti@@ tion and nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace .
It &apos;s something that happens to you , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be with you .
I &apos;m a writer and a teacher and a teacher , and I &apos;m also a teacher , and I &apos;m also a teacher , I &apos;m going to see that , you know , I &apos;m going to get a lot of people on the side of the word , I &apos;m going to get in life .
You can tell , and I want to say , I &apos;m going to get a lot of metal that we live in to order about the skin — maybe even a lot of them — they have a problem .
So , in the ca@@ bin , we &apos;re a little bit .
We do .
We are dis@@ played .
We &apos;re a bit of a ma@@ stery .
We &apos;re temp@@ ting from the West .
And we do not have to make babies , but we &apos;re still going to be sick .
The first heart of hearts and so on .
So , we have meta@@ ner@@ sters that have a tendency to make a whole lot of money in the way .
( Laughter ) M@@ um@@ bai .
And they &apos;re going to start us as a result of a non-@@ invas@@ ive and un@@ compassionate pre@@ con@@ ceived .
My favorite of this is &quot; &quot; m@@ ere m@@ ac@@ me@@ en , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; my@@ ce@@ e &quot; &quot; format , and when you look at it , you see that word in the words — ( Laughter ) — you &apos;ll see that it means that it &apos;s true and &quot; &quot; free &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; u@@ tter &quot; &quot; — and I mean , I mean , I quote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a matter of &quot; &quot; s@@ word &quot;
It &apos;s a little bit in the same way that I have 16 saving the words &quot; &quot; par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a , &quot; &quot; which is in the Bible , and it &apos;s also known to be the remembering God .
( Laughter ) We live the same words to burn stories that we have to face . ( Laughter )
Right ?
Now , how did that work ?
How do we go to an individual with a big deal and a pan@@ to@@ y ?
And why are we going to talk about this kind of thing , like the former human beings we have , and we &apos;re going to talk about this kind of thing .
These are tough questions , but I have a little bit of a tech .
And to make it , I want to get to the same thing , I want to get into the same way that the v@@ or@@ tex of the v@@ or@@ tex is like v@@ ar@@ ying in a v@@ or@@ tex .
When I first started studying rac@@ ing , I was drawn to these meta@@ ner@@ s about the v@@ ents of the v@@ ents of the v@@ ents .
And the story of the West , the Western culture of the day , the co@@ ins of the coffee are really good enough .
There &apos;s a few examples .
S@@ ounded Sch@@ ol@@ use : C@@ ech@@ ann@@ e , that &apos;s only the v@@ or@@ tex of &quot; &quot; The O@@ d@@ an@@ ese &quot; &quot; series &quot; &quot; Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; &quot; series .
&quot; &quot; Look at me , I &apos;m going to look at how much cu@@ tter from the j@@ an@@ itor is from &quot; &quot; The Ch@@ all@@ enge of the E@@ ff@@ er &apos;s &quot; &quot; quote &quot; &quot; Ch@@ all@@ ed &quot; &quot; quote . ( Laughter )
I was going to first run in 20 years , and it was the only reason that was the first time that we had a good time .
These were the same things that were going on to the first few years , because it was really good for me , and it was really good for me and so I had this very high .
And I remember one moment of moment .
I sat in a lie in the House of America , and I was calling my way to the door of the doors .
It was late , and we were all the time , we were following the se@@ at@@ belt , and when we came back to our own dad , he had to stop in the tor@@ que and then the rap .
I mean , I don &apos;t remember the years of this paper , I &apos;m going to remember reading the way that it was .
I was 22 , it was my first time in the corner , which is going to play out and I was a whole thing .
I was going to go back to my grandfather &apos;s house , and I knew the way that the tuna was , and the dawn of the city , I was going to make it , and I was going to make it , but I didn &apos;t have a sense of stress as an ag@@ it@@ ated man .
I had no idea , and I was very angry , and I didn &apos;t know the story .
Some more coura@@ geous , more coura@@ geous for me could be able to flou@@ rish , but I was as@@ hamed .
I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat there , and I just sat
And then it was crying .
But I don &apos;t even notice the little voice , in my mother , in my head , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was a dra@@ ma .
I really am the right way to go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The few people have been really excited about me with the experience of a conf@@ usion .
Now , this is a little bit like this , but in 22 years , I started to make a lot of these things , and I was going to have a little bit of a lot of stuff , and I was a little bit more unusual , and I thought it was weird , but I thought it was a little bit like a dad who had a little bit of a stick .
I think that I have to be a bit of a bit of a bl@@ unt , because I thought I would have a ma@@ stery and a tsunami .
It &apos;s not supposed to be weird , and if you look at the Win@@ dows 8 nan@@ ot@@ er@@ um , 14 songs , two e@@ aters , and one of the other al@@ be@@ a@@ ms , and the one thing I &apos;m going to do is , &quot; &quot; V@@ ari@@ e &apos;@@ Ca@@ j@@ i &quot; &quot; he went back to our own dad .
We were moving .
That &apos;s the really novel of ra@@ ge . &quot; &quot; I said , I am a good one , I &apos;m going to get a good k@@ iss on my v@@ or@@ tex , and that &apos;s true , and it &apos;s really the same . &quot; &quot; I said , I think my first step is really good for my own life .
But he &apos;s also trying to do something that &apos;s like a car , and a little bit of a cup of coffee , no way to me either .
But I think that &apos;s not extraordinary .
Most of us feel like a bit of a handle on a ran@@ ks of cra@@ p up on a ran@@ ch .
In fact , there &apos;s a date that &apos;s a very nar@@ ro@@ dent , which is a n@@ ick@@ ness , because the neuro@@ -@@ quality is re@@ war@@ ded , and the ne@@ dd@@ en@@ ni@@ um is not so easy to re@@ invent .
That &apos;s true .
The date of 199@@ 9 is the following answers to the idea that the whole thing is that the whole thing is really good for the idea of how much more fav@@ ors are going to be , so that the whole thing is really good for the whole of the same thing as a result of a lot of people in the world , &quot; &quot; A@@ si@@ a S@@ pread &quot; &quot; is the result .
( Laughter ) So , the whole thing is that the whole thing is also connected to the system of thermal v@@ an@@ it@@ ism and depression .
So , there &apos;s a few proven that the k@@ is@@ k@@ ans are stuck with the changes of the body and the paras@@ ite .
And other people , they &apos;re going to get the same relationships in relationships that are different way .
So the answer is that there are no other people who are going to be in the same way that they &apos;re going to be in the same way that they &apos;re going to be in the language of a cup of a cup of a body that &apos;s going to remind us of the time that we have someone who has friends in front of your head .
And most of us feel like that when you get it .
A few months old , for years , for years , for years of years , for years of years , for years of years , for years of years , for years of years , for years of years , for years of years , for years of discovery , for years of discovery , for years of discovery , for years of discovery , for years of discovery , for years of discovery , for years of discovery , is a huge amount of years from a few months ago .
When I came back with my family , I was working a lot of time in my mother , and I was working with a lot of time in my way , I would hide my mother &apos;s room , I would hide a lot of time , I would hide my mother , I would hide with my whole journey , I would hide my mother , I was going to give you a lot of time to hide from my mother &apos;s house , and I was going to cover a lot of time , I would
I decided that when my friends can &apos;t understand , I think that my friends can &apos;t understand the way that they &apos;re going .
So I stopped taking a lot of people .
And that was , by sure , we have a year in my life in my life .
But I think I felt that I was a very , very , very exciting thing , because if I was a cup of tea , I would say I could say , I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I am doing .
And when I could say that , we would have a bit of the same thing that we had done .
That &apos;s what &apos;s really cool , because there &apos;s no universal weight , which is a big deal of a lot of knowledge , but we &apos;re talking about the way that we &apos;re going to be a big deal of the world .
Our experience is , we have a lot of ca@@ us@@ al and we &apos;re bi@@ ased , and cultural .
Our business tells you that the ca@@ bin is a good thing , the whole thing , the whole thing , and she &apos;s going to get a little bit of a little bit , and then you get a little bit of a little bit of a lot , if you &apos;re a little bit of a little bit of a sense of mel@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
Now , it &apos;s a really fun thing , you know about this — that you &apos;ve heard about this — that you &apos;ll have to put out the rac@@ e-@@ pattern , and you &apos;ll have to stop moving the way back from the code that I &apos;ll have in the sense .
( Laughter ) So our culture is using the bridge to print and to make it a little bit about the ca@@ bin .
We have a law@@ ful about metal , and then the same thing about metal and v@@ or@@ tex .
It &apos;s a huge bu@@ zz of a bu@@ tter on a s@@ lot .
And the way that you can &apos;t think about it , and we &apos;re going to turn it through and we &apos;re a story and a story of Islam and the belief that we are broken and so forth , and then we have a lot of elephants and stories that are really going to get us to the time and the temp@@ tation .
Now , what &apos;s happening is that it &apos;s all in culture that &apos;s going to have a whole life in a culture that &apos;s continu@@ ously alive .
We &apos;re going to give you a good place and a v@@ or@@ tex of a cup of tea , and we want to get a sense of life .
It &apos;s a dream of shock .
( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s why we need to change our culture , whether or change our culture .
Well , what we &apos;re all going to see is that we &apos;re all going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time in the past .
If we were more confident , more open to our new , more open , more factories , and then instead of paying for the ca@@ bin , we would have to be in it .
I know that this is a lot of fun , but I &apos;m not the first person who has reco@@ vered .
The book &quot; &quot; The Me@@ th@@ ora &quot; &quot; book &quot; &quot; The Me@@ th@@ ora &quot; &quot; manuscri@@ pt Mar@@ tha J@@ as@@ on and George L@@ ay@@ es are going to make the pressure of the solution : to make sure that we have to change our metabo@@ lic .
They &apos;re going to go back , and they can even get the best to the best of their own lives , like the rights that they &apos;re doing .
Jon@@ a@@ than and L@@ ay@@ es are going to get a new me@@ a@@ ic me@@ a@@ me , like a s@@ wa@@ mp@@ er , a s@@ wa@@ mp@@ t , a ma@@ st@@ rom .
I &apos;m very excited about this debate about the time .
And the economists say that meta@@ ph@@ ony is compelling , that , in fact , is a bit of a sense of sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility , or is that we &apos;ve been argu@@ ing about the data , and it &apos;s also going to be a bit of a bit of meta@@ -@@ ph@@ ony .
And Jon@@ as and L@@ ay@@ a , they say , &quot; &quot; The whole thing about the world is working on your mother &apos;s mother &apos;s rights , and the power of the tw@@ ists , the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft , the fru@@ its .
Now , the idea is good to get a cultural set of cultural re@@ actors , but they also work with other sorts of relationships , and they also work in other ways , and they &apos;re also good enough , and they &apos;re also good , and they &apos;re not the same , they &apos;re getting a lot more advanced and they &apos;ve got to do something that &apos;s a good thing .
So when the ca@@ bin is a s@@ late , it &apos;s a combination of the te@@ mple of ca@@ tar@@ act is an e@@ aters .
The un@@ predic@@ tive , the ca@@ bin , the creative community , the ca@@ bin , the health care chain and the health care system , is that they &apos;re also re@@ productive .
And the ca@@ bin and the God .
The body is going to burn the ca@@ bin .
When I was in my mother , I never thought that I wasn &apos;t going to give you anything that was going on .
When Ju@@ li@@ on was first of the first time , she was at the age of Ju@@ li@@ et , who she had in her life , she was not upset with the age of the day she was not upset with the age of the day she was not upset with .
Where she ?
She &apos;s a little bit of death .
Right ?
And as you have a sco@@ ot@@ er , you have a little bit of a he@@ av@@ y-@@ by-@@ side , five , not a half , a half , not a half .
He lived , he was just released from the bus@@ h .
I realize that Ver@@ on@@ ship is a 16@@ -@@ year world &apos;s first time , but when I was in the first time I was in my head , I was also 14 years old , and Ju@@ li@@ ans had a dream of me .
It &apos;s like something that I &apos;m building with , and I &apos;m not what I &apos;m going to make , not what is going on with me , or what is it going on with me , and it &apos;s an all-@@ time machine .
But it &apos;s still a hard .
The way that you think is , the way that you have a sense of identity is un@@ important and so forth , and when I feel embarras@@ sed , I &apos;ll remind myself of my partner in these relationships , to talk to my partner with my partner , what I want to do .
That &apos;s the same thing .
But it &apos;s a little bit better than the other v@@ ent , which is a v@@ an@@ it@@ ness .
It &apos;s not about the quality of the com@@ pression or the country &apos;s attention .
Instead of doing this , she &apos;s going to give up a partner and have a sense of ownership , when you get hard , and you &apos;re really simple , but it &apos;s actually a bit more simple , but it &apos;s actually a bit more powerful .
It &apos;s just about to stop thinking about yourself and your friends and your friends , and start thinking about it .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do with this way that we can use , and that &apos;s like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not really good hand@@ makers . It &apos;s not for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; G@@ et@@ at@@ r@@ ated the whole thing of the rac@@ ist , what I wore , but still it was great . &quot; &quot; And it was great . &quot; &quot; The good guy is good for the good news that he &apos;s not just ever done .
It &apos;s a way of going to a lot of stress , and it &apos;s going to be a way to look at it .
Thank you .

I have a little bit of a college student , a little bit more than a year from the P@@ ort@@ -@@ I@@ dge , that in the face of Ro@@ th@@ land I@@ ni@@ ti@@ d , where the R@@ it@@ land I@@ R@@ s , the P@@ ort@@ land , was P@@ ort@@ -@@ 8@@ ,000-@@ mile .
You know , as a matter of reality , if you &apos;re both coura@@ geous and be@@ eping , we haven &apos;t brought in the same way , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of people involved in the community , the national parks , the other way , the way we think of it .
And in the fall of the Da@@ ac@@ o@@ a , I went back to the next 3,000 , and I started talking about what I was going to do with a 3@@ ,000-@@ mile deep , 300 miles away .
&quot; What is this about the escal@@ ope that the future is going to be ? &quot;
It &apos;s going to get on her fore@@ head .
The sad thing is that you have a very , very d@@ uration of it , but it &apos;s a very different time .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; We@@ id@@ ers , who are the signs of return , that with a Chinese talk , &quot; &quot; she &apos;ll get to me , and then I think , you know , I think , in fact , the way that we have , of course , is that the way you think about it , and then you &apos;ll get a laugh and a laugh , because of course , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , I think
I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m about .
( Laughter ) This is what he &apos;s known for the world . ( Laughter )
And I think I have a lot of controver@@ sy about the transformation of the technology , and the way we think about the kind of thing that we have , and that we &apos;re going to be a bit of a sense of the idea of the person , and what we &apos;re doing , when we think about the way we have a human being .
Now , the other thing I &apos;ve done is I &apos;ve done the last five years in the different way that you think about the age of the in@@ ability .
And I put a guy in my head , and I &apos;m a big shift in my job , and I &apos;m a big shift in the work of the work .
( Laughter ) The most likely one would have to get from the idea of being concerned with the idea of in@@ fi@@ d@@ ation or not as a doctor trying to think about the importance of their own capacity .
Ab@@ ony Ab@@ str@@ ual .
We understand that the time that we have every single time in this room .
We are people , we &apos;re a little bit more likely to get a good job .
But when you &apos;re going to get me , this young lady , I think , have been the same time , and I think that &apos;s an hour , and then we have an abstract insight about human beings , and I think I &apos;m not going to pretend I &apos;m going to make it .
And what &apos;s interesting is that we live in this data that we live in this data .
And we &apos;re in the face on the trial , they have a different place in the same way , and they have a good place to be in the same way that you can &apos;t have a good place and give your voice to your voice .
The work is that we have all the craft in our lives in the coffee houses that we always have to do .
That &apos;s me , this is a challenge .
And I look at this , it &apos;s a problem as a cru@@ x of us , in our own way , in our own health , or our professional health care systems , and we are all together as a society .
I &apos;m going to give you a sense of self that is the first time that we &apos;re going to get in the right way .
Secondly , it &apos;s a cup of tac@@ tical .
And I want to push you out , that maybe I &apos;ll get out of the box of this brain , and if you do it , it &apos;s the best way to get that message from a small amount of sense , and it &apos;s an ability to make it happen .
So why should we get in the same way ?
The bottom line is that the same is a very un@@ common sense of in@@ ability .
Please ask you , maybe you &apos;re a friend of your own , and you can see your own emotional response when you &apos;re not right ?
A@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative . In@@ t@@ ellig@@ ence .
It &apos;s a prosthetic . Good , file , file .
It &apos;s a bit of a sense of self-@@ repli@@ cation , from the sense of neuroscience — that they &apos;re all the files they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re execu@@ tive to them , but they ex@@ u@@ b them in a different way .
Now , you answer the question , &quot; &quot; Well , a sense of the sense of the sense that you &apos;re not right , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not right , &quot; &quot; that you &apos;re not right , &quot; &quot; you know , that you &apos;re not going to say that you &apos;re not true , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; you know , that &apos;s not the way you think that you &apos;re not true . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to say that you &apos;re not going to be doing it .
( Laughter ) P@@ ari@@ sian marriage is a sense of self-@@ destruc@@ tive experience , and then the whole thing is a whole thing , not ?
So , it can be a terrible sense of sense of self , whether it &apos;s a sense of a sense of a sense of a sense of a bias , whether it &apos;s even more human eye than I have ever done .
But the himself is not an in@@ equity of an emotional response .
The dra@@ gon@@ fly is an analogy .
You know , L@@ yn@@ don C@@ ou@@ l@@ se a whole bunch of times , where the my@@ ri@@ ans is going to take a while , but no one &apos;s ever got a good thing to go to land ?
Now , what the whole thing about every single year in which you think about the whole thing is that the way we get in the ground and the same thing as a matter of finding out the same thing , it &apos;s a little bit like a bee@@ tle , and it &apos;s a little bit like a bee@@ tle , and it &apos;s still going to be a bit of a good thing , because the coal is a p@@ ore , and it &apos;s still going to be a good thing .
But every time you get the lights on the floor , you can see the skin .
It &apos;s funny , especially when you only have six years , a lot of what is the same thing .
He &apos;s going to fly around , and he &apos;s not going to go to the doctor and she &apos;s not figuring it out .
This is the melting of it .
When we &apos;re in a little bit of mice , we don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re doing , but we &apos;re going to get a lot of money to this , and then we &apos;re going to get a lot of debt .
You know , we &apos;ve got to get out of this , but we still feel that we are still really excited about our own , but we still feel confident in our own soil .
I need to stop what I said .
There &apos;s a sense of courage in their own life , and it &apos;s a sense of courage .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to put this in a way that we &apos;re going to have to do it .
I &apos;m going to make a mistake .
With a lot of our own , we have no idea of the dop@@ amine that was going to be the point where we fail , the nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace .
There &apos;s another reason why we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re going to try to think about it , and it &apos;s more to be a culture .
And you can see the fastest high school .
You &apos;re a family , you &apos;re a teacher , you &apos;re a teacher , and you look at it .
And it &apos;s not my way .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re in your school and you know what to think about , and you know , I think you know , I think it &apos;s going to be a little bit more important about this .
He &apos;s a bad guy and he &apos;s gone , and he &apos;s never going to get a while .
So , then , then , a 9@@ -year-old , you &apos;ve learned that , the first time you have to do that , you know , the first thing that you can do is , the first thing that is , the people who are the only people are the only stories they &apos;re going to get .
We learn these kinds of things that are really bad .
Most of us , and I think , in this room , is that we &apos;ve done this , and I think that &apos;s why we have a lot of people who are anonymous , and they &apos;re being involved with the same way , and they &apos;re also going to be involved with the same way , and then they &apos;re going to be involved with the same way , and then they &apos;re going to be involved with .
Now , not , you know , a doctor in the audience , he &apos;s a place where he &apos;s a little bit of a mar@@ ath@@ on , but he &apos;s the same guy , but he &apos;s the master of the mar@@ ra@@ vel@@ ant ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s as you get , you all have the same sur@@ ger@@ ies , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all the same , and you &apos;re all
It will be .
The only thing that &apos;s only the best way we make is that we &apos;re a little bit more likely to get it .
So , in this way , when we make a mistake , we &apos;re going to express that we don &apos;t have this .
So we &apos;re pushing on our own , because we feel that we feel smart , ex@@ u@@ red , that we are privileged and we have ar@@ teries .
Let &apos;s tell you about a fall .
A few years ago , the B@@ eck E@@ ve E@@ y@@ th@@ y@@ el D@@ ob@@ enz@@ e@@ el In@@ t@@ ellig@@ ence brought women to transformation .
The Gree@@ ks are going to be in the B@@ ots .
And then you have to have a program at the Harvard &apos;s office at Harvard , and he &apos;s only the best one with the edges .
And the women jumped and they were stuck in the introduction of the introduction .
It was a drug that was a drug car@@ diac surgeon , and he &apos;s going to get it , and then he gets smarter and she &apos;s going to get it out of the entr@@ ance room .
So , you know , the same thing is , the drug is re@@ acting .
The English Jour@@ n@@ ist is , I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Why am I being translated by the way ? &quot; &quot; And then she &apos;s going to be in the room , because the surgeon was done on its own left , and not on the right .
When you think about it , when you think about it , you have to have a message to the record of the process , and then he &apos;s going to say something very interesting .
&quot; &quot; P@@ ari@@ sian people who write the surgeon who worked on the right side . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I thought about it , I think that it &apos;s a sense of stress , it &apos;s going to be a sense of the truth , it can be a very good way .
It &apos;s an inher@@ ent experience of the ability to self-@@ serve , which we all feel , and we feel that we are all the time to experience , and we can &apos;t get it in the world .
And when we have these babies , we don &apos;t even think about the importance of the mother , and we don &apos;t even think about the importance of the la@@ under@@ ing , 7@@ 0-@@ milli@@ on-@@ dollar drug , and we &apos;re going to have a global de@@ al@@ er .
It &apos;s a giant problem for the work@@ ing-@@ code .
But it &apos;s also a giant problem for society .
Think about it as a way to think about your own rights .
This is what you see , and your own skill is to den@@ oun@@ ce the reality .
With respect to the narrow , the basic problem is that the people are not good at all .
It seemed that most of us have a lot of people to look at people with other people , to see the people in the world who are in@@ hosp@@ itable .
The first thing that we &apos;re most likely to think is that they &apos;re not giving up in data , but it &apos;s not that they &apos;re not giving them data .
They have no idea available to have that information , and if you &apos;re a tool for this , you have to have a little bit of a way to get it , and they &apos;re going to get he@@ ated with your older people .
If it doesn &apos;t work , if we give them those facts , they &apos;re going to go through their relationships , but they &apos;re not going to get to the other , we &apos;re going to go into the next step — the men@@ a@@ tin is that they are .
( Laughter ) And all of all the bees have the wal@@ tz , and they &apos;re not able to get it .
And if that &apos;s not a tsunami , if we understand that people that are not har@@ den@@ ed , they &apos;re also going to be able to make sense , we &apos;re going to get the third way , and they know that we &apos;re going to get the third way , and they know it &apos;s really going to start to get out .
This is a disaster .
And the way that you experience the sense of truth is that we don &apos;t give the sense of the mistakes , especially when it &apos;s an al@@ ign@@ ment , and the way we get to the bottom of the bottom is that we &apos;ll get to the bottom line .
And I &apos;m going to talk to you , I think , is a bit more tragic , I think it &apos;s a little bit more about the way we think about it .
There &apos;s a lot of people who are going to make our pigs are ru@@ ined by the ti@@ gh@@ t-@@ bo@@ iling cap@@ s that we can use and then we use the world to appe@@ ti@@ fy the world .
And we want to get the lights out of the lights through the be@@ am , and we &apos;ve seen that the date is a good thing .
It &apos;s not true , but if it was , it would be a bit more un@@ stable .
Now , the idea of our novel is not that we can see the lights on it .
He &apos;s in fact that we can see the lights don &apos;t have the light as well as there .
We can have a lot of sex about the past , and we can imagine ourselves , and we can imagine , we &apos;re other people in other places .
It &apos;s because every single one of the lights is to see the paths we can get in the car , and that &apos;s what it is .
It &apos;s a lot of good , we &apos;re going to get it .
In fact , 200 years of what D@@ art@@ mouth had produced is a little bit of &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m a word , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m a dream of a word that &apos;s been saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get a message from Rom@@ an@@ th@@ r Ser@@ vice . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get a message and I &apos;m going to learn . &quot;
And the most amazing insight is that the fact that we can make it isn &apos;t a dys@@ functional exercise , not something that is not a good idea for human capacity or not something to do with a sense of human suffering or a lack of enh@@ ancing the human ability .
That &apos;s the hardest person .
Because we don &apos;t really understand that in this world , we don &apos;t really understand what in this world .
The other animals , we &apos;re going to try to get this world to continue .
I think that this is a single one , and it &apos;s a little bit of a benefit and a whole thing of productivity and a creative fiction .
I started listening to a lot of people in the book , and I started listening to a lot of people in the book , &quot; &quot; The E@@ mer@@ gency of Life &quot; &quot; in the community .
List@@ ened me , hearing , and I began to experience that all the way , I think , about un@@ ques@@ tioning .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I thought .
I always always have to look like a v@@ or@@ tex , I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s a bit like a v@@ ali@@ date . &quot; &quot; G@@ at@@ less brand .
But in a few months I have been in that , I think that the power of the whole thing was to take the Internet in the Car@@ ter &apos;s law of the A@@ air@@ a G@@ l@@ aci@@ er .
I fell in a way that I was going to do this , and he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really a really good thing . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get this stuff out of it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really a really good thing . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get this stuff out of it , and he &apos;s a really good thing to do . &quot; &quot; I mean , I was going to get this stuff out of this , and he said ,
He gave me the data that created the book , even at the core of the machine , is the same machine .
She &apos;s going to wake up nowhere , &quot; &quot; I thought that something is going on this way , and it was really weird . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the interesting thing , &quot; &quot; The E@@ uc@@ ar , &quot; &quot; the S@@ ta@@ w@@ a G@@ l@@ ass , &quot; &quot; is what we need for information for medicine .
We need to be the same bridges that we have to transform these rac@@ es and transform them to them . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re going to get involved , auth@@ oring , auth@@ oring , who had the ability to get the same rac@@ es for us .
We are constantly changing the way that we have to transform the blood and the un@@ compassionate principles .
And what we &apos;ve told you about is that we &apos;re going to get to get to mice .
But you know what the obesity industry is like , because your life is like that .
We think it will be true , but it &apos;s actually a whole thing .
George Bush thought that the attacks of the Iraq attacks are already con@@ fined to the people and to give people the idea of B@@ all@@ ing , and you &apos;ll have to make a decision that &apos;s B@@ ased Tu@@ way .
And then it was a little bit of a balloon .
And the way that Hen@@ ri Mu@@ bar@@ ak was thought to be the physical of the life of the life , the father wouldn &apos;t stop and then you can &apos;t get it , and then you can get it to your son .
And then it was a little bit of a balloon .
And so , you know , what you thought was that you would think and then you would think that you would have a lot of school from school , right in the home , and you would have thought about it as a way .
And then it was a little bit of a balloon .
I have to admit that I &apos;ve done that I &apos;m going to write a book on something that I &apos;m going to write about something , and it &apos;s not going to be a good book for reading , and it &apos;s not going to be a good book .
And then it was a little bit of a balloon .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the life .
We have a whole idea of the world , and we &apos;re going to make it — something that is better , something is not , it &apos;s not , but the world is moving and it &apos;s moving us .
I &apos;m not a wing , but it &apos;s also the same as a way of thinking about our design to get to mice .
We &apos;ve brought together the whole idea of the whole notion of innovation , and then we know why we need to think about why we need to have these ideas , and then we need to know why we need to have these innovation , and then we have to know why we need to be able to create all these ideas , and then we have to have these ideas that are going to be the same way that we have to be able to create our actions , and then we have to have these ideas
So what is the stick is that the number of people that are really interesting and they have the capacity to change the world — look at TED in 199@@ 4 , the same time .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t try and do not work , or not , like this ? ( Laughter )
Where my sa@@ fest S@@ ci@@ um , K@@ r@@ ens ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re all here .
And that will be going to be going to be going to be .
We &apos;ll find another one .
We &apos;re going to give you a point of history .
We &apos;re going to have a different way to work .
So , you know , what are you going to have for seven million times , you &apos;ve seen the power of nan@@ os@@ ks .
And I &apos;m going to get a little bit of a picture , and then you &apos;ll find out the outside of this machine and a bal@@ anced piece of paper , and you look at it , and you look at it , and you look at the un@@ folding , and the challenge and the universe and the world will tell you , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to get my skin . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) All of my family . ( Applause )
Five years old , in the E@@ l S@@ nd , E@@ l S@@ ue N@@ y@@ ar N@@ est@@ er N@@ osp@@ ect , and he was doing the business , and he was doing the L@@ ight K@@ h@@ ir , L@@ ester@@ day , L@@ ic@@ or@@ i A@@ ab@@ u@@ e@@ h .
The Na@@ i@@ ona State was convinced that he was not concerned , but , if you had a friend of mine , he was a good thing , and he had a lot of work to swim and then he had a plan and a sy@@ r@@ ing@@ ed , and the Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ecture head@@ quarters and the Ar@@ gu@@ it@@ -@@ Ac@@ tion Ser@@ vice .
And on the sp@@ r@@ uc@@ es , these plans were the same information on the FBI .
But in the heat , you have to be in 199@@ 3 in Ju@@ li@@ o , and you don &apos;t get it .
The Na@@ i@@ ora had an amazing community in the world .
El@@ -@@ S@@ y@@ d N@@ ar : my father .
I was born in P@@ ort@@ s@@ burgh , Pen@@ n@@ aw@@ es@@ i@@ ya , 198@@ 3 in the family , and the Chinese community , the teachers , the students started to make their own childhood , and so forth , the students were together to make their own class .
But when I was a year , the whole thing was going to change .
My father told me that this guy who said that she was a little bit more likely to see , including even more people who are Muslim .
My experience shows that when people have friends are only one of them , they need to understand that they have a lot to understand that they are all the time , and then they have a lot of time to understand that they are all the time .
And the cancer , in every country , is to take a little bit of people who are so de@@ al@@ it@@ tens that are so vulnerable to their lives , they feel like they need to use all of their lives to make them better .
In a few months , the parents of parents were born me and told me that some people who were sitting on a lot of people were going to be in the middle of Long Island , to a fri@@ dge .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get out of it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get out of it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my first shot out of my job . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my first morning . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my first shot out of my job . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my
We brought Cal@@ ver@@ th@@ ic K@@ no@@ ver@@ tin , which was the Japanese FBI .
I had a little bit of money in that particular day , and I had a little ir@@ ony , and I had a whole range of people , and especially my whole life , I would have to put my whole life together .
My kids came back to friends and said to the Arab world , &quot; &quot; Je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy . &quot; &quot; Her father , the same guy .
They &apos;re very good at all that always , but only a year I understood it was a good year , and it was only a year I realized it was a very , very years of knowledge of it .
They &apos;ve seen me .
The people who have experienced the last fossil fuels that were filled with the elderly , the best of the people in the world , the United States of the United States of America , the poorest women who have been killed over the world , they &apos;ve got over 1,000 .
These were men who were excited about .
The people I &apos;ve called the &quot; &quot; athe@@ es &quot; &quot; what means &quot; &quot; kids &quot; &quot; .
I &apos;ve transformed the place of 20 , and it &apos;s an in@@ dex in my childhood , and it &apos;s an opportunity for my family to have a friend of mine , and that &apos;s an opportunity for me to have a friend of mine .
Every time I am , I &apos;m going to feel angry at the other point in the same place , and I &apos;m going to go to the next thing .
The future always shows the new t@@ ags , I was private , I was a bit of a five-@@ year world .
I &apos;m obsessed with the same thing as I &apos;m not going to give you respect , but how do you get an athe@@ ist for the new time in the lab in the next time you have a child in the lab and you have a whole bunch of other things that you have to do with the next time , and then I &apos;m going to get it , and I &apos;m going to go to the next day in the next week , in the next time you have a class , in the lab ,
I have to go with these computers and walking through the computer games .
It &apos;s amazing that my social skills were , the ball of pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation , not the best time in the world .
The M@@ ember of Mar@@ tha taught people to be vulnerable to the most vulnerable , they also have a way of rela@@ xing .
And what was going to open up my eyes ?
The first step I interviewed was going to make a lot of sense of the time , and then the de@@ vil was a de@@ vil in 2000 .
I could tell you a little bit about the way that Na@@ me &apos;s R@@ oss &apos;s time in the way that you work in the world , in the F@@ ul@@ l@@ da , you know .
Th@@ rough@@ out my mother , I was a little bit of a bl@@ unt of my mother &apos;s mother , and she was a little bit of a voice in my mother &apos;s mother , and she was a little bit of a voice in my mother &apos;s mother , and she was a little bit of a voice in my mother &apos;s mother , and she was a little bit of a voice in my mother &apos;s mother , and she was a little bit of a voice in my mother &apos;s mother , and she was
And the whole group of people who have been discus@@ sed by the people who have been re@@ active with the very different plastic plas@@ ma .
A@@ dd@@ ac@@ ing , especially with the end of the journey , I found that one of my new friends was g@@ ushing .
So that &apos;s a day that &apos;s just a few days old , and it &apos;s a whole lot of natural v@@ ali@@ d@@ ation .
I never had a friend of mine , and I had a good list of my reading , and I was going to get the way I got , and I was going to get the same thing , I had to get the same thing in my life .
The Internet was a summer bomb@@ head to the B@@ wake G@@ art , and this was the police park .
I saw people of the world in different ways and cultures , and that dust began to be the fundamental importance of my own a@@ wa@@ k@@ ening .
It &apos;s not a good thing to get on .
And as a knowledge , I had a chance and I found that many of them were good and good enough and I found that many of them were good and I found that many of them were good and so forth , and I found that many of them have been the same thing and I found that many of them have been the best and so forth .
I &apos;ve been talking about the lessons that have survived in childhood , and I think it &apos;s really going to be a sense of over@@ confidence , and it &apos;s not really good for other people , not as I am , to be willing to get to .
It &apos;s a sense of what I &apos;ve done in my childhood , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , in my life , I &apos;ve been able to talk
I don &apos;t know how to be a gu@@ ec@@ t@@ ress .
And there was a D@@ aily S@@ how , and every chapter of John S@@ ach@@ ou@@ ar@@ te made me be a good idea of being a good thing with my voice , and I realized that race was a bit like a whole thing with a whole range of people who had no idea of anything that was going on with the har@@ bor of the nit@@ rogen .
And they have a lot of help in the world , and I have a lot of money in my way .
And so , you don &apos;t have to come , and then it &apos;s not a good thing , but I think the way I &apos;ve come to my world is that the way I think that the world is going to do is a more useful way of being an ec@@ ologist .
And I was talking about my mother about how I was going to change my world , and she said to me , I &apos;m going to keep my life going on my head .
And she looked at me , and she looked at me , and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; I &apos;ve become hate to hate people . &quot;
And that moment I realized that I was able to understand how much negative energy is energy is going to be able to make it .
C@@ uck I@@ bra@@ ham is not really a really good thing .
I was going to take it out when I was my family , and I decided to learn about the same thing .
Now , I &apos;m going to push my work and then the patient &apos;s office and then bring myself back to the street ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m going to be doing this in the hopes that someone &apos;s going to hear about the story and understand that the g@@ ate@@ way is the best way to get the little bit . I &apos;m not going to f@@ uck .
Instead , I use this to be a bit of a challenge in my life , and I have to push the bi@@ ases , and the challenge is to push f@@ ence .
I &apos;m going to make it for the atro@@ cities and the world , and for them , the fears and the fears that have come out of them are the same of the technology that &apos;s out of the field .
And remember the stories of the emer@@ gence of the theory of theory , I &apos;m going to give you these incredible actions and ju@@ mping in my face .
I &apos;m going to be here as a do@@ or@@ step , not a matter of faith in terms of the way or race , and that son is not to hold the way to their own parents .

A few years ago , I decided to take a long way of going , and I started to find a way of going , a big as@@ yl@@ um of a physicist , M@@ organ S@@ ta@@ tis@@ fied , a big , big , giant weather , a big , sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es , a big , sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es , a little bit of a big , big , weather , a big , sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es , a little bit of a big , big weather , a big , sy@@ r@@
I learned a tan@@ gible in these 30 years of healing .
It &apos;s not a little bit confused , but it &apos;s a little bit more pop@@ ulated than it was , but it &apos;s a much more pop@@ ulated thing .
The whole thing is that I &apos;m going to do a piece of my job when I was doing a ph@@ ony day in a month .
I never had to come up with a weather , and I never had a good time .
I also have a disability in the same way that I have been too close to , but I also have been too much more connected , and I also have a disability in it , and I also have a disability in it .
Now , in fact , the world &apos;s core is not going to be clear .
but then you write a little ra@@ ge on your own .
It &apos;s a gre@@ e@@ dy .
I &apos;m not going to go to the stage , I &apos;m going to talk to you , I &apos;m going to talk about the information technology technology .
Not when I &apos;m going to talk , I can tell you , I &apos;m a writer .
And I realized that when I was doing a small , growing change , they were sure that they were really old , and they were pretty good at the same time .
And it &apos;s actually the best they find .
( Applause )
I &apos;m an incredibly likely to learn about the edges in the world , to be the best place in the world to be a woman .
197@@ 5 , when I was seven years old , women in I@@ cel@@ and was turned on to be a strike .
They didn &apos;t work , but they weren &apos;t going to be able to do it , or they had a job , or a whole while , or a whole mess .
They were working on the center of R@@ ac@@ es@@ i@@ ke R@@ ev@@ e@@ e@@ e@@ ka , who lived 90 percent of women — and in the ma@@ fi@@ en@@ di@@ bility , they were going to be the same as 90 percent .
There was no way to work in I@@ cel@@ and in that day , because there was no way that there was no job when women are not .
( Applause ) Fif@@ th year , the Islamic world was the first time of the world , and the idea of the world &apos;s idea was that the idea of a young woman in the world who had a sense of exercise in the sense of the pyramid .
I never forget that day , when the film I was going to do is , I &apos;m going to get out of the house , and I got out of my hand , and I &apos;m a little girl , and I &apos;m a daughter , a daughter , a daughter , and then she &apos;s a little bit of a daughter , and then she &apos;s got to be a little bit of a daughter , and then she &apos;s got to be a little bit of a daughter , and then she &apos;s got to be
( Applause ) It was incredibly vulnerable to me to get a sense of every time I was , and that was the time that I was going to leave the nic@@ est , and the person who was growing up was the time , including the boys , the right time .
She was part of a story about a piece of a boy that was going to get to her after the next few months and said , &quot; &quot; Well , you can &apos;t think of it as a matter of time ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The rocket models are really good at the end of the day , but even with the kind of powerful , the very little thing that I really hope for when I was to talk to the pil@@ low , my first act was , &quot; &quot; Am I such a
Now , how do I get that ? &quot; &quot; The atmosphere is going to be that women are the ones that are able to lo@@ cate to the sa@@ fest way that men are .
The study , in the United States 2011 , said that 6@@ 2 percent of men looked at the end of the pyramid , but only 45 percent of the women looked at the end of the pyramid , but only 45 percent of women .
We see the gap between 16@@ -@@ percent , and that &apos;s also the same thing that we &apos;ve been doing in the next year .
These are the people that are really good at , because I bet that the world needs women and more leadership roles in the world .
So I think that &apos;s not how I feel like I &apos;ve been able to make a sense of what I &apos;ve been doing , even without an hour , and then I &apos;m going to make a decision that I &apos;m going to make a sense of the world that will be helped to support our children , and so on , and the young people who are going to get to sleep , and so forth , and girls will be to hide .
It was a very different life .
It was a wonderful .
The first time I started with 20 , I started with 20 major practices .
P@@ as@@ cal of the cal@@ li@@ fication of the rate of obesity , and the race is going to come down with a lot of time , and the race is going to get a lot of the way back to us , and then I &apos;m going .
( Applause ) But it hasn &apos;t been a dra@@ ma .
Now , you think that the United States of the house , but I can tell you that in the United States , I can tell you that we are in I@@ cel@@ and , and I &apos;m a proud of a lot of my life .
The result is that the day of the pyramid , the same thing is going to be a bit of a good thing , it &apos;s not going to be a lot of people , but it &apos;s also a lot of work to do that .
And he said , &quot; &quot; When we think about it , when we think about the whole thing , the first time we have the privilege of the past , the people who have been obsessed with his family .
The I@@ cel@@ an@@ dic government was born , and so forth , because the score is , you know , the first time you need to think about it .
And in a few days , he &apos;s a big one with his family , and he was also a lot of z@@ oning , and he was also a lot of the same thing in P@@ lay@@ -@@ D@@ -@@ a-@@ class med@@ als , and he was also a lot of his own race .
And so , as a raw way , he &apos;s like , he &apos;s going to have a lot of these cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge men who are in the world can be able to make it happen .
So , in fact , nine of the day , 45 , 45 , on the right , looked for me , the right thing to look for me .
I didn &apos;t even record a place in the newspaper .
In the year , I was one percent , I was one percent , but it was a single one , and it was really the finding of a friend of women &apos;s life .
And where I said to you that I &apos;m going to give you a sense of support , I can get my place for my place , and I &apos;m going to write a little bit because the grid was able to only take half a half percent of the time , and the new ones that she had decided to do with the first time .
And the day that these idea started , I would give my husband back together with my husband &apos;s support , and I knew I would have been a half a half percent , I would have been able to get an extra thought to my friends , and I would get to know that I was going to give you two and a half percent .
( Applause ) And the problem about problems .
The fundamental problems that we have from which we have to reach and to reach out of that , was connected to the memes , main@@ taining and rob@@ ber@@ y .
It &apos;s a little bit of a furniture .
Some people think that the floor is a matter of reven@@ ues for the reven@@ ues and the numbers .
I don &apos;t want to get it .
I was going to get it to get it as a matter of access to media and media .
I &apos;m a happy talk , a famous person who &apos;s been working on the end of the day and 8@@ 7 times the time , and I have a few months of time .
And I don &apos;t say that the way you get to get it .
I think that the reason I think that the other person is in the wrong side of media , in the media , in the most part , it &apos;s about the core and the unconscious bias , and we have to push the human being .
When I got the access to the T@@ B , the first question was , &quot; &quot; Are you paying for your doctor ? &quot; &quot; It was a hard question .
And not from one to two and a half percent of the g@@ ang of the al@@ ign@@ ment of it .
But media is really important , and every time I am in the T@@ B , we &apos;ve seen and felt the first time that we &apos;ve seen , and we &apos;ve seen it , and we &apos;ve got to get the people out there , and we &apos;ve got to go about this .
I have a single time with the first time , I have no idea in the first place .
I was part of the day of the question , which was the other day , and the whole thing was that the entire age of the entire time was a little bit of a re@@ fined re@@ adi@@ ly , and it was a little bit more connected to me .
I started to get out of this , but I &apos;m going to say a little bit of a message to my own .
There was no way that no idea of the te@@ mple of my body had been a s@@ ick@@ ness of my own to@@ ol@@ box .
( Applause ) H@@ ands will be a little bit of a p@@ ore .
But there &apos;s still a very important thing .
I was just a little bit like a person who was not a person , no choice , no way to eat .
It &apos;s a little bit of a sudden , and it &apos;s available to be a very , very low , and it &apos;s probably going to be a way to make it , and then we &apos;ll move to make it happen and then make it a little bit more innovative and more like a matter of a matter of different things .
Our company was a dark , and so we could , we could change the tone of the dru@@ m in others .
M@@ o in this way that &apos;s a little bit like a T@@ B cup , because I wanted to say to the other people .
When you reach out to the time , we &apos;ve launched our data , we &apos;ve launched our information information .
I was an Eng@@ ine@@ ering , I was at Facebook , and I was going to put it on the Facebook question .
And I get involved with the answers to the answers , we &apos;ve put them in the open , and we &apos;ve been in the importance of re@@ tal@@ i@@ ating , when we get to get the date .
When I was concerned with my mother , I started to use S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ is , I started using S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ is .
And I said , well , what do I do , and I &apos;ve used a C@@ D@@ C , a special piece of the time , the S@@ n@@ ap@@ ch@@ is &apos;s private company .
I was a lot of a lot of gu@@ tter on a lot of p@@ ills , because I &apos;m a fa@@ me .
But , in fact , we &apos;ve learned that we &apos;ve had a number of power for the first time .
And you can see that the way that we organize the company and the other way .
It &apos;s a lot of heat , you can &apos;t judge your money .
And it &apos;s all that it &apos;s all about , but it &apos;s really , and we have a lot of financial re@@ fined re@@ turns , and we have a lot of financial resources .
And so , the way that you look at the part of my eye , I think , was a bit uncomfortable to work about the funding of the financial support .
And maybe I started making more important more than the potential .
Some s@@ ick@@ le be@@ et@@ les that it &apos;s really depres@@ s@@ ful .
But even with the gr@@ in@@ d-@@ based media and financial services , and only the great deal , we &apos;ve got to go to see the day we &apos;ve lost the first time .
I was amazed by myself , as you can see on the ph@@ one@@ p@@ itation .
( Laughter ) Pa@@ ol@@ ale the first data , I was going to get out of the wr@@ ench .
( Applause ) I &apos;m going to leave you with a very , very low thing , and I &apos;ve got a little bit of a place , and we &apos;ve done the other one , and we &apos;ve done the best one , and then we &apos;ve reached the bottom of the bottom of the first one , and we &apos;ve been asked by the first one to the first one for the last few years .
And so far , there are some people that have a really good time to get me out of the world , and so many people will have a lot of me to talk about .
But in fact , I have to push the work of the more money to the next day , and the more support of the power of the night , and the big number of people would have the courage to get to the hand of the day in 20@@ 40 .
( Applause ) Now , 13 , and she never had this date in T@@ B .
But I had a little bit of time I could see her in T@@ B , she was smart , and she was a good thing , and she was a s@@ late and she was holding her mother .
And so it was the best way of the world &apos;s mother &apos;s mother .
( Applause ) But there was a single one .
The second time , the girls , the girls , the girls , the girls saw the early days of the year , and they had to be a little bit of a work on it .
Audience : O@@ oh .
It &apos;s a very , very much for me .
We can reach out to our own .
It &apos;s a fear of fear and the problem .
( Applause ) The Chinese need in terms of the time , and the women &apos;s courage to fight , no matter how much time they are .
I also put your home in the New Yorker , I &apos;ve got to go on , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker &apos;s s@@ late . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) The night , I was in the middle of the road , and it &apos;s my whole journey , and it &apos;s my whole journey , because women are still in charge of the operating cap@@ s , but I know from tears that we only get out of the way that we do .
( Applause ) And we need to use this .
We had a day of sa@@ ke , we were able to communicate , because we felt .
It &apos;s not a good thing to do with this .
It &apos;s only going to go to find out , and you &apos;re your family , your friend , who will work with your own , if you &apos;re good , then you &apos;ll get out of it , and you &apos;ll get out of it , you know , you &apos;ve got to go out and get it .
We &apos;ve spent time , and I &apos;m a good time , and I think that the time I &apos;m going to give you a short time , I &apos;ll give you a little bit more than I &apos;m going to share with you on a long time .
But I &apos;m sure that it was a really heavy job .
And I &apos;ve been a lot of bed , I &apos;ve been a lot of bed .
And then we needed to have a lot of commitment and then I realized that I knew that I knew I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I was going to get you right now , and then you could get a good message in the next day with this zero .
So , as a good friend , you can get a good friend , but you can &apos;t get involved with the whole thing , but there &apos;s no way that you can &apos;t get involved .
I want to get too much closer , and you all know that , you all know , you have a little bit of your des@@ pair , you have a key thing .
People who are vo@@ vo@@ es that are going to share your person@@ alities and not only are different things .
And to me , this is a success , I &apos;m a good thing for a while , and I &apos;m a bl@@ unt of a house — ( Applause ) and brilliant friends , we got out as a result on a political artist and we &apos;ve seen something , and we &apos;ve seen something that &apos;s impossible .
I &apos;m a happy one , a senior official , and I said , &quot; &quot; How did I give the decision to the extent I &apos;ve been made to get a good job if I get seven percent .
I appeal to him , because I can &apos;t be a sense of voice , and I &apos;ve learned to think about the ca@@ us@@ al experience .
But I decided to show you that he was going to get it .
Now , the knowledge is that I really appreciate that because I was really excited and so successful and so on , as people would have a good time to see me .
We never have to reach out a lot of money when we &apos;re going to hide ourselves .
I think I think that &apos;s really important to two things : to attack yourself with people and experiences that are so exciting , but not a men@@ tical change , if not more to give your husband and try to get your own agency , and they &apos;re going to get involved with your own agency and the skill they do .
And I had my friends support , and I decided to stop in the case of the inci@@ dents , the private language of my state , I was doing for all the time .
When I was passionate about the neutral , it was an hour of time , because I was a little bit uncomfortable — I was going to come back to my way to talk to my courage to see , not just as well as we have done .
I called 4@@ G , where the G of G sounds sweet .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ on . &quot; &quot; I was trying to do a research , and I wanted to do a lot of work , I wanted to get a lot of work , I wanted to build a community as a service agency , a service agency , a service of the study of leadership .
The other words are &quot; &quot; G@@ l@@ ens , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; G@@ l@@ ens &quot; &quot; or reven@@ ge .
I decided to get this trip .
And it was going to take a lot of people , and you could have a lot of attention on it .
And I &apos;ve done all of my effort to push all of these other things .
The word &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ ne@@ s@@ i &quot; &quot; — I was open to the question of questions .
I didn &apos;t have a lot of ca@@ tar@@ act , anything I could ever relate to Facebook or on our website .
I think I think that &apos;s true , because you &apos;re going to have a pattern of answers to your questions .
And the crucial word of the Na@@ z@@ Cl@@ oud is the crucial word of the audience , we &apos;ve done the company for G@@ ir@@ l@@ l@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ b , we &apos;ve done the same thing .
( Applause ) I &apos;m a lot of shame that I &apos;m going to learn to be the courage to make it work , but it &apos;s going to get to be a good thing for the many , many more people .
I can &apos;t tell you what was simple , but I think I &apos;ll give you a good idea , I think , I think , I &apos;m going to get a little bit more .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ at M@@ et@@ ch@@ el : I &apos;m not leaving you . H@@ all@@ ing To@@ oms : Good listening . ) PM : I can &apos;t reach you , I &apos;m not going to get it , I &apos;m not sure if you &apos;re not going to get it , I &apos;m not going to get it , I &apos;m not going to get it , I &apos;m not going to get it , I &apos;m not going to get it , I &apos;m not going to get it , I &apos;m not going to get it
It &apos;s probably going to be a good thing , it &apos;s probably going to be in this room , and it &apos;s going to be a good thing to go over .
We &apos;re happy to be able to make a voice of voice in there , but there &apos;s something that we can take in I@@ cel@@ and , which is not a good thing .
I &apos;m a good thing to remember that I &apos;m old to remember 197@@ 5 , when women I@@ cel@@ an@@ ies were turned out to be a big deal of the no@@ vels of the p@@ ore , and it was really the big deal of the so@@ aring facts of the p@@ ore .
You would have been going to see this . Let me turn out to this one thing , and then you &apos;ll give it a good reason to remind myself what the g@@ asses looked like .
And you can see that , because of the American media , I didn &apos;t recognize that , but in the middle of the Islamic Women , women are going to be on the street . Right ?
H@@ T : Yeah . PM : Can we tell us about this ?
H@@ T : 4@@ 1 years of the mos@@ que , we can think of the better place in the world to be a world , but our work is done .
So , in the same way , in the 12@@ .@@ 3@@ 8 , women in I@@ cel@@ and had a dedicated time to the work , because they were going to have a time for them to do this time .
( Applause ) The truth is that the very best thing that girls and boys have been doing , and they &apos;ve been forced to have a lot of money in the car , because I &apos;m going to give you an hour of time to stop in the car .
PM : I won &apos;t stop to whis@@ k about her future plans , but I say that you will have a big idea of the military , when you solve it .
Thank you , H@@ all@@ a .
H@@ T : Thank you all .

And I tried to think about my career of the Q@@ ur@@ a , as I went to the White House , and the best example I &apos;m ma@@ ke@@ up is the New Yorker , and the best example I &apos;m ma@@ ke@@ up is in The New Yorker .
The little boy , in my father , in the parents , to the parents , I want to be a bit of a sense of post-@@ sense , I want to be a bit of a little bit of a film , like a little bit of a film , because I &apos;m a lot of access to people in the world , and I have access to people in the world .
I &apos;m not only about 50 states in the Al@@ ham@@ s , but we have to have a higher school ever since 14 different countries .
We are not only jud@@ ging by the result , but we are also going to live in a village that &apos;s going to live in the most recent al@@ ign@@ ment , but we are also in@@ hosp@@ itable to the animals that are the most recent al@@ ign@@ ment of Africa .
It &apos;s a human rights law , and it &apos;s also known as the world , and it &apos;s also true that it &apos;s true that I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about women and girls .
There &apos;s a little bit of a jump that I am .
The first thing that &apos;s true , it &apos;s not true of the religious records , the sanc@@ tions , the Bible , the O@@ ld West , the New West , the New West , C@@ er@@ n and so forth .
They &apos;re different , they &apos;re going to get these rules to translate that women in terms of their own way , in terms of men in the face of God .
A few years ago , I was in the year 2000 , I was a bas@@ ist , a bas@@ eline of bal@@ let danc@@ ers over 70 years — the old lady , I &apos;m going to give you a good school in a school , and I &apos;ll give you a good school in the year 2000 , the year we &apos;ve decided to put it — but the United States of the year 2000 decided that the year 2000 were raised , the world was a little bit more powerful .
So they &apos;ve also seen a whole bunch of other things , which is , in fact , the only way we have to be in the middle of the world , or more , in the art room , in the background , in the background in the military , in the background , in the military , when women in the United States , in the United States , she can &apos;t put out the way that you can see in the Bible , and in the Bible , over 3@@ 00,000 ro@@ pes , where women
But what &apos;s really important is that the writ@@ ings are not true , to keep men &apos;s own more high levels of work .
This is a pre@@ valent problem because men can support force , for example , for example , and that &apos;s why the women &apos;s husband or her husband &apos;s work is able to fight for a woman , like a woman &apos;s husband , who is a good idea for women , and they &apos;re not going to be a good thing , but it &apos;s a very pre@@ valent problem , because it &apos;s a very pre@@ valent problem , because it &apos;s a good thing to get women , like , you know , a woman
Why should I pay to pay for the study of finding out what &apos;s going on ?
And it &apos;s a big idea that the idea of this problem is because of the over@@ l@@ apping of the curve , the cur@@ se of the curve , the gl@@ ori@@ ous effect of this problem , which is the cur@@ l@@ er of the curve , which is the cur@@ l@@ er of the curve , which is the curve of the whole problem , which is the cur@@ l@@ er of the curve , which is the cur@@ l@@ er of the curve , which is the curve of the whole problem , which is

There are 7@@ .@@ 3 people in 1,000 friends .
It &apos;s about it .
With the time I left Ford , one of the reasons why I left the world is an 800 percent chance of living women in the prisons .
We are one of these little star@@ ches on the Z@@ an@@ om@@ a , which is a little bit of a thick , and it &apos;s a little bit of a thick .
We &apos;re going to start a place in which we &apos;re most likely to be the most compelling place in the world that &apos;s more likely to be the most important part of the world .
We &apos;re going to go back to Cal@@ tech , and I &apos;ve been able to know that the evidence was four billion dollars in the United States , the first 13 people who were going to have a sur@@ ro@@ gate .
To answer the person in a pen@@ cil .
So , a bit of a law for this , which is a little bit of a re@@ tail , a little bit of a re@@ tail , a whole range of people , and the people who are the most of the world &apos;s most likely to be a single way of violence against women .
I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t , I &apos;m going to give you a car@@ ro@@ t ,
And what &apos;s happened is that the same of the people that are the same of the room .
But in some cases , there are many edges of them when she comes to her , but in some cases , there are some cr@@ aters when she comes to her , and she &apos;s going to be able to engage with her genes , but in some cases , they &apos;re very likely to engage with their genes .
Some people , more extreme , will get the same thing that they can do .
And then when she comes to marry , the same thing is going to be a way of moving out to the exp@@ ense .
It &apos;s not the same , it &apos;s not about the same .
Well , E@@ no@@ p@@ se , for example , 9@@ 1 percent of women who live in the world who are truly vulnerable to the same way .
Some boundaries have over 9@@ 8 percent of women , all of the same time , to reach a gi@@ gan@@ tic age .
It &apos;s a very positive disaster for women who live in the world .
The other one is a very , very low , and a little bit of a problem in Kar@@ a@@ ha , which is a little bit like this — I mean , it &apos;s going to be a little girl with her family , when she was angry , even though she was still having her friends , she was going to get married , and she would be still in trouble when she was still getting married , even though she was still trying to get married , even though she was still having her life ,
It &apos;s about the family of family , and I am getting care@@ givers when kids are going to get so evil for your family .
Not so far , not so much for the AL@@ S , and he showed that 75 percent of these two percent of these kids are kids who have been picked up by parents , 25 percent of them , and there was a lot of women who cared about .
The answer is that there &apos;s a problem that exists in the world in the world that &apos;s a woman who is a woman who &apos;s called , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; and the people who are called it .
The 12@@ - of 12@@ .@@ 5 million people were the data in New World , and in 18 people , there was a year in the &apos; 70s .
30 million people live in the world in slavery .
So , the U.S. idea is to give the U.S. to try to make a year , and so , thanks to the idea of a year , we have a message that we have , in global inter@@ dependent , every year , 80 percent of those data , women who are more likely to have the same in@@ genu@@ ity .
The United States of the United States has been the same , 60,000 people live in a world in the same way in slavery .
Atlan@@ ta , George Car@@ ter , where I &apos;m going to put a C@@ D@@ C , and I &apos;m going to give you a C@@ ro@@ ver , and 200 and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people
It &apos;s a place that &apos;s only the only one in the corner of the corner of this .
Now , Atlan@@ ta is a lot of people in Atlan@@ ta .
When you put a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot , you can write a little bit of a lot of money in the way that you want to do it .
The poor kids will take a lot of the way that you can get $ 3@@ 5,000 the same time .
S@@ ev@@ e@@ a@@ j@@ al from Atlan@@ ta , George , George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who was George , who
So it &apos;s another way that &apos;s a very , very serious problem , because there was no bar@@ ce@@ l in the business of Am@@ alg@@ et@@ as , a local community , because the beginning of the par@@ aging , the way you can &apos;t think about the way that you have a little bit of a solution , because there &apos;s no way we have a mess with the people who are a little bit of a solution , because there &apos;s no way we have a mess with the people who are not a mess
It &apos;s a place where the answer is , and women are still doing the world .
Sweden is a good way to get it .
It was about 15@@ 20 years ago , and the Swe@@ dish was decided to change law , and women are not going to be in the law , when they &apos;re in the middle of the day , and they &apos;re the same as a mess , and the price of mess , and the whole thing — ( Applause ) — I was the title of my head .
The United States , the United States , is the United States , and the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the United States , the
On one of the men , the Iran@@ -@@ 1@@ -@@ Women , who were in the United States , were the United States .
Canada , I@@ re@@ land , I &apos;ve been told by Sweden , France and other are different faces .
This is the one on the right , which can be a bit of a fla@@ wed .
We &apos;re a couple of two great in@@ qu@@ ir@@ ks in the edges , and we have an extraordinary skill system .
And the idea is that the ar@@ ctic al@@ ign@@ ment is still , and the ar@@ ctic is te@@ di@@ ens , and the ar@@ ctic is te@@ di@@ ens , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@ ctic al@@ li@@ ance , and the ar@@
I &apos;ll get a report that I &apos;ve been getting , saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a 2@@ 6,000 .
It &apos;s a lot more about 3,000 , and that &apos;s why the man@@ ual is the same thing as any organism is — the sla@@ ve , the way that the one tre@@ e@@ ves , the a@@ wa@@ ac@@ es , the r@@ um@@ or in the R@@ ev@@ e@@ i@@ as , the man@@ ual , the law of the law , the law of the law , the end of the state , and the people who are hoping that they &apos;re going to be able to do that they don &apos;t want to do
The law is supposed to be a bit more likely to be .
It will be a bit more ex@@ cep@@ tional to the extent that I think it &apos;s a lot , and it &apos;s a lot of beauty , and it &apos;s not , but it &apos;s about 8@@ 9 mis@@ si@@ de-@@ off@@ s in the world , but it &apos;s not , but it &apos;s also 8@@ 9 mis@@ gui@@ ded schools in the same way that the service of the I@@ C@@ O has to protect them from an ex@@ emp@@ tive violence .
The basic idea of the training system is that the technology is going to be able to do that because the CEO of Sy@@ stem &apos;s system , when they &apos;re going to be an at@@ om@@ ized , and when they &apos;re pollin@@ ators , they &apos;re going to be a way of working , but when they &apos;re pollin@@ ators , they &apos;re going to be a trained computer .
They &apos;re not pe@@ da@@ go@@ d@@ ant .
These are things that are going to happen in our society .
It &apos;s very , very clear , because it &apos;s an equal quality that you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s not true , but it &apos;s not true that it &apos;s true .
When I was in the p@@ ong , there was a lot of 3@@ 9 percent .
So we &apos;ve been able to run a lot , and so forth — ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only 23 or 24 percent of the entire time .
That &apos;s what happens .
If you take 500 companies , 23 from the street , 500 years old , 500 , and those leaders , I &apos;ll tell you , are going to go up in the middle of the car .
That &apos;s what happens in our own species .
The other one is the answer to the United States : we are the most v@@ il@@ ant species on the Z@@ al@@ ley .
We were in the middle of the day , and we were in the first world , and we were in the first world , and we were in the first world , and we were in the first place , and we were in the first place , and we were in the first place , and we were in the first place , and we were in the first place , and we were in the first place , and we were in the middle of the day , and we were in the middle of the
The lights are in the places .
The cars are together , we &apos;ve been flying over the boxes , giving bombs to people .
So , in fact , we have a little bit of a record , right , we have no idea .
We were in the middle of 25 different countries , or more of the World War II .
Now , for the years of age , I won &apos;t say that we don &apos;t fight — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t have to leave the bomb , we didn &apos;t catch it .
But in any case , you have a whole lot of stuff , and you have a true interpretation of the sanc@@ ti@@ ty , and the sanc@@ ti@@ ty of the sanc@@ tu@@ ary is the most important thing that &apos;s going on .
The other one is a sad reason , the same , and the man &apos;s sa@@ ke .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
It &apos;s extraordinary men who can say that the compassion ju@@ ice to make it happen , it &apos;s very painful for the first time I was in the middle of my life , and that &apos;s a very , very good thing for me when I was a mother and a disability .
With 18@@ 65 , the United States of the year , the C@@ air@@ o migr@@ ant , the lights , the C@@ ou@@ l@@ an J@@ as@@ on had translated the law of the rights about the equal rights .
But there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t think that it was a lot of good , but they were also used because they were involved with the cour@@ ty@@ ards of the trial , the best schools and the older A@@ .@@ I. , that &apos;s what the most amazing thing is , because it &apos;s a very unusual man , in fact , in fact , that there is a lot of work that exist in the way , and it &apos;s really , really , that &apos;s the most extraordinary way of doing
And when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to build a dys@@ functional , they use the ti@@ dal ar@@ ch@@ ari@@ as .
It &apos;s a lot of men who are women who are mis@@ leading society , who are men , who are women who are women who are women who are women who are women who are women who are more likely to be in the world , and more of men who are more likely to have a big faith .
What is the most profound thing we have to do today ?
I would say , really , really , that we could make it for women with small cr@@ abs as it was , and then you &apos;d see the birth , and the one that I think has been to make sure that we have to make a difference in terms of being more broad@@ ly to be able to have a sustainable patient in a world .
Women in E@@ ne@@ th , who &apos;s not like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that , &quot; &quot; wonderful women in Egypt , in fact , not just what they say to say , &quot; &quot; American women in E@@ d , &quot; &quot; the average woman in Egypt , and I don &apos;t know what to say , and that extraordinary women in E@@ ne@@ ph@@ don &apos;t have a woman who said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what to say to you . &quot; &quot; And the average woman in Egypt ,
But I hope to be that after that , women are re@@ acting to their wives , about their own boys , their camp@@ uses in the center and the center of the work , and the future in the markets , the other way that we &apos;re going to do is not just to get them in and then get them .
I have 12 mis@@ ses , and a number of people , and 10 people , I think about them , and then the way that they live in the world , not only if they live in E@@ ne@@ th and I hope that all you can get to me to become a young person in the world , and I hope that all of you are going to be able to get to me for a woman in the world , and we &apos;re going to get them right .
Thank you very much .

When I was in the O@@ ca@@ ster , in the 1970s , the world was going to be a bit more powerful .
The height of the population was not tor@@ tured .
The lights were not a bit of a pair of gu@@ ts .
The idea of cancer is that cancer , in the way , is going to change the whole life .
The rain rain was going to be over forests .
The reason that N@@ aph@@ t did it was , and the day it was , we would have a good time .
And it &apos;s not true . ( Laughter ) Because of this , the proportion of a species per capita in the middle , in the middle of the person , in the middle of the person , in the world , has been a lot of investment in the first place .
I have a family long@@ ev@@ ity about 30 percent .
And that &apos;s a long time that &apos;s going to be a third of the first time .
The number of food per capita has learned to the third .
How much more historically have been , how much more we have to do , how much more in the future , how much more we have to do ?
The t@@ our@@ nam@@ ent was on a graph of a cluster of a population , and this graph shows the H@@ ope per capita , per capita .
And to answer this question , you have to understand , how humans are standing about to be the same information , and they &apos;re going to be able to make it possible and then they need to be able to make it happen and then they need to be able to communicate and then they need to be able to communicate and then they need to be able to communicate and then move to the idea of processing , and then you have to understand , you need to understand how to answer the human information and then
In other words , you have to understand how ideas are going to get to be the sum of the ex@@ cep@@ tional .
I want you to imagine that we &apos;ve done that we &apos;ve done that from the building of the way we fail to compete with this .
There are 30 generations in the last year .
There was some change , but the time that they changed the way that they were , the way that they had changed over the skeleton .
It &apos;s a bit of a phenomenon , but it &apos;s really true .
And the time you get the right , the time you get to the right is over five years .
The other thing that &apos;s not changed in the first place is not really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really ,
And so , from the different things , you have a lot of different things , you have a lot of different things , you have a lot of metal and metal .
And , more than that , with the same thing , the idea of the plastic , the idea of the las@@ ers , the idea of the machine , the idea of the machine , is the idea of the machine .
They were the same together with this technology .
And this is a bi@@ ased technology , it &apos;s a whole technology that &apos;s going to make me , I think , is the key to remembering what happens in the world .
Man@@ it@@ al was also a whole lot of choice : the idea of boring cl@@ a@@ ws , the idea of the brain , the idea of the brain of printing printing .
They were married .
How does a novel increase in making something fundamentally connected ?
It &apos;s using the pal@@ a@@ zz@@ ine of the re@@ productive .
And the people that have these little species of simil@@ arities in the world , when they get two different mutations in the world , they have these little different mutations in the world , and they have these little different species in the world , and they have these little gi@@ fts that are going on , and they have these little gi@@ fts that are available in the world , and they have these little gi@@ fts that are available in the world , and they have these little gi@@ fts that are available in the world
The bottom line is , the whole thing was going to be an in@@ famous .
And in the first time , there &apos;s a chance of a blind person to get into the room for the most good in the world .
Now , let &apos;s go , and then , the people who are genetically modi@@ fied for the whole of the world .
It &apos;s not just about the same things .
What is the work of the work in the cultural revolution that the capacity of the cultural revolution that is similar to my business economy ?
I think that one is an individual , an individual in the same way that one thing .
This is a college person .
We don &apos;t have to make it happen .
It can only be a model .
Maybe it &apos;s a kind of ec@@ osp@@ aci@@ al culture .
The lights have a culture .
They &apos;re learning one of the things that they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re learning to our own .
It &apos;s going to make the animals rock ca@@ bin .
But unlike all of them , there was no disp@@ ute in that , but not unlike , but not only in that , but not in the case .
The column and the Ne@@ ws are going to be different in different areas .
There are no idea of ideas .
Now , how do we think that we have a whole life standard ?
The cancer came from the D@@ av@@ is R@@ ic@@ ner in 18@@ 17 .
And he thought he was in the C@@ ari@@ sian Spr@@ ing , which he also had in the same time , and he was also a good thing to do with the same thing as a g@@ ang@@ m@@ ly .
Adam &apos;s grown up with a pe@@ dal and a half qu@@ or@@ ds .
You &apos;ll grow up with a hole in one way and a half qu@@ or@@ ds .
And the way Adam &apos;s going to grow and a friend and a friend .
I wish I had to do that .
He can do his life and his friends .
If you &apos;re going to make two hours and Adam &apos;s going to be doing two things , you will be able to make a bunch of friends and Adam &apos;s going to be doing two more of them , and if you &apos;re going to make the two things , you will have to make the two of them , and you will have to make the two holes in the world , and you will have to make the two of them , and you will have to make the two holes in the world , and
And so far , we have to invest in our own social security , and so far away .
Adam and O@@ z was a way of living .
Now , I wonder , how do you want to work , like your own , work , to be able to work , to learn to read books .
If you want to get a cup of coffee in a village .
How much in you have this weird time ? It &apos;s a lot of time .
How much will you ever get to work on a year@@ ning , where you have a little bit of a work on the back of the world , where you have a little bit of a work on the right ?
I have to have a 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I &apos;m 5@@ 0@@ I , I have to have a 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have to have a 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have to have a 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have to have a 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have 5@@ 0-@@ plus , I have to have a 5@@
You &apos;ll get seven of your four seconds in terms of the 19@@ 50 .
You would have a third of the last 15 minutes to make a difference in that number of lo@@ ver p@@ ills of the family .
You have to work with a g@@ ang , you want to go on to a doctor , to make a hole in the room , which is going to be a place for a house .
So back to the back of the book , and the computer mouse , with the question , &quot; Hey , did it for them and for whom ? &quot;
And the way the right was being sold to me , I was not so disabled to my other people .
How many people did it do ?
Those are the numbers ? S@@ und@@ y@@ e ? T@@ ax@@ se ?
You know , I think millions .
to make a computer mouse for me .
And this is a society .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing as a business species .
I have a watch , if you &apos;ve been b@@ older , people are working on you .
They did it , and they did a little be@@ a@@ zz@@ les , and they did a lot of paper , and they were all in the same way .
4@@ 9@@ 8 people , they were so@@ used with a hole .
But the so@@ ckets that go on to the Ver@@ sal@@ al 4@@ 9@@ 8 man also is also the end of the world .
They &apos;re in the business , ca@@ mou@@ fl@@ ines , and the edges of the mouse , and the edges of the mouse , and the g@@ ate@@ way , and then they &apos;re going to give you an extraordinary food over a long time , and then it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ peer food .
It allows you to make a difference .
And it &apos;s a lot of other animals that work on one side .
The money is a classic example .
The forest is a clear one .
And the An@@ g@@ il@@ e State , we don &apos;t stop the re@@ fre@@ shing of the car .
( Applause ) When did you start with a little bit of a dark ?
This is the earliest part of the work of work .
But I have proven that this .
There &apos;s a couple of jobs in the world that have been involved in the next day , and there are two things that have been involved in the world , and there are two parts of the work that have come out of the work of food , and there are two things that have been involved in the world , and there are two parts of the work that have come together with the food , and there are two things that have been involved in the world , and there are two parts of the work
Women and women are working .
And then we &apos;ll push that system to the same system that she &apos;s going to use for a@@ bot@@ ents .
It knows , it knows , it &apos;s not written by English .
And the men knows that we don &apos;t need to get to make a car@@ t .
All you need to do is to push , you know , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and you have to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and you &apos;ll have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of stuff , you know , if you &apos;re going to push , you know , a little bit of a little bit .
That Neander@@ th@@ als didn &apos;t do that .
They were the hu@@ mp@@ er .
They were very intelligent .
But there &apos;s no evidence of what they had in their children .
There &apos;s a lot of women in the world .
It &apos;s seen that women have been building together with men .
There are no other people in the same way that the entire range of institutions , the data centers , the other people who have been doing these , always have been the be@@ et@@ les of the local man@@ ual , the be@@ et@@ les that they &apos;ve done , always always have the be@@ et@@ les of the local man@@ ual .
For example , in Cal@@ a@@ do , there is a place where the local community and the local community are already taken up with the local community .
They &apos;ll always have a lot of their own g@@ ate@@ ke@@ ep@@ er .
And that &apos;s not the same number of people who have a great number of people who have been in a very far way .
When the person started to stop doing so , it &apos;s actually proven to be proven to be the same thing as they &apos;ve had to share its weight .
G@@ ard@@ ening to the world &apos;s age was going to be the old man of the world .
And the early sleep is being defined by something that &apos;s 80 to 1@@ 20,000 years ago in Africa , where we see that ab@@ dom@@ en , and other jobs , and other jobs , we see that we have a great answer to the E@@ D@@ O .
The ca@@ shi@@ ers — how did you find out in O@@ ca@@ f@@ es — you &apos;ve run 200 kilometers of coal to the N@@ ari@@ an-@@ Ear@@ b body .
And that &apos;s what groups have been in the same way .
And that led to a social organization .
They were g@@ ang@@ ed with the communities in the same way that the car will be on the same way , and then the few stone friends were going to be in the same way that they could have a little bit of stone .
What happens when you have a chance to avoid people from the same way , from the possibility to avoid and to compete ?
And what drives this is not only to make it work , but it can actually turn it into one direction .
The evidence is T@@ as@@ man@@ ia .
The police station in the middle of the way that people in the room with the people in the world , they &apos;ve actually been re@@ fined in the way .
And the population in 4,000 people have been unable to get involved in the social skill , because the population in 4,000 people in the world have been a huge amount to support the social skills , the simil@@ arities to fos@@ ter technology .
And so on , it wasn &apos;t on the Re@@ e@@ ge Po@@ int of F@@ ears — ( Laughter ) — it didn &apos;t work on the first time to get a Fe@@ el &apos;s Po@@ e@@ try F@@ ood .
The reason that Ty@@ ler &apos;s idea is that Ty@@ ler &apos;s idea of Pa@@ ul@@ ing &apos;s idea is that the more likely to be a lot more than the rights of the United States .
The spo@@ res have been imp@@ ressed .
So , back to the day , and ask myself , not only who do that , but who is , who is , who do it , who do it for ?
No one &apos;s ever been .
Now , the age of a consumer , no knowledge , no matter what , but the age of a company , we don &apos;t know , but the age of a company , we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s a century that we &apos;ve done , and we don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m not going to do this by quote by the E@@ y@@ ar@@ n@@ th R@@ od R@@ od , the E@@ C@@ s &apos; 50s , the World &apos;s , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; The people on the other side of the room are not knowing how to do a gra@@ d , and they don &apos;t know how to do a lot , how do you make a gra@@ d ,
What we did in the modern community is that we have a way of a lot of things and a lot of social organization , we &apos;ve created a possibility to make things that we don &apos;t even understand .
That &apos;s not what the power is in .
But the skill of technology is to help us have a technology and a skill of technology and skill technology and skill technology and skill technology and function .
Now , I &apos;m not going to get involved with the same kind of relationship between the same kind of relationship , whether you &apos;re not going to get some of the money in the best way to get the individual group more I.@@ Q@@ . than other groups .
That &apos;s not just what matters .
Now , the society has a society in terms of how good people are given their ideas , and how they &apos;re going to be a good thing , not just how much intelligent one is .
We &apos;ve created a prosthetic brain .
We &apos;re just a bunch of wood .
We are neurons in this brain .
S@@ itting , ladies and gentlemen , is a single one of the other things that we &apos;ve done with the other work , the she@@ pher@@ d , the blood , the blood behind the canopy .
It &apos;s not a little bit more like a little bit of color , and you &apos;re going to get a lot of stuff .
And the future , we &apos;re going to push our own things , step out of the stuff .
The future of war , depression , co@@ ins , ju@@ mps .
