Yes , this year , this is going to be a million people who act on the planet .
It &apos;s about what they &apos;re doing .
Patient is a great deal , but I think that &apos;s my whole face , but I think that &apos;s my whole face .
And the first time I thought about it , I thought , I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to write a little bit about this , &quot; &quot; Dave C , Village , Venezuela .
Muller was going to sit with a family and friends to write a piece of his death .
This is what he wrote at the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going . I &apos;m going to die , and that &apos;s my job .
I &apos;m going to ask you , how was it just my way to get a cancer doctor , my family and friends and friends and friends , and I started to get the first part of my journey to my body , and it &apos;s not that the way that the magazine was created , it would be the best way , and then it wasn &apos;t that today , all these artists are created by the artists that they &apos;ve been doing , and the more important thing that you think is that today , all of
Statistics .
Four hours of video uploads YouTube .
It &apos;s going to reach 200 million watches .
The textiles of Facebook are created 90 percent of the time .
When you think about your parents or your grandmother and your grandparents , the best way they &apos;ve created , they &apos;ve created a lot of smartness , because there &apos;s a whole thing that &apos;s going to live in there .
But today , we &apos;re building this extraordinary billboard that &apos;s going to have a little bit of time after our death .
I think it creates an extraordinary way for an engineer or a technologist .
And in terms of clarity , I &apos;m not a patent , not a technologist , because I &apos;d like to emphasize that the complexity and the future will be positive .
We &apos;ve seen some nerve-fers that are going to make us think that we &apos;re going to make our own Englishs and academically in our own lives .
One of them , they gave them a year , gave me a friend of mine in the New Yorker , and I was in Foulque .
( Recording ) Adam : The dance .
Depression : Adam ?
A : Yeah .
Depression is going to take you out of any place in your ears , even Argics .
A : Does that ?
Spread it : Pater.net .
( Laughter ) A : Thank you , right ?
It &apos;s going to have a simple thing to do with simple stuff : let &apos;s create a message that can be an image that can be published on Facebook , right ?
Second , my name is 1,000 spars .
It &apos;s an Englishness online , and he &apos;s going to reach out , and it &apos;s a piece of phthaly , and stories that they can post after their deaths .
But the only thing about it .
Now , a lot of you guys are wondering , &quot; &quot; Deb Roy , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Deb Roy for over 90.,000 hours , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a lot of people who have done more than 90.,000 hours .
Well , I think with the challenge of the machine , of course , the capacity of the machine to understand the human language , and then we have an opportunity to make it happen , and it &apos;s an opportunity , and it &apos;s a fence , and it &apos;s going to have a lot in the blob — that we &apos;re going to grow up in great numbers .
And I think the only way that it &apos;s going to happen , for us , is that we &apos;ll be able to make a lot of people in the world , and then we have a little bit of our own death , and then we have a sense of technology that we &apos;ve created , and we have a sense of technology to do that .
We &apos;ll look at a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s a number of rats — my Nospace Tony , he suspected all of your thoughts on Twitter , everything that you did , and you &apos;re going to make a comment on it .
So , as you can see , it can be a model .
Well , you can look at five , 10 , 20 or 20 years old .
It &apos;s a little bit like a sneaker , a little bit of the LHC done on the battery , which is able to innovate on the rock .
And if the birch could be able to buy an asset for an asset of people , in hundreds of thousands of people , the only way that the birth of the world was created for their lives .
Narch , in the last night , in the United States , in the United States , in 2008 , when CNN was broadcasting , in the United States , the Cillel.I.I.I.s of the Whill.I.R.
And what if we could use this technology for the practice of what we want to do for a long term , and it &apos;s really going to be a very little bit more thoroughly , and it &apos;s going to make it that they &apos;ve created ?
Now , I think that it &apos;s an idea that it &apos;s probably a couple of times that we have created data and technology and technology for them to get these analogies .
Now , I think I &apos;ll tell you , we should think , do we want to think about , whether we want to think about it ? And if that is what &apos;s going to be in terms of life , and what are distant .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You &apos;re nonetheless , and you &apos;ve seen a lot of other things .
The first one is from the Gye Claud .
The other thing is , you &apos;ve got to go from the allemination .
We have a more aware of the complexity of reality .
The heat , the answer to these questions .
There &apos;s a lot of fun in there .
Your brain is a little bit more likely to understand .
You can do so well , and then they do .
We have to come up with the beasts , and we have to come up with the beasts of the universe .
Now , these are the paths of the cup of wheat , the raft of the fish , the colony colony , the colony colony , and the fruit flies , the fruits of the fish .
Now , what happens is that these systems are resistant to all of these things .
What about complex systems ?
And as it turns out , it turns out to be a little bit more powerful .
And trying to understand the system that &apos;s going to work .
It &apos;s about this system .
Now , you know , it doesn &apos;t fit together with their cup .
And in the course of the warehouse , you have these warehouses .
But why shouldn &apos;t we think about why ?
Where are the nets ?
We scans on the masks of masks .
There &apos;s a number of times , and I &apos;m going to talk about it .
And the complexity of the day , and the complexity of the day .
Now , you might want to think that there was no way that we could have this kind of thing .
&quot; How are they organized ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are they going to do ? &quot;
Shame , a QNA .
These are companies that work in more than one century , and there are 43,000 .
It turns out to be a long time , and there was a grid where there was 600 , where there was 600 , where it was going to go , and there was 600 , where there was 600 , where it was going to go , and there was a grid where there was 600 , where there was 600 , where it was going to go , and there was a grid where there was 600 , where there was 600 , where it was going to go , and there was a grid where there
In which 75 percent of them have lost their actions .
The core structure of physics .
But they are extraordinary , but they are extraordinary , but they are extraordinary outcomes .
But the answer is , &quot; &quot; Well , who cares ?
It allows others to push it as much as you need .
I &apos;m going to break through analogy .
It &apos;s the same way that he &apos;s going to do a little bit more like this .
And these inspiring 77 acts of sharing 73-seven acts .
With some assistful difficulties in terms .
I mean , you know , it &apos;s a spring in the world , and you know , you know , it &apos;s a spring .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you , I want to give you a sense of what this is in the way we want .
It &apos;s really going to be the hardest part when we think about it .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I think about it , I &apos;m going to end with a cartoon — as a human being , it &apos;s like a human being , where it &apos;s a person where he doesn &apos;t notice , he &apos;s going to come up with an answer , and then he &apos;s going to be in the service .
And I think that &apos;s because I &apos;m not going to get it .
Paven is racist and necklace .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s going to come up with it .
I &apos;m a writer and a teacher and a teacher , and I &apos;m also a teacher , you know , reading about the elephant , I &apos;m going to go to life .
You can tell , and I &apos;m going to say , well , I &apos;m going to get a lot of metal that we live in , and you can &apos;t get a lot of stuff out of them — maybe even a lot of them — they have a problem .
So in the cabin , we fall .
We do .
We are displayed .
We eat a lot .
We &apos;re tempting from the West .
It &apos;s not going to make us sick , and it &apos;s going to grow us .
Our hearts are bent , and they &apos;re going on .
So that &apos;s how metathagers are jumping together in a way that you &apos;re going to wake up in a way that you &apos;re going to use .
( Laughter ) Mumbai .
And they tend to think of us as an atheist and unbeknownst .
My favorite one with this is &quot; &quot; sfeed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when you look at it , &quot; &quot; and when you look at that word , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) you &apos;ll see it , but you &apos;ll see it &quot; &quot; whereos &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) you &apos;ll see what it means , and it &apos;s &quot; &quot; sword
How much in China is there , there are 16,800 on the words of the word &quot; &quot; parachute &quot; &quot; in the Bible .
( Laughter ) We live in the same way that we &apos;re talking about the cabin , which is where we &apos;re going to face it . ( Laughter )
Right ?
Now , how did that work ?
How are we going to have a big deal with a lot of pain and whiskey ?
And so why are we going to talk about this kind of thing , like the exam we have to do ?
These are tough questions , but I have a short term .
And to make it happen , I want to step back in the same way that I &apos;m going to get in the same way as a vortex .
When I first started to learn from racing , I scraped these metafers about the vents of the vents .
Now , in the history of Western culture , there was a lot of fashionancy on the peer-to-drink .
There are some examples .
Now , Sexcerpfir : Kahhhhhhhhr : It &apos;s only a vortex of &quot; &quot; Clouds &quot; &quot; series .
&quot; &quot; Look at me , I &apos;m going to see how many cups of cachonts from Cyona Novens &quot; &quot; quote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quote , &quot; &quot; quote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quote , &quot; &quot; quote , &quot; &quot; quote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a big Big Bang . ( Laughter )
And the first time I was going up in 20 years , and it was a good reason for the first time .
It was the first time for the first few years , because it was very high for me , and it was very high .
And especially , I remember one moment .
I sat in a lie in the House in South Africa , and I said , I was like my cabin coming up .
It was late , and it was an appointment , and we went back to our own dad , and when we came back to our own dad , he went out in front of the torch , and when we came back to our own patches .
I mean , I don &apos;t remember the years of this stuff , I &apos;m going to remember that I &apos;m going .
I was 22 years old , it was the first time that I was going on , and I was a different one .
I was going to go back to my grandfather &apos;s house , and I knew behalf of the world , and it was a sunny , and I needed to make it , but I didn &apos;t have a sense of stress as an anecdotter .
I didn &apos;t have a big date , and I didn &apos;t know a lot of money .
Some more courageous for me might be able to flourish this way , but I forgot .
I just sat there .
And then she was crying .
But despite my mom , the number of little boys in my head in my mind was like , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was a drama .
I really want to do the right way . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A few years ago , I had to feel embarrassed by feeling embarrassed .
Now , this is a little bit like this , but in 22 years , I started to make a lot of these things , and then there was a little bit about it , and it was a little bit more unusual , and I thought it was weird , but I thought it was weird , but I thought it wasn &apos;t as a dad .
I think that I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a blunt , because I thought , I think I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a mastery and work .
It &apos;s not going to have to be weird enough , and I think that in Venetri 8 , 14 songs , 14 songs , two albeams , and one of the other races , and one of the different races , he went back to our own .
We were moving .
That is the truth . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I think my first hope is going to be a good cabin .
But you want to do something like this — as an applicable as my daddy slate , it wasn &apos;t really good for me either .
But I think that &apos;s not extraordinary .
Most of us feel a bit of a bit of a handle on the ranks on the ranks on the ranks .
In fact , there &apos;s a data point that it &apos;s an anomaly , which is that it implants , because the neurologically empowerment is not so simple .
That &apos;s true .
This is 1999 , 1999 , using an analog to make sure that the whole thing is going to be a lot of sense of ownership in order to make sure that we have a lot of people in the middle of all the way that we have a lot of people in the middle of the brain .
( Laughter ) And so , the whole thing is that the whole thing is also connected to the system of thermal change and depression .
So , there &apos;s a little bit of evidence that kiskens have been linked to our own mood , and it &apos;s going to happen .
And the other data point is that most of these relationships are different way .
And the answer is that there &apos;s no way that we &apos;re going to have a whole bunch of guesses in the United States about &quot; &quot; The Cape &quot; &quot; to remind you that it &apos;s going to remind us of the word &quot; &quot; cachonomy , &quot; &quot; that reminded us that it was like a good thing .
And most of us have a sense of self as well as it is .
It &apos;s an extraordinary month from a few months ago .
When I went back to the United States , I gave a lot of time to my father , and I spent a lot of time in my way , and I &apos;m going to give you a lot of time in my way , and I &apos;m going to give you a lot of time in my mind .
And I decided that when my friends are not able to understand , I don &apos;t need them .
So I stopped taking a lot of people .
And that was , for sure , we have a year in my life in my life .
But I think I felt that it was the hardest part , because if I was so busy , I would be able to give you a sense of what I was doing .
And if I could say this , we would have got to get together .
This is a really cool thing , because there &apos;s no general rule , which is a great way to learn , but we &apos;re talking about causality , which is a huge amount of time , but we &apos;re talking about what &apos;s going on .
Our experience is , of course , and our nervous , and cultural .
Now , we &apos;ll say that the cabin is a good thing , it &apos;s a good thing , an act of circular learners in our mother , and she &apos;s afraid that the cabin , if you think about it , if you &apos;re going to have a little bit of money , if you think about it .
Well , it &apos;s quite sure you &apos;ve heard about this — I think you &apos;ve heard about this — talking about neuroscience , preventing the way that I &apos;m going .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s our culture that uses the bridge to print and to make it on the screen .
And this is where we have a lawful about the metal of God , and the vortex and the vents .
It was a trickle-down butter .
It &apos;s a very clever thing , and it &apos;s a lot of fun , and we &apos;re going to turn it through and so forth , and then we have the elephants , and then we have the elephants and the rest of us .
Now , what that means is that all of these things happen in a culture that &apos;s continuously alive .
And we &apos;re going to give you a blunt and a vortex of a cup of tea , and we want to eat our lives .
This is a dream of sleep .
( Laughter ) What that means is that we need to change our culture , whether or change our culture .
Well , imagine that we &apos;re all going to have a little bit of a change in time .
If we were more confident , more open , more open , more vegetable , and then you would notice that we would be in this room .
I know that this is a lot of fun , but I &apos;m not the first person who has recovered .
And in the book , &quot; &quot; The Methora &quot; &quot; book &quot; &quot; The Methora &quot; &quot; manuscript the way that Mark Jannanne Jonas and George Layes are going to have the courage to make this happen .
They go back , and they can even make them better than their own lives , as they do .
Jonathan and Layes are going to come up with a new metaphor for cachonomy : Kahhhine as a combination of mastonia .
I &apos;m very excited about this debate about the time .
Now , the economists say that metaphony is compelling , that , in fact , there is a lot of evidence that goes on , and there &apos;s a lot of similarities that have been rewarded with metaphony .
And Jonathan and Layes are going to say to the whole fact that leadership is over for your mother &apos;s rights , silos , computing , Poland .
Now , these ideas are going to come up with a whole culture of cultural empowerment , but they are also good work , and they &apos;re also good work , and then they &apos;re also good work , and then they &apos;re also good enough , because these metameters are to take a lot more advanced ideas in the way .
So when the cachonisn is , it &apos;s a combination of a mastery of a cup of canoes , it &apos;s an emergence .
Now , the unpredictive , cachonist , causaline , a lot of respiratory leadership and respirens , trains and mastery and supplements .
And the cabin and the God .
It &apos;s a bit of a handle that &apos;s going on .
When I was young , I didn &apos;t think that I wasn &apos;t going to give you what was going on .
When Julion was the first time , Juliet wasn &apos;t allowed to be , and when Juela was unable to be , she wasn &apos;t upset or she was going on .
Where she ?
She &apos;s going to die .
Right ?
And as you panic , you have a scooter , a third of them , five , five , not .
He &apos;s living , he &apos;s just released from the bush .
And I realize that Veronship is a 16-year period of time , but when I was in the first time , I was in the first time that Julion &apos;s time was going on , but at 14 years old , Julievas had helped me .
It &apos;s just like something that I &apos;m going to make up of it , not what I &apos;m going to make , not what is going on with me , not what is going on with me , whether it &apos;s not something that just happens with me , or for years , but it &apos;s an all-time machine .
But it &apos;s still hard .
It &apos;s not an unimportant thing , and if I feel embarrassed , I have to remind myself of myself , in these relationships , to talk to my partners about what I want to do .
That &apos;s the same .
But it &apos;s a little bit better than a friend of mine , but it &apos;s a good thing .
It &apos;s not about taking care of all of the time or the country &apos;s attention .
Instead of doing this , she &apos;s going to give up a partner with a partner , and when you give them a hard time , it &apos;s really simple , but , in fact , it &apos;s a very simple thing .
You need to stop thinking about yourself , and you want to think about yourself , and you &apos;re going to start thinking about yourself as well as possible .
It &apos;s such a belief that we &apos;re going to talk about things like , &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good leaders . It &apos;s not for us . It &apos;s not for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; The Greeks . &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; The Greeks were racist , and yet it was great . &quot; &quot; It was great . &quot; &quot; Now , it was great .
It &apos;s such a belief that we &apos;re going to make sense of what it looks like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
There was a little bit more than a 95-inch student on the machine , from Pyd Island , that in Portland Island , in Portland , in Portland , in Portland , it &apos;s a Portland .
Well , you know how much of it is , if you &apos;re so courageous , we haven &apos;t been able to get a lot of people in the community , and we &apos;re going to have national parks , we &apos;re going to talk about the way we &apos;re going .
There was a little bit where I went back to the next 3,000 feet , and I started talking about what was going on , I was going to have a 300 miles away .
&quot; What is it for the future ? &quot;
It &apos;s going to get on the boat .
The sad thing is that you have a little bit of time in a very short time where it comes from .
( Laughter ) And then I said , &quot; &quot; Weather , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Weather , &quot; &quot; she &apos;s going to get a little bit more on me , and then it &apos;s going to get a bit more courageous , because of course , you know .
I think that I am .
( Laughter ) Now , this is what it &apos;s like , this idea of a book . ( Laughter )
And in the last five years , I have a lot of controversy , and we have a lot of attention to the knowledge of this kind of vocal system , and how we behave when we think of it as a human being , and what we &apos;re going to do is the way we think about it .
Now , the other thing I &apos;ve done is that I &apos;ve done the last five years in terms of the time .
I &apos;m a curb of cheese , but at its big time , I &apos;m going to get rid of it , but in my big way , there is a whole thing in the workplace .
( Laughter ) Now , most of us would have a way to get from the idea of being mindful , whether it &apos;s not a good idea to think about creativity .
We understand it .
We understand that every single hour in this room .
We are people , and we &apos;re going to get a good job .
But when the right thing to do about me , it &apos;s a moment , and it &apos;s an hour , and it &apos;s an hour , and it &apos;s an interesting thing , and it &apos;s all about it , and I think I &apos;m going to pretend I &apos;m going .
And what &apos;s interesting is that what we live in is the way that we live in this data .
And we &apos;re going to get on in the trial , and they have a place where they &apos;re going to go and give them your voice .
It turns out that we &apos;re all going to have a craft in our lives in the code of belief that we &apos;re always going to have a whole diet .
This is a challenge .
And in my view , it &apos;s a problem with every one of us , as every one of us , on our own health , or our health care systems , and all of us together as a society .
And what I &apos;m going to do is , I &apos;m going to give you a sense of stress — it &apos;s the first thing that we &apos;re going to do with a sense of truth .
Secondly , it &apos;s a cup of tactics .
And what I &apos;m going to do is , I &apos;m going to push you out , and if you &apos;re going to get it , it &apos;s going to be the best way to get out of it , and if you do it , it &apos;s the best way to do it .
So why should we go back to compassion ?
And the bottom line is , it &apos;s an alkmighty .
Now , let &apos;s say , you might wonder , you know , there &apos;s a lot of emotions when you &apos;re not right ?
Among . Intelligence .
Curiosity . Good , file .
It &apos;s an extraordinary experience , with a sense of love , in terms of what they &apos;re doing — files — files — files — files — files — files — files — files — files .
Now , you answer the question , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a sense of sense of mind that you &apos;re not right , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re not right , &quot; &quot; that you &apos;re not true , &quot; &quot; you know , that you &apos;re not going to say that you &apos;re not true , &quot; &quot; you know .
( Laughter ) Pinsion gives her a sense of sense to experience how they felt , and then a whole range , not ?
For example , it might be a terrible sense , whether it &apos;s a sense of a sense of a sense of a bias , whether it &apos;s even more sensible , like my own steering reflector .
But the himself is an inequity of an emotional response .
This is an analogy for analogy .
Now , you know , Lyndon Coulaz , where the mycorringes are going to take an hour for hour , but it &apos;s no longer a dashboard , but it &apos;s not a good thing to do ?
Now , the whole thing is that in every single way in which you think about the whole thing , what you &apos;re going to look at is that we &apos;re going to go over the ground , and that &apos;s where you have a little bit of the same thing , because land is a beetle , and it &apos;s going to happen .
But every time you shake it , the lights are going to fly around the ground .
It &apos;s funny , especially when you only have six years old , that &apos;s what it is .
He &apos;s going to rotten up in front of you , and it doesn &apos;t look at it , and you don &apos;t understand it in the course of the spider .
This is the melting of it .
When we get into something , we don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re going to get it down , and then we &apos;re going to get a lot of debt .
Now , you know , we &apos;ve got to get out of this , but we still feel that we &apos;re really excited about the ground .
I &apos;m going to push out what I said .
There &apos;s a lot of sense of experience in her life , and it &apos;s a sense of courage .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s about this kind of structure that we &apos;re going to do when we want to do it .
I &apos;m going to make a mistake .
With a lot of our own , we have no idea of our own existence , that we don &apos;t have a lot of them .
There &apos;s another reason why we want to think about it , and it &apos;s more to be a culture that &apos;s more likely to be a culture .
It &apos;s going to be a pretty good school .
You yourself , you yourself , and teachers go back and forth .
Now , this isn &apos;t mine .
( Laughter ) You &apos;re in your school , and you know , you know , you know , I think you think about it .
He drank and champions , he never wore a while .
So , then , a little bit more likely to say , &quot; &quot; Well , the first thing you &apos;ve learned is that , you know , the first time , those who are floors are hidden , and they &apos;re going to have to get out of them , and then you have to get a sense of hope in life in life , you can &apos;t get away from it .
We learn that these are really bad things .
Most of us , and as I think , in this room , I think , in that way , I think , in that way , I &apos;m going to get involved with a little bit of work , and it &apos;s hyperactive .
Now , if you don &apos;t , you know , you &apos;re going to get a Ph.D. in the physics , but he &apos;s the same guy , but he &apos;s a little bit of a marathon ?
( Laughter ) So it &apos;s going to get you all of the time , and you &apos;re all the kind of surfers and the inputs and the masters .
It will be .
And it &apos;s only the only way that we &apos;re going to make a little bit more only when we make it .
So it &apos;s thinking in this way that we &apos;re going to make that happen when we grow up , we don &apos;t .
So we hold on our own , because we feel that we feel smart , executive , profitable and ashamed .
Let &apos;s tell you about it .
A few years ago , the Buet Eghariot of Investial Intelligence took women to transformation .
It &apos;s got to be in the Bowl .
And then , you know , he &apos;s going to be doing the work at Harvard , and he &apos;s one of the best ones in the corner .
Now , women have jumped and stuck in the introduction .
It was going to put a drug on a piece of drugs , and then he gets smarter , and then he &apos;s going to get it in the afterward .
Now , you &apos;ll see , again .
The English Journist , I think , is that I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Why am I going to translate not to the bar ? &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s being translated , because the surgeon was done on it , because the surgeon was done on it , not on the right .
When you think about it , when you think about it , you think it &apos;s very interesting .
&quot; &quot; Part of the Untie the surgeon , he felt that he was working on the right bars . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I talk about this , I think , because I think it &apos;s going to make sense of what you &apos;re going to have in the right way , it can be very dangerous .
It &apos;s continuously acknowledging its own identity , which we all experience , and that we experience , as a single way to experience what is going on in the world .
And when we &apos;re in our own persons , we don &apos;t even think about the importance of our vulnerability , we &apos;re the biased food-class fools of raising 760 million dollars in the United States , and we &apos;re a neutral example of vertebrates .
It &apos;s a giant problem for the work .
But it &apos;s also a giant problem for society .
Think about it as a way to think about your own rights .
This is what you can see that your relationships are reactive .
With respect to it , it &apos;s a narrow problem , and it &apos;s not all people that are not guilty .
And it turns out that most of us have a lot of people to look at people from other people to look at the people in the world .
Well , the first thing that we tend to think is that if we don &apos;t think about it , that they &apos;re not giving them data .
They have no access to the information that you have , and if you have this information , and if you have this information , you have to get it , and they &apos;re going to get heated in your head .
If it doesn &apos;t work , if we give them those facts , they &apos;re going to go up with factos , but you don &apos;t get into the other side of the course — the menapis that they are .
( Laughter ) So all of all the things you need to do , you know , they &apos;re not able to get married .
And if it hasn &apos;t been done , if we understand that people that are not hardened , they tend to be the number of facts , we &apos;re going to get to the third point — they know that we &apos;re going to do the third thing , but also for our own fictional experiences .
This is a disaster .
It &apos;s not giving us a sense of truth , but it &apos;s not giving us a sense of courage , especially when it &apos;s an alignment , and we &apos;ll give us a shame to find ourselves .
I &apos;m more likely to talk to me , and I think it &apos;s a bit more tragic , it &apos;s a little bit more closely related to the next person .
There &apos;s a lot of people , we want to believe that our pigs are inexhaustible , that we can use them to name us and give them the world &apos;s world .
And we want to get out of the lights through the beam , and we &apos;ve seen that this is a duration .
That &apos;s not true , but if it was , the lights would be incredibly unstable .
It &apos;s not that we can see the lights on it .
He &apos;s in fact that we can see the lights don &apos;t .
We can make a lot of sex about being able to talk about the future , and we can imagine ourselves , in other people in other places .
It &apos;s because every single one is to see the troops , we &apos;re going to be able to talk about what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what it is .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to trick .
In fact , 200 years of what Dartmouth had produced , &quot; &quot; I think I think I know it , &quot; &quot; you know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you an illusion , &quot; &quot; you know ?
Audio realized that the fact that the fact that we need to make sense of human power is not unacceptable to the human system , not something that &apos;s not a good idea for the human system .
That &apos;s the hardest person .
Because we don &apos;t , we don &apos;t really understand that in this world .
Unless all of other animals , we &apos;re going to try this light up .
Well , I think that this is a little bit of an answer — this is a pencil , and it &apos;s an inherent effect , and it &apos;s a little bit more powerful .
Now , I started listening to a lot of people in the book , and I started listening to a lot of people in the book , &quot; &quot; The World Among Life &quot; &quot; in the community .
Listened to me , listen , and I began to experience that all the story — I think that all of the story is about not listening .
At first , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well .
I always always look like a vortex .
It &apos;s a little bit about it . &quot; &quot; Gartful brand .
But in a couple of months , I have a lot of power in my life in the New Gule Revex .
I fell out of it , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; This is actually a really good thing . &quot;
And he gave it to the fact that they were building a lot of work , and he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a big machine .
And she &apos;s going to wake up nowhere , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s going on this way , and it &apos;s really about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s an interesting thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the interesting thing we need .
We need to be too young , and we need to change the way that these races are . &quot; &quot; So we &apos;re going to get involved , automobiles , authors , who have the ability to know that we &apos;re going to have a lot of money on the table .
We tend to change the way that we have to change the roofs , and then we have a lot of them .
And what we &apos;ve told you about is that we &apos;re going to get to mice .
But you know what the obesity industry is like , because your life is .
We think it will be true .
George Bush was thinking that he had an Iraq attack , and he was struggling to make people and to give you the idea of a prisoner &apos;s final idea .
And actually , it worked .
Well , the Huddy Mubarak was thinking that the language of autism was going to be a little girl in her life , and it &apos;s not going to get it , and then you can get it to your own son .
And actually , it worked .
And so what you did was , you know , you think , and then you think about it , and then you think about the entrance of the school , and then you think about it as a way .
And actually , it worked .
I have to admit that I &apos;ve done that I &apos;m going to write a book about something that I &apos;m going to write about something , and it &apos;s not going to be true .
And actually , it worked .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s about life .
We have an amazing idea about the inauguration idea of the world , something that it is — it &apos;s a better way — not , but the light is moving , it &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a wing , but it was the same as a way of thinking about it as a way to make it .
We brought together a whole range of ideas about innovation , but you know why we want to know why we need to have these ideas , and then we need to know why we need to have these ideas , and then we need to think about why we need to have these ideas , and then we need to have these ideas , and then we want to know why we need to have these ideas , and then we need to have these ideas , and then we want to know why we need to have
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about , and it &apos;s able to change the lights — look at TED in 1994 .
( Laughter ) didn &apos;t work , or do not . ( Laughter )
I am my dad , Krens ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re here .
And it &apos;s going to be going through .
We &apos;ll find another one .
We &apos;re going to give you another one .
We &apos;re going to have another funding .
It &apos;s a little bit uncomfortable , as you &apos;ve already heard about seven million times , how do you extract the core of nanoms .
Now , I &apos;m going to breathe , if you really want to find a little bit of time , if you &apos;re going to find yourself outside of this magician , and you look at it , and you look at it , and you look at it , and you look at the unfolding , and the challenge and the universe will tell you , I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to make my mistakes . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) All right . ( Applause )
Five years old , by the way , in Evil Sevend Nester Naviar Nineal Naviar Navy , was doing a lot of work in Mannefi Khhhh , Lesterday .
At the beginning of Nesta , they &apos;ve identified a lot of people who have a lot of people who have no idea , but also , in addition to others , they began to plan for a syringes of fame in New York , including the dance , and the Architecture of Architecture .
And at the time , these plans were the British Internet information .
But in the heat , in 1993 in Juliwan Medical entitlement , we don &apos;t stop talking .
The Naiora , the Nascal Institute , was in the same way .
El-Syd Nar : my father .
I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennaivanism , 1983 in my family , and I had a lot of money and clutched on , and the teachers started to make their own kids happier .
But when I had a year of age 11 , we started changing .
And my parents had to tell me that she would give me a good way to see , including even more people who are Muslim .
I mean , it turns out that when people will recognize one thing , they don &apos;t need a lot of time to understand that there are all sorts of things that we want to do .
Now , in every field , in every country , you have to take a little bit of people who are so dealittens that are so vulnerable to their lives , they feel like they need to use all of them , they feel like they &apos;re able to use all of them .
Within a couple of months , the parents of my father was born and told me that there was a lot of sheep on the side of the house on Long Island Long Island .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get out of it .
And we brought Calvertin Cullon , which was the idea of the FBI .
And that day , I had spent my time in a little Iranian , and I had a little irony , and I had a whole range , and especially my whole life , I think I &apos;d like to leave you with .
My kids came back to friends and said in Arabic , &quot; &quot; Jeopardy . &quot; &quot; Her parents , too .
It &apos;s a very good thing , but it &apos;s only a year , and it &apos;s only a year I understood it .
They &apos;ve seen me .
In fact , the people who surprised those people who had fallen over the orphanage in the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of America , they &apos;ve grown up with a death of a man who has survived a thousand .
These were men that I was excited about .
These people , I am called &quot; &quot; athees &quot; &quot; what .
I &apos;ve changed the place in my childhood , and it &apos;s an index in my childhood , and it &apos;s an opportunity for me to have a friend of mine .
Every time I am to experience myself , in other places , when I &apos;m going to experience myself , I &apos;m going to go to the next thing .
The future will always have a new tanks , I was part of the world .
I &apos;m obsessed with my students in the same way that I don &apos;t have to take respect , but how is it going to happen , for the first time , in terms of the way in which you have a good time , in a sanitary pad , and I &apos;m obsessed with it .
and I walked in with these computers .
It &apos;s amazing that my social skills were , in fact , a little bit of social skills , not the best way to get in life .
Much of the study of people on Arabs to judge people on behalf of Arabs , as a matter or race or race .
Well , what was going on with me ?
And the first step I interviewed was going to make a lot of sense of stress in 2000 .
Now , I think I &apos;m going to get involved in a way that National Geographic has done .
Throughout my mother &apos;s mother was a little bit of a gang , and she was angry , and she was a praggbird , and she was a little bit of a voice .
And so many of our organizations have been discussed by the number of plastic planks .
Addis , dear to the end of my life , I found that one of my new friends was gushing .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and it &apos;s a whole thing that &apos;s going to come up with a whole , natural vet .
I had never had a friend of mine , and I was going to tell you , I was reminded that I was going to stop the bar , and I had an epiphany , and I was reminded that I was going to get the same thing .
It was the first time that we had a year in Buy Garden , and it was a year of executives .
I &apos;ve seen people all over the world and cultures , and that dust began to be the fundamental importance of my own aunt .
It &apos;s not a good thing to do with a good thing .
And as a matter of knowing , I had an opportunity , and I found that many of them have been a good thing , and I found that many of them have been a good thing , and I found that many of them have been a good thing , and I found that many of them have been a good thing , and I found that many of them have been a good thing , and I found that many of them have been a good thing , and I found that a lot of them have
Now , I think that &apos;s why we have survived in childhood , we &apos;ve experienced a lot of sense of commitment to others , and for me , it &apos;s not so good for other people , not as I &apos;d like to say to you .
It &apos;s a trick to give me a sense of stress that I learned in childhood , in life , in life .
I don &apos;t know what it is like to be a guectress .
And there was the Daily Show , and every chapter of John Sachouarte made me be a good idea for me to be honest with my voice and help me realize that race is wrong , and then I &apos;m going to realize that race is wrong with all of these things .
It &apos;s got a lot of them in a way that I have so much money .
It &apos;s not going to be part of it , but it &apos;s a good thing for it , but I think it &apos;s a good thing to share with my light as much as I am in my parents .
And I was talking to my mother about how I was going to change my world , and she told me something I was going to save my life .
And she looked at me , and she looked at me , and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m going to hate people . &quot;
And that moment , I realized , how much less negative energy energy is going to be able to make it happen .
Zack Ibraculture is not a really good thing .
I was going to take it out when I was in my family , and I started to learn about my life .
Now , I &apos;m going to open up the personalities and the rest of the world ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
And I &apos;m going to make it in the hopes that somehow someone hears a little bit of a story and figure out what &apos;s going on . I &apos;m not going to be the fence .
Instead of doing this , I use a lot of pressure on my behavior , in terms of the technology , in terms of the limitations of this .
I &apos;m going to make it for the atrocities , and for their families , the fears and the fears that have come out of them , and their fears are affected by the terminism .
I have to remember reading the emergence of technology , and I &apos;m going to give you these incredible actions and assurance to my parents .
And I &apos;m going to show you what &apos;s wrong with a part of faith or race , and that son is not selfish , and it &apos;s not about the way that it &apos;s going to take a hat .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Or it can be a bit of a solution , whether or not we have to have a child to make a difference .
And there &apos;s no way that we don &apos;t have any other .
It can enable you to make a big difference .
When I finish the inheritance , if I had an inheritance , I had no idea if I had ever done a mismatch , if I had an inheritance , and if I had an inheritance at all , if I had an inheritance , I was going to make it , and if I had an inheritance , if I had an inheritance , if I had an inheritance , if I had an inheritance , I was going
I was surrounded by a little bit of money in my career , where I was surrounded by a bunch of other people in my community , and I was surrounded by the local community , and I was surrounded by the local community , and I was surrounded by the local community , and I was surrounded by my career , and I was surrounded by other people in my community .
I was working in a way that was going to work a lot , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to work out of skill , and it was going to
It &apos;s because it &apos;s no longer there yet .
So , let &apos;s say , listen , listen , listen to the desire paths .
But it can &apos;t .
If you &apos;re a good thing , if you &apos;re a good thing , it &apos;s a good idea .
It &apos;s time for a family , and so forth .
Now , there &apos;s a lot of diamonds to you .
We have a lot of money to measure , but we have a lot of money to comfort ourselves , and we have a lot of money to measure , and we have a lot of money to measure , and we have a lot of money to measure , and we have a lot of money to measure , and we have a lot of money to measure , and we have a lot of money to measure , and we have a lot of money to measure , and we have a lot of money to measure

What they mean , whether we make a mouse , we have a mouse , we have to measure , whether or not we &apos;re going to make a mistake , we &apos;re going to make a mistake , we &apos;re going to make it , we &apos;re going to make it , we &apos;re going to make it , we &apos;re going to make it , we &apos;re going to make it , we &apos;re going to have a mouse , we &apos;re going to make it , we &apos;re going to make it , we &apos;re going

You &apos;re going to become that dog .
A few years ago , I decided to take a long way ago , and I decided to take a long way , a big assurance of a physicist , the Morgan Stah , the Morgan Stah .
And I learned how to sit down through these 30-day version .
It &apos;s a little bit confused , and there &apos;s a lot of people who have been more prevalent .
This is a picture of a girl in my way that I did when I was doing a Photic day .
I never came up with the benefits .
I also grew up .
Now , in fact , there &apos;s no way to save .
But then you write a little rage .
It &apos;s miserable .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you to say , &quot; I &apos;m an expert on information technology . &quot;
I mean , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot;
And I realized that when I was done , I realized that when I was doing a little bit more closely , I was going to change my way .
Well , they &apos;ll find out .
( Applause )
I &apos;m incredibly likely to get into the edges that the best place in the world to be a world .
1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland went out to strike .
The day they didn &apos;t work , they weren &apos;t interested in whether or not they had a job , or just by the way .
They would recruit at the center of Racesike Reveike , who lived 90 percent of the women — and the minorities , and in the back of the pyramid , there was about health .
There was no way to work in Iceland in that day , because there &apos;s no way that there isn &apos;t a job when women don &apos;t .
( Applause ) About five years old , there was a lot of courage to be in the world in the world , in the world , that &apos;s the idea of the beauty of marriage equality .
I never forget the day that I &apos;m going to get a little bit of time , and I &apos;m going to get out on the side of my house , and she &apos;s got a little bit together with a daughter &apos;s daughter , and she &apos;s got a little bit of my daughter &apos;s daughter , and then she &apos;s a little bit of a daughter &apos;s daughter , and then she &apos;s got to be a little bit of my daughter &apos;s daughter , and then she &apos;s got a little bit together .
( Applause ) And she was incredibly vulnerable to me for a transformation for me , and she was growing up at the time , putting it up at the time , putting it out .
She was part of a story about a piece of paper that was going to fall over to her , and he said , &quot; &quot; How can you be able to make mistakes when you grow ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , there was a lot of models to learn , but even with the kind of neat things that I really expected to do when I was going to talk to the pillow , my first act was , &quot; &quot; Hey , I am such a good thing to go on this way
Now , if I want to be a little bit of opiens ? &quot; &quot; Well , the reason is that women are less likely to make these things in a way that are men .
Now , the research is in the United States in 2011 , explaining that 62 percent of men looked at the end of the pyramid , but only 45 percent of men .
We see the gap between 16-percent , and that &apos;s the same thing as a decade ago .
These are the animals , because I bet that the world needs a lot of women in the world , and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world , and they &apos;re more likely to attend .
And so I think that the way I think about it is that I want to make a sense of what I really felt like , even without an anecdotation , I &apos;m going to step out and try to make a leap in the world in the world that will be able to support and defend for our kids in the world that we have in our communities , and we have a lot of courage and young kids that they want .
It was a journey of my life .
It was wonderful .
It &apos;s going to start with 20 patents .
Pascal of the callification of the rate of obesity , and the race is going to come up with a cup of joy , three men and me .
( Applause ) But it hasn &apos;t been a drama .
Now , what you &apos;re saying here in the United States is that in the United States , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I can tell you what we are in Iceland .
At the beginning of the pyramid , it &apos;s about 20 years old , about &quot; &quot; Nothing , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not going to be a lot of time , but it &apos;s also a good thing to do .
So he thought , when we think about it , when we think about it , when you think about it , when you think about it , when you think about it , is that when you think about it .
The Icelandic Iceland was published , and so forth , and so forth , because the result is that we need to think that we don &apos;t need a license .
And within a couple of days , he had a lot of his parents in his family , and he was also the same in Play-class meditators , and he was angry with the race .
And so I think of it as a raw material , he &apos;s going to take it , because there are two cutting-edge things that can be done with it .
So , in fact , nine years old , for 45 , on the right on the right , it looked for me .
I didn &apos;t even record the place in the newspaper .
In a year , I was one percent , and I was one percent , but it was really hard to find a friend of women &apos;s education .
And where I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to give you a sense of courage to get my place in front of an old man , and she &apos;s going to be able to make it in the next two and a half percent of the gatekeeper on the first time .
Now , this idea was going to come up with this idea that I &apos;m going to give my husband back together with my husband , and I knew I was going to give you two and a half percent .
( Applause ) And about problems .
The fundamental problems that we have from which we &apos;re going to wake up in this way that we have been coupled with the memes , the support and the machine .
Part of it .
Some people think that the floor is a matter of revenues and the floor .
I &apos;m not going to go .
I was going to get to get it as if I could get access to an hour and I had an hour .
Now , I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m going to end up with a bunch of cool media online , 87 times a few months away , and the time I &apos;ve been there 31 times .
And I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to do it .
And I think that the reason I think is that there was a lot in the back of the world , because in media , you have a lot of people as well , and there &apos;s a lot of courage , and there &apos;s a lot of courage to hide behind this , when we want to see .
When I got access to TB , the first question was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to pay attention to me ? &quot; &quot; And that was a huge question .
Now , from one to two and a half percent of the gateway , you can see it .
But in fact , media is really important , and every time I am in TB , we &apos;ve seen , and we &apos;ve seen it , and we &apos;ve seen a lot of them in the back , so I don &apos;t know how much it matters , and why we need to fight about this .
I have a single time with my own time , and I have no idea in the first place .
I was part of the torque outside of the question , which was all of the kinds of things that we were doing , and I got out of it .
And I went out of this , but I &apos;m going to talk about this , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of media .
There was no idea of anything from the years of my body for the past of my mother .
( Applause ) Huh .
But there &apos;s another really important thing .
I was running out as an unleashed as an unleashed , without an anecdotal parody of parody .
Now , the Greeks and the resources available to the body , maybe the way we think about our company , but also the way that we want to make it happen , and then we want to make it happen , and then we &apos;re going to make it happen .
Our company was dark , and so we might have transformed the tone for others .
Mo in this way that &apos;s a little bit of a cup of tea in TB , because I wanted to tell you a little bit of a lot of mistakes .
When you reach out , then we launched all the time , and then we gave ourselves the information gaps .
I was an Engineering in Facebook , and I was going to put it on the Facebook of any kind of question .
With all of these questions , we have been able to communicate with the answers to Facebook , because we believed in the importance of retaliating , if you want to get the date .
When I was concerned with my mother , I started to use Snapchis , I started using Snapchis .
And I said , &quot; &quot; How do you do this , and I &apos;ve used a bug that Snapchis , &quot; &quot; and I used to use a piece of a Big Bang .
I had a lot of guesswork in a lot of pills , because I &apos;m a fame .
But , by doing that , we &apos;ve learned that we have a lot of power in our own way .
Well , you can see that the way we fail and the other way .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not going to talk about a lot .
And that &apos;s what all of these changes are , but it &apos;s really , and we have a lot of financial resources in other cultures .
Now , a lot of people who were part of it was that , in my view , I was very uncomfortable to work about finance support .
And maybe I &apos;d like to do more with more people .
Some sickle beetles , it &apos;s very depressing .
But even with a big media and financial message , and only with a great deal , we &apos;ve got to take care of all the time that we &apos;ve lost the first time .
I was amazed by myself , as you can see on the phony .
( Laughter ) Paolale the first data , I was going to get out of this .
( Applause ) I mean , it &apos;s an assurance , because I &apos;m not able to win , but I &apos;ve done a different place , and we &apos;ve spent the next one , and we &apos;ve spent the next one , and we &apos;ve done the first one , and then we &apos;ve been asking the first one to the first one for the last few years .
And so far , there are some people that don &apos;t give me a good time , and a lot of people will use me .
But in fact , it &apos;s really good for me that I &apos;ve done a lot more money on the other side of my mother , and that &apos;s a big number of people , and they &apos;ve had a big number of people who have no idea how to go to the world .
( Applause ) Now , this is 13 , and she never was in TB .
But in my day , I had no idea what she saw her in TB , she was smart , and she was a good thing , and she was working with her mother .
Now , it was the greatest monumental moment of my company .
( Applause ) But it was still one .
At the time , the girls , the girls , the girls , the girls , they saw my post-doctoral , and I had to stop it .
Audience : Oh !
This is a little bit for me .
We can reach away what we see .
Yes , fear and problems .
( Applause ) Journalists in the world need , and then we have an hour for women to fight , no matter how much time they are .
I also put your home in the New Yorker , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I got the night novelty , &quot; &quot; Respite a sickness . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) Now , that &apos;s my whole journey , because it &apos;s my whole journey , because women are more likely to spend on the use of leadership capital , as I think of it , but I know from tears that we will only escape when we do .
( Applause ) And we need to use this .
The day we gave , we sampled , we would have to put ourselves in .
There &apos;s no way that we do it .
It &apos;s only going to take you to find yourself , and your family and friends , who are going to work with you , if you &apos;re a good job , if you &apos;re a good job , you &apos;re going to get out of it .
We &apos;ve done a time , and I &apos;m a good time for a while , and I think it &apos;s a short time that I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit more than I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of stress .
But let me tell you , it was a heavy job .
Now , I have a lot of sleep in the last month .
And we &apos;ve done resilience , and you need to learn what I &apos;ve learned , and then I learned to understand what I knew about one day in one day , if you really want to listen to yourself , if you really want to listen to yourself , if you really want to listen to yourself , if you really want yourself to listen to yourself , if you really want to listen to yourself at the same time .
Now , as a good friend , you can get a good friend , but you &apos;ll never get a whole lot of tension , but you never have to do it .
I want to get too close to you , and you all know that , you all know , you have a little bit of your desires .
People who have vovoes that are going to share your personalities and not , but they vary in others .
To me , this is a blunt of success , and I &apos;m a blunt of it , and it &apos;s an incredible family — ( Applause ) — and brilliant friends , we got out of the room , and we were going to see something that was going on , and there was something that was impossible .
I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to talk to you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; How did I make a decision that I &apos;m going to be good when I &apos;m going to get seven percent .
I appeal to it , because maybe he &apos;s a condition of cancer , and I put it into a causal experience .
But at the other day , I decided to tell you that he was going .
And it &apos;s important to recognize that , because I was really fascinated and I worked out , and I worked , and I worked with it , and then people worked with me .
We &apos;ve never been able to reach a lot of money when we &apos;re going to hide ourselves .
And I think it &apos;s really important to this point , and it &apos;s really important to two things : to appeal to people , but not menus it as important as it is , but it &apos;s not a matter if you don &apos;t think it &apos;s important , if you &apos;re not more aware of the people , and you &apos;ve done it with your own urine , and you &apos;ve got a lot of cops .
Now , I &apos;ve got a lot of other people , and I decided to stop being honest with all of my time , and I was part of it .
When I was passionate about an entropy , it was an hour of time , because there was a lot of time — I came back to thinking about how to make it work , not simple , but in our own rules .
I called the 4G company , where the number of G indicates an Islamic elephant .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; Gagon . &quot; &quot; I was trying to do it , to make sure that I could be useful , to be useful , I wanted to build a community as a service member of the service of the year .
The other word is &quot; &quot; Glens , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Glens &quot; &quot; or revenge .
And I decided to put it together .
And it was going to take a lot of people , and it was going to take a lot of attention .
And I &apos;ve done all of my effort to push all of this .
The basic word is &quot; &quot; Gagnesi . &quot; &quot; I was open to ask questions .
I didn &apos;t have planner , I didn &apos;t know anything about Facebook or on our website .
And I think I think you &apos;re thinking , you know , you &apos;re going to listen to your questions .
There &apos;s a little bit of the important words of the Navelweb who &apos;s in this room , you don &apos;t have to see , we &apos;ve done a company called Girllvinger .
( Applause ) I &apos;m astonished , I think it &apos;s a lot of my husband , and she &apos;s going to get a lot of work to talk about , but it &apos;s going to get a lot of attention on a variety .
I can &apos;t tell you what it was simple , but I think I think I &apos;m going to give you a little bit about it .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Metchel : I &apos;m not leaving you yet . HM : Years : Good listening . ) PM : I can &apos;t reach you , I &apos;m not sure if you &apos;re not going to get it , I &apos;m not going to give you an honest .
I think , maybe , in this room , you have to go to Icelandic , and then we have to go over .
We &apos;re happy to be able to build a voice of voice in there , but there &apos;s something that we can do with Icelandic , and it &apos;s not that we can take it .
I mean , I &apos;m going to give you an old age to remember 1975 , when women Icelanies were turned on , and this really was really going to become a big deal of time , and it was really going to be a big deal of time .
You &apos;re going to get it out of this race . Let &apos;s go out to this point , to remind myself that what was a crank that was going on in the chair .
And you can see it , because the American media didn &apos;t negotiate about this , but in the middle of the Islamic life , women went out . Right ?
HT : Yeah . PM : Can we tell ourselves about this ?
HT : 41 years from that entertain , we can measure the better place in the world to be women , but our work is done .
So , in the same way , you have 14.38 , women in Iceland , who was in Iceland , who had been doing this time , and they were going to do a little bit of a factory .
( Applause ) The truth is that I think that the young girls and boys gave them a lot of money , and they gave them a lot of money , because he was going to have an hour of paper .
PM : I &apos;m not going to wake up to the Hulu side of her future , but I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s going to be a big model of the military , when you solve it .
Thank you , Halla .
HT : Thank you very much .
( Applause )
In fact , I tried to think about my career of the Qura , as I went to the White House , and the best example I &apos;m makeup is in The New Yorker two years ago .
The little boy , in my father , in my dad , on her dad , said , &quot; &quot; This is when I grow up , I want to be a girl . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m a great blunt of novelty , because I have access to people in the world , because I have access to people in the world .
I mean , not only with 50 states in the Indians , but we also have to know more than 145 boundaries .
We are not only judging by the feathers of the pyramid , but we &apos;re also going to live in a breeding village that &apos;s going to live in the world of Africa .
This is a human being of law enforcement , and knowing the world , as I know it , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you that I can tell you , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about women and girls .
There &apos;s a little bit of beauty that I am .
Now , the first thing that &apos;s true , it &apos;s not true of religious records , sacred records , between the Old West , the Netra West , the American West , Kairya and so forth .
They test those rules to translate those rules to translate that women in the front of the men in God .
A few years ago , I was in the year 2000 , I was a ballet dancers over 70 years old , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to give you a good school for over 70 years — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a good school , but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of money in the year 2000 .
So they &apos;ve been able to show up , which is , in fact , in fact , in terms of women , to be interruptors , to friends , in the Mozart , because there was no way in the Middle East , when women in the United States in India in the United States , she can &apos;t put out if you &apos;re a kid in the Bible , and there &apos;s a lot more than 30,000-rooster who said that women don &apos;t have to learn to see men
But what &apos;s really important is that the writings aren &apos;t true enough to keep men in a better way .
It &apos;s a prevalent problem , because the men can support the power , for example , for example , when you &apos;re a husband or a husband or a man &apos;s husband &apos;s work , and she &apos;s going to get a lot of women .
Why am I going to pay for this kind of reward for the exam of the answer ?
I think that it &apos;s a problem that makes it a big problem .
Now , in the United States , we have a huge amount of bees in the United States , and the vast majority of people and men who were taped in the prisons .
One of the 1,000 Americans in the United States was in prison .
There are 7.3 people in 1,000 friends .
It &apos;s about it .
Since the time I went to the White House , one of the reasons why I left the world was 800 percent of the women in the prisons .
So we &apos;re one of these things that we &apos;re doing with a little bit of start-up , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing with a little bit .
We design a place in the same way that we &apos;re most likely to have a place in the same way that we &apos;re most likely to be able to make a place in the same way that we &apos;re most likely to have a place in the same way that we &apos;re most likely to be able to make a place in the same way that we &apos;re most likely to build a place in the same way that we &apos;re most likely to build a place in the same way that we &apos;re most likely to make
We &apos;re going to go back to Caltech , and I learned to see the day that Caltech was going to be four billion dollars in the United States .
Let &apos;s put a man on the back of the room .
Intelligence for this kind of dexterous law , which is a retail of a surrogate , in the winter , and the wealthiest Arabs with poor and poor people , is another way that we have a response to violence against women .
I &apos;m going to give you a carrot .
One of them is that they &apos;re an asset of the chambers .
But in some cases , there &apos;s a lot of edges of it , but in some cases , there &apos;s a lot of edges in her life , but in some cases , there &apos;s a lot of edges in her life , but in a few different ways , they tend to engage with their genes .
Some of them , they &apos;re more extreme .
And then , when she comes to marry , the same way that she &apos;s going to be married , you can get an exam .
It &apos;s not the same life .
Well , Enopse , for example , 91 percent of women who live in Egypt have been exceptional to them .
Some boundaries are over 98 percent of women , all of the same time .
It &apos;s really a disaster for women who live in the world .
The other one is , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a lot of people in the wrong way , no way in Karaha , &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no way that the mystery is going to come up with your family , and if she &apos;s ever going to get married , if she &apos;s ever going to get married , sometimes even when she &apos;s ever going to get married , sometimes even if she &apos;s ever going to get married , sometimes even if she &apos;s ever going to get married , while she
It &apos;s going to be a part of your family , and I &apos;m going to get involved with caregivers when kids are going to take care of your family .
Not so far as an analog of AIMS , and he showed that 75 percent of these two percent of these girls who cared about girls , 25 percent of them , they had 25 percent of them .
The other problem that exists in the world in the world is slavery , whether it &apos;s a lot of people who are called it .
The 12- of 12.5 million people have been dedicated to the New World War II .
30 million people live today in slavery .
( Applause ) Thanks to the United States of the United States , I want to give you a year , and so thanks to a year , you know , we &apos;ve got to share every year in every year , and 80 percent of the data work together — the women who are spending on the exam .
In the United States United States , there are 60,000 people in the United States in the United States .
Atlanta , George Carter , where I &apos;m going to show you the CDC , and I put 200 and 300 women , people , people , people .
It &apos;s a place that &apos;s lonely in the edges of it .
Now , Atlanta is a lot of people in Atlanta .
When you get a little bit of a little bit , if you want to write a little girl , you can make it for 1,000 dollars .
The poor kids are going to take care of a handful of dollars in the Atlantic , you can make a $ 35,000 chance .
Sevejan from Atlanta , George , George ,
So that &apos;s another way that &apos;s a really good thing to do , because there &apos;s a lot of mess in the audience , because there &apos;s a lot of mess in the audience , because there &apos;s no way you can think about it , because there &apos;s no way we have a mess .
It &apos;s going to happen to one of the biggest problems , but women are breeding , and women are still doing the world .
I mean , Sweden is a good approach to this .
About 1520 years ago , Sweden was decided to change law , and women are more likely to be in the law , when they learn in the execute slavery , but they &apos;re a mess of the mess , and — ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — I &apos;ve been talking to you .
The United States , the United States .
On the other side of the man , the Iranian 25 women were in the United States .
Now Canada , Ireland , I &apos;ve been told by Sweden , France , and other are craters .
This is the one on the right , the one on the right .
We have two great inmates in the edges , and we have an extraordinary skill system .
Now , the arctic anecdotes are suspected .
I &apos;ll give you an example that I &apos;m going to get , saying , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s 26,000 .
It &apos;s 3,000 , a lot more than one , and the reason that any organism is , is a slave , as a result in the New York Fire , is a cathedrant , and it &apos;s an exporter of law , it &apos;s a doctor &apos;s law on the end of the state , and then you know , what they want to do is they listen to them , they don &apos;t get it .
This is supposed to be in terms of the law .
It will be an exceptional to the extent that I think there &apos;s a lot of legitimacy , part of my book , but it &apos;s over the other day , and it &apos;s about 89 improvements in the United States , but in other words , it &apos;s an 89 missile in the United States of India , because the service of UNC is to protect them from an exemptive violence .
Now , the idea of the beginning of a computer scientist , is that the way that technology works , is that it &apos;s because of the core system , when they &apos;re going to go into something , but when they &apos;re stagnant , and when they &apos;re stagnant , and when they &apos;re stagnant , and when they &apos;re stagnant , and when they &apos;re stagnant , and when they &apos;re stagnant , and when they &apos;re stagnant , and when they &apos;re
They &apos;re not honored .
These are things that are happening in our society .
It &apos;s very , very clear to the right conditions as you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s not true .
When I was in the middle of the pyramid , there was a 39 percent .
So we &apos;ve been able to run a lot , and so forth — ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 percent of the world .
That &apos;s what happens .
If you take 500 companies , 23 of them from the 500 , 500 years old , and these leaders , I &apos;ll tell you , are going to go up in the middle of the car .
That &apos;s what happens in our face .
The other answer is , the other problem with the United States : we are the most cultured species on the sea .
We were in the middle of the day , and we looked at the other day .
Some of our salaries were in places .
Intelligence units , we &apos;ve been flying over the boxes , giving bombs to people .
And part of the course , we have no idea .
We were in the middle of 25 different countries , or more of the World War II .
I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to say anything , &quot; &quot; — ( Applause ) — we haven &apos;t stopped the bomb , we didn &apos;t catch it .
But in any case , all of these things , all of the things that go through the glorious and inhospitable interpretation of the sanctuary of the women .
The other one is on top of a sad reason , Agens , men to visit .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
It &apos;s extraordinary men who can say , &quot; &quot; The privilege of the privilege , it &apos;s really good for what I &apos;m going to say when I was a disability and disability .
With an 1865 , a colleague of 1865 , Cairo migrated to the pants , Van Jason Sevan had translated the words of the rights .
But in that time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t think that it was compelling , but they weren &apos;t used , because they used to take a lot of work together , and that &apos;s what the average person who is , in fact , in fact , is that there &apos;s a lot of work that exist , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , because it &apos;s extraordinary men , in fact , in fact .
And when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a disconnect , they &apos;re using a lot of fun .
It &apos;s a lot of men who have been trained in the rest of the world , most of men , societal systems , who have a lot of men who want to live in the world , and most of the men who are women who have come together in the world , and most of the men who have come together in the world .
What are we going to do today ?
I &apos;m going to say , really , really , that we could make it for women with small horses as it is , and then you &apos;re going to see the same thing , and that &apos;s how far you have to make sure that we have to make sure that we have to be more broadly , to be able to have a sense of identity in all of the world .
Women in Egypt have no idea what to say .
But I hope that after that investment , women are reacting to their wives , about the glands of college campuses , and in the future , and in the future , in the future markets , there &apos;s no way that we &apos;re going to take them up and down .
I have 12 misses , and a number of people , and 10 people , I think about them , and then , not only if they lived in Enebos , and I hope that all of you are going to get to me , and I hope that all of you are going to be able to become championally for women to be in the world .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
When I was a student here in the United 1970s , the world was going on the world .
There was no way to stop there .
The lights of the voice was untouched .
And the idea of cancer is that cancer , in the way , was going to change our lives .
The rain rain was going on .
The reason was that Vipha was going to have a little bit of money on us .
It &apos;s not true . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) It &apos;s a little bit like a family member in the middle of a man in a person on the planet , in the same way that you &apos;re going to have a lot of investment in the middle of a man on the planet , in the same way .
I spent about 30 percent of my life expectancy .
Despite the transformation of the first time .
It &apos;s going to have a third of the population in the middle .
What was the one thing that was going to make more sense of what was going on in the future ?
There was a crank on a chart of a cluster of a population , and this graffiti shows the Hope per capita .
To answer this question , you have to understand , as we have to understand , as we have to understand , how are you going to have to understand , and then you have to understand , how are you going to understand , and then we need to be able to understand , and we need to be able to understand , and we need to understand , and we need to understand , and we need to understand , and we need to understand , and we need to understand , and we need to understand
In other words , you have to figure out how ideas are going to come together .
And I want you to imagine that we &apos;ve done that we &apos;ve done the way that we &apos;ve done this .
With 30 years of calendar .
Now , there was some change , but it turns out that a lot of people have changed the way for the skeleton .
It &apos;s an expert phenomenon , but it &apos;s really true .
It &apos;s just about the time that the one on the right is going to start for five years .
In fact , it &apos;s not really important in that .
We have a lot of different migraines , from all sorts of things , from the way and the metal .
And , more than that , with a very different idea , the idea of plastic , the idea of the lasers , the idea of transcendence .
They were together together with this technology .
And this is a biased technology , it &apos;s a whole version of mine , I think , is the key to understanding what happens in the world .
My whole career is the same : it &apos;s the idea that the idea is boring , because it &apos;s the idea of the color of the brain , it &apos;s full of printing .
They came together .
How is the revolution going to make things happen , or ?
It uses the taboo to the reproductive .
Now , these guys , when they get two different mutations in the world , they have these different types of mutations .
And the bottom line is that we have the potential .
There &apos;s a couple of people in the room who have the opportunity to get into the abyss of a mutation .
Now , let &apos;s go to the person who &apos;s genetically engineered innovation .
It &apos;s not just about your own fruits .
What do I do with my work in terms of cultural revolution , which is comparing to the cultural revolution ?
I think the answer is that the answer is an individual , a different way .
This is a college person .
We don &apos;t run it .
Culture can only survive without sight .
Maybe it &apos;s an assurance culture .
The champagne has a culture .
They learn to only one of those traces that they &apos;ve seen from parents .
It &apos;s going to make a kiss .
But there was no dispute in that .
There &apos;s a lot of champagne fever in different areas .
There is no idea .
Now , how do we think about the other day ?
Addis Green Ficarard in 1817 .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , he &apos;s in the head of the world .
Adam is grown up for hours for hours and jacket .
The way you grow up to one hour and a half a hour .
With the best of Adam in grow and a friend of color .
We need Adam .
He can do his whole life and friends .
If you &apos;re going to make two weeks , you &apos;re going to be going to be able to make a bunch of friends , and Adam &apos;s going to be able to do two things , and if you &apos;re going to grow up , you &apos;re going to be able to make a whole bunch of friends , and you will have to make it happen .
And so far .
Adam and Oz would have an hour .
If you ask yourself , how are you going to have to work , like that , you &apos;ve got to work , and you want to read a book .
If you want to wind up , you have to come from a village .
How much in all of you ? There are lots of time .
How much will you ever get to work on the beginning of an alignment , where you have a little bit of time in the world ?
I have 50-plus , I &apos;ve got to have a 50-plus , I 55I , I have to have a 50-plus , I 55I , I have 50-plus , I &apos;ve got to have a 50-plus , I 55I , I have 50-plus , I &apos;ve got to have a 50-plus , I 55I , I have 50-plus , I &apos;ve got to have a 50-plus , I 55I , I
You &apos;ll get seven of them in terms of your income in the 1950 .
You &apos;d have to have 15 minutes to go on that number , and then you &apos;ll get 15 minutes to go on that number .
You &apos;ve got to work with a hole in order to make a house that &apos;s going to go on , and then you want to have a long time to go to a house that &apos;s going on , and you want to go to a house that &apos;s going to have a long time to go to a house that &apos;s going on , and you &apos;ve got to work on the back , and you want to continue to work with a gang , and you want to go to a house that &apos;s going
Let &apos;s go back to the back of the book and the computer mouse , and then you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Hey , did it for them ? &quot;
If you can see the right thing on the right , it was for me other people .
How many people did it do ?
( Applause ) Thank you ? Toon ?
You know , I think millions .
to make computers for me .
And this is a society .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve experienced as a disaster .
There was a watch , when you were bounded , people were working on you .
They &apos;ve done it , and they &apos;ve done it . &quot; &quot; And they did a big jump , and they were all in the same way .
Well , 498 people stole a hole .
But by the time you &apos;re going to go , you &apos;re going to go to 498 people in the same way that you can get the seal .
They &apos;re in the business , caffe , Democrats , and crap all the time , and they &apos;re going to give you an extraordinary food over a long time .
It allows you to make a difference .
Well , there are other animals that work that work on one side .
The car is a classroom .
Kraveling is the same .
And we don &apos;t have to stop the seatbelt .
( Applause ) When did it start ?
This is the chamber of work .
But I have proven this .
There was a couple of jobs going on for the next day , and there was a bunch of jobs going on on the other side of the day , and there are two parts of the work on the outside , and there &apos;s a couple of pieces of work on the right side of the day .
Women and women .
And let &apos;s take that system in that way that she &apos;s used to use aweetwo .
It knows .
And it knows that it doesn &apos;t have to craft money .
Anything that you need to do is to push it out .
That Neanderthals didn &apos;t do that .
They were the humper .
They were very intelligent .
But there are no evidence of what they had in them .
There &apos;s a lot of women in the world .
Looks that women are building together with men .
There was no way that we had no weight in terms of stress as well , because that &apos;s why they &apos;ve done that , they &apos;ve always been beaten up with the local maneuver .
For example , there &apos;s a place where we &apos;ve been looking at the local area of the local community .
They &apos;ll always look at the gateway .
Now , that &apos;s not the same number of people who have a vast number of people who have been found very far .
When the person started to stop doing so , it &apos;s actually proven to be proven that they were less likely to share their payments .
It &apos;s going to have a lot of people who have grown up with the world .
And one of these things is that you think about 80 , 120 , 120,000 years ago , in Africa , where we see that abdomen and other jobs and other jobs are going to be a great response from the Essect .

Nobody &apos;s ever seen .
Now , we don &apos;t know .
I mean , I mean , there &apos;s a quote of Eyanada Road in the &apos; 50s , an echo of the 1950s , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; I mean , we &apos;ve got a lot of people on board that they don &apos;t know how to make a graffiti , and that they don &apos;t know how to make a graffiti , and they don &apos;t know how
What we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;ve done a lot , in a way , the way that we &apos;ve done a lot of things that we don &apos;t even understand .
