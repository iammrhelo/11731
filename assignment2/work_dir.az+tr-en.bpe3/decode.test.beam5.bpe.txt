Today , I &apos;m talking about invisible innovation .
I &apos;m now working on the solar technology .
And I &apos;ve got my little start to go into the stratosphere with the power of my memory .
So let &apos;s look at different kinds of things .
This is a little video about what we &apos;re doing .
...
You can get a little bit of money .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re just — I &apos;m just — I &apos;m going to take this part of the piece of video .
No . ( Laughter )
( Music )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The technology technology ...
Ah , did I have time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I &apos;d like to tell you what you &apos;re doing .
And after a few minutes , we &apos;ll go back to this . I hope that if you think about your body , if you think about it , it will change your life .
We think we &apos;re very interested in language , especially if we think about language .
The different stereotypes : ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I think we &apos;re trying to make sense of bias or a smile , and it &apos;s a simple thing that I &apos;m worried about .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , they get closer and closer to 10 different houses .
This is the lucky police of the U.S.
But when you push the fight — Youn@@ x . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to go back . We &apos;ll save ourselves .
Thank you .
We &apos;re trying to be invisible for the man in our garage .
As you can see , images and people do the same things .
And it turns out that there are no strength and strength .
We tend to do a lot of other people , and we tend to do the gestures of others .
Now , if someone who would tell us , if someone else has to come to us , we &apos;re trying to go out .
In contrast , we &apos;re going to get her strength .
Do you know what ?
And I saw that MBA students are able to make their nu@@ de gestures .
They &apos;re like leaders like leaders , when they &apos;re going to walk into the room , in the middle of the room , in the middle of the room , where they &apos;re not going to go back to class .
It weighs almost two grandmothers .
They get their hands on this .
They &apos;re invisible .
They &apos;re just like sitting in the middle and they &apos;re going to take their hand .
For me , I went back to a few things .
The first is that you will not .
It depends on it .
So women become more likely to get into this law .
They &apos;re more likely to feel more like men than men , and that &apos;s not the result .
And it &apos;s also true of lack of violence .
And this is very important for MBA students , because they &apos;re very interested in the outcome .
They &apos;re always pushing to the difference that we &apos;re always fighting .
The person who &apos;s been prepared for the same time , and the women , they get different grades at the end , and it looks like this .
And I began to think , well , I &apos;m going to think , well , that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to be in the middle of these networks .
If we want these videos , do you want them to show that they &apos;re going to be more active in the classroom ?
And if you could go very quickly , you wouldn &apos;t be able to get the rest .
So , if we make our brief hip loss , can we feel more powerful than the outcome ?
We know that our tradition and memes make sense of what someone else is about to think about and feel about ourselves .
But the question that makes us really curious about us is that these jury and memes don &apos;t affect ourselves .
But we also have to tell you that we &apos;re going to be proud of our teeth .
That &apos;s all two people .
It &apos;s also also true .
We tend to recognize that we tend to tend to be more powerful and more powerful than when we &apos;re feeling powerful , but we can feel strong .
It doesn &apos;t change our actions as we know how we think about our actions , but we don &apos;t change the way we think about things .
How do I think about the sense of power , thinking about power ?
And the idea and feeling of physics and feeling alien@@ ated by the feeling of physics , and you can see the hormones .
What is the difference that we think about ?
It &apos;s not necessarily clear that people are strong .
We like to tell them two truths to tell them .
And we need to make them play .
They chose to play a game with risk .
But it &apos;s about 60 percent . It &apos;s about 60 percent .
And this is what we &apos;re doing in the test .
It &apos;s about 20 percent increase in the age of the moment that I &apos;ve had , 20 percent increase in the early 20th test .
The two truths to make this change in two cases .
But there are these things that are happening in conflict .
And in the violent industry , the 25 percent increase in corruption , which is about 15 percent efficiency .
The two minutes that we have to do is take this ar@@ mon@@ al change , which is more ambitious and comfortable and comfortable and comfortable , and they don &apos;t feel .
This is what you &apos;re thinking about , yeah ?
We need to think about how we think about ourselves , how we think about ourselves and how we think about ourselves .
From that , we think about our thinking .
And the next question that we &apos;re interested in is that we have a very significant amount of truth that we don &apos;t have a few truths to do with our lives .
This is two truths that are held in heli@@ ces .
How do you do that ?
And that &apos;s what really matters to us .
And the idea that these bees can be used to be used in terms of economic education .
Are we chosen the outcome of the outcome ?
This is what &apos;s going on for innovation .
For some of you , they have meetings .
It &apos;s kind of an extension of it , or it &apos;s a business interview .
Now , we &apos;ve got the idea that many of you are interested in making people work , because they have experienced this experience .
So we did the tapir , and we made them a broad debate , and they said , &quot; &quot; What do we have to do when we deal with the interview ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Unfortunately , we did this idea .
That &apos;s what you do !
This is not with you .
Your self is three .
What do you do before you start ?
You &apos;re sitting there . You &apos;re looking at it .
You see , you &apos;re looking at your religion , you get your self-esteem . &quot; &quot; Actually , what you &apos;re supposed to do is , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do . You know , you &apos;re sitting in feet .
This was what we wanted to do .
After all , they went back to a very popular interview , and then they went back to a very popular interview with a very popular job .
He was able to take a video with five minutes .
They were taught that they could use an opportunity to take care of the most people to take care of them , to use them .
It &apos;s much better than five minutes to be able to be able to ask for a lack of damage .
Nobody likes it .
Mar@@ k La@@ de La@@ ce is saying , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t see the soci@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s increasing the amount of people in humans .
To see what they did , we had a conversation .
And then we &apos;ve shown that we &apos;ve got four of these images .
They didn &apos;t learn from our eyes .
They didn &apos;t know who they did . And when I looked at the video , and then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to take these things to work . &quot; &quot; And then they showed that they had high power .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to take those dishes .
And they &apos;re much more positives . &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s the impact on some other ?
That &apos;s not for them .
They &apos;re dependent on the edges of their food .
And we just went back to other parts of the environment , like , for example , how much the air is ?
Which is that ?
This is no difference .
This was not the most important impact .
People have just shown the truth .
So they did it .
They &apos;ve had no ideas , they show themselves .
This is the impact that happens .
And when I talk about people , we think about our thinking about how we think about ourselves , how we think about ourselves , how we think about it ?
Let me tell you how much the truth is .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t want to feel confident that I &apos;m going to make a reality .
I don &apos;t want to be alive .
I don &apos;t want to be a living room .
I &apos;m very good at telling you that these words are very good , and I want to tell you a little bit about a little story about the sense of meaning .
At the age of 19 , I had a lot of heavy energy .
Far from drinking furniture .
I had a few times everywhere .
I had to leave the brain in order to grow up the brain , and I had to leave the column , and I kept the news that my father would tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to go down two points . &quot; &quot; This was a very painful for me .
I was born , because I was known as a kid , and I was known as a young boy .
For me , I tried to go back to back .
They tell me , &quot; &quot; You will not end up .
There are things that you can do , but you don &apos;t have the column — they say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I started to challenge that , which is the essential feature that you had to have , which is the most important feature that you have to have , you know , that we don &apos;t know .
I felt totally visc@@ erally .
I was working , I was working , I worked on my own , and I would pay attention .
And I finished the column .
I &apos;ve had four years from my girlfriend , and I had to go back four years ago , and I was reminded me that I had to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t care about it . &quot; &quot; So , I was like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; So I came to go .
I was on the couch .
The first time that 20 to 20 percent of the 20 people are listening to the first time in the 20th century .
It was the first time .
I was so afraid of the morning , so I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , I &apos;m not going to tell you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , you will .
Oh , yeah , you &apos;ll go and say , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah , you &apos;ll go .
Even though it &apos;s at MoMA .
You &apos;ll make all the data you &apos;re going to do .
So , again , again , again , if you don &apos;t listen , and you &apos;re afraid , if you don &apos;t listen to the sky , then it &apos;s been said , &quot; It &apos;s been done .
I really did not really think . &quot; &quot; I did this .
It &apos;s about five years old , and it &apos;s a few years old , which is a few years ago , I &apos;m working on my own . I don &apos;t think about it . I don &apos;t think about it .
Finally , at the end of the first year , when I was at Harvard , he talked about a time when he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to get to join it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to go on .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is absolutely not my place , it &apos;s not my place . &quot;
This was my destination .
Because two things committed .
The first one was to deal with that sense .
But it felt , and that feeling felt like me .
And secondly , I had to understand that it was right .
So , it could be available .
And I said , &quot; &quot; No , you know .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you a little bit like this . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) You &apos;ll make it very strong , and you &apos;ll give you the best right , and you &apos;ll give you the best right now . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , a few months later , it landed . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) After a few months later , he came up to me , and he did not know how much she was , but a few months later ,
It changed .
And I would like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I would like to tell you ,
Help me more than ever before .
Tell yourself about how much you want .
You know , you know .
It can make huge changes .
Now , here &apos;s two minutes I said .
Two minutes , two minutes .
The next time you &apos;re going to measure the price of the year before the year , you &apos;ll try to figure out two truths , two truths to do .
You want to ask .
The best thing about your brain is to root up .
You increase your sanitation . You reduce your self-esteem .
I couldn &apos;t show them what I was saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t show them what I &apos;m going to tell you . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t give them a invention .
You see , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you who I am , and I &apos;ve been able to show you who I am . &quot;
And I want you to do it with you , and I want you to share it with other people , because that &apos;s very much .
This is not true . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) You know , it &apos;s not — that you learn from this learning , and people who are able to benefit from that learning , because people who are able to benefit from that information is people who don &apos;t even exist .
You share it with them , you can use it .
Because they don &apos;t pay attention to their bodies to be able to pay attention to their bodies .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have very much power in the world .
It &apos;s the best part between their strength and their strength .
It &apos;s a little bit of the labor that they &apos;re going to have to live in order to survive .
They &apos;ve made the majority of their conflicts in conflicts of conflicts of conflicts of conflict systems .
The larvae of all all sorts of people who benefit all of you all benefit from a severe , honest and useful business , but they don &apos;t leave them .
Here , in Italy , in the U.K. , the 90 percent of the product will be cut .
Most of the rocks are working .
Now , Kar@@ ro@@ plays a few balls in a few tiny balls , and they &apos;re prepared to be made from metal to the metal , and they remind you of the data and the name of the cube .
This became the reason I &apos;d never met with characters .
I &apos;m an artist , and I want to ask myself , &quot; &quot; What my work is , you know , I &apos;m not interested in politics , politics , politics and determination .
In 2009 , I converted my work on the outskirts of my job , and I converted my work on the outskirts of my job .
But I &apos;d like to join them on this time .
My work took more attention to my work , and I had more attention to my work , and it helped me go to focus on the point where they had to take care of them .
These days , they don &apos;t get the press and the soci@@ al meditation .
And so I &apos;ve always worked with this world that I &apos;ve always worked on .
In a lot of cities , I &apos;ve painted more than 200,000 square kilometers in the world , and I had a lot of commu@@ ters .
And I came back to the elephant , which is simply not the case that they don &apos;t appear .
And I came to them in the United States , in the suburbs , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , and in the United States , in the United States .
After that , I realized that more people have been more people , because it &apos;s great .
And then I created a movement underneath , I created a movement underneath , I created a movement underneath . ( Laughter )
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , it was a huge movement that was created by the purpose of the &quot; &quot; K@@ ro@@ le@@ vi@@ el , &quot; &quot; which was created by the purpose of a man and his career .
They had the <unk> dors , the stom@@ ers , the hair style , the hair therapists , the hair therapist , and those who were known to join me by professionals , and they had to join me .
In fact , when it was in@@ coherent by our fore@@ see@@ ming , the people who would say to them , they had to give them a chance to see the victims of the victims of the water .
They would take other options for lack of freedom : the publishers and the laugh .
And finally , it would be great , and they would have been part of this great journey , and they would be part of the journey .
It was &quot; &quot; K@@ rom@@ ul@@ o . &quot; &quot; Sa@@ jo Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro .
But in fact , in the middle of the Atlantic , we created a P@@ et@@ x , we created a call to create P@@ et@@ x , which we created , which we created , which we created , which was a result of the &quot; &quot; K@@ ro@@ x &apos;s eye . &quot; &quot; And we created a call from the bottom line .
So , he would be able to join everyone .
Two years old , 1,@@ 70 or 200 square years old , 200 or 200 or 200 or 200 or 200 or 200 or 200 , and they had to be able to have a movement with the rest of the world .
They would have to go back to the promise that they &apos;re going to be able to put in their respect to their respect , and they would have people who would disagree .
They could be able to go through the eye of your eye , and they could grow up with their ideas and communities .
Now , now , I &apos;m going to tell you to find out if you &apos;re in the city in your city , and I &apos;d like to tell you to know about them .
Try to see the boundaries without borders and resources .
No doubt , no matter in the world , there are over 20 million .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we don &apos;t know somebody else .
Moses , thank you .
( Applause )
5 : In the middle of the 1990s , in the middle of the 1990s , in the middle of the United States , at the University of Sri Lanka , in the middle of the United States , the United States , the name of the United States Company .
He was known to be known to be made by a man@@ gled ceremony , but it &apos;s been known for the other few months , and they were prepared for the other few months , and they were ready for a full eclip@@ se , and they were ready for the head of the ark .
There were plans from X@@ F@@ B to plans .
But sadly , in 1990 , the World Trade Society couldn &apos;t take the United States .
Finally , in the middle of his chest , he was known .
My father was my father .
In 1987 , Pennsylvania , in Pennsylvania , I opened up the world as an icon , and I opened up the world as an iconic African community , and they didn &apos;t tell me how to live my happy childhood .
After the food , after my family , my family started to change .
I didn &apos;t tell you that I had a lot of people to see a lot of people who were very little people .
But I &apos;ve learned about these things that I &apos;ve learned from experience , and when people know one of them , we don &apos;t even understand that each of each of us is the same for their own lives .
Every time you want to be able to make sure that the people who are fighting every nation , every nation who has to take care of their own lives , and their own lives would lead to people in their lives .
About a couple of months ago , it was a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , the police said to the police .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to go to your religion .
We went to the Minister of Finance , we didn &apos;t even know that we were going to have a secret observation .
He helped me with my husband , and she helped me with my husband , and he &apos;d really appreciate how to deal with 30 square kilometers .
The last laugh that I jumped on the day that I jumped on the stage , the little bit of nu@@ om@@ om@@ er , the result of the results , and the result was the result .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; Whoa . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little . &quot;
This would all laugh , but after a few years , I actually understood what they laughed .
They thought that my father had seen what they saw .
And finally , when these people were living in the hillside of the World Trade Organization full of sexual matter , the equivalent of the World Trade Organization , which was the equivalent of 50 pounds of people , and over 1,000 people were injured , and more than 1,600 people .
These people take my mind to my self .
&quot; &quot; uncle , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; ...
By 19 years old , we &apos;ve changed 20 times , and my kids had less than my parents , and my friends had less .
And some of them would be a new city , and some of them would be a new city .
And as a new person , I had always turned out to be a new person .
In order to not be in the middle of the speaker , I would keep the secret of my identity to not be in the middle of the city , but it was obvious that you had a new masterpiece , and it would have to do that .
So I spent a lot of time reading a lot of my time to read a book , and I had a game of games .
Now , I &apos;ve had conflicts of conflicts of conflicts that I shared with a soci@@ ologist , who grew up in a family , like someone who grew up in a family .
I grew up in a country where people like people and religion are being served as religion .
What did it take ?
One of my first experiments was the time that I had ever chosen this kind of thinking about this kind of thinking about this kind of thinking .
I had to take the program in the University of National Park , in the University of National Geographic , in the University of National Park .
I didn &apos;t know whether I was in a mess between young people and young people , and I didn &apos;t know how much of my life would be , as one of the kids , I didn &apos;t know .
Our women had different lifestyle different lifestyle .
I learned that one of the kids I &apos;ve been friends in the last days of Congress was that one of the kids I got friends were .
This was just a few days a year , but I came to realize that we don &apos;t want to understand the fact that we don &apos;t want to understand the moment .
And before I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never been a friend , and my way to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a sense of the fact that I could believe it was impossible for my life . &quot;
But I had a better part of the time that I &apos;d find a little bit of time in the corner of the day , the job that I find for the next year .
And I was in the middle of people who were different , and that experience , and this experience of mine played the perfect role in the future .
I was taught that a major part of my life was a day that I had to teach a tremendous part of what I was thinking about .
It makes it work , and I &apos;ve been able to work with gay artists in one way , which I &apos;ve seen as many of them , and the most likely people I &apos;ve ever seen as if you &apos;re going to go to the top of them .
I took love . I &apos;m very lucky to make a sense when I &apos;m very lucky , and I don &apos;t want to make a sense of what I want to do with my self , and I don &apos;t want to tell myself that I don &apos;t want to do anything .
I used to be able to take care of my mental illness as a child who was teaching me about my childhood life .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , but because of all of the reasons why don &apos;t you get there , you know what &apos;s going on .
And then it became &quot; &quot; The D@@ RT Show . &quot; &quot; And I had to be honest with myself to be honest with my righte@@ ity , and I had helped me to be honest with myself , and the fact that he helped me talk about the fact that he was not associated with the quality of his life .
In the moment , there was something that I had had to do in the moment when I was in the moment when I had a horse .
The inspiration came out of a very long time , and it turned out to be more positive than my father had been able to show the world in my view of the world that I had to tell the world about the world .
One day , my mother was talking about my mother , my mother , my mother , and my mother said to me , I &apos;m not going to make my own life .
So my mom said to me , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve been looking at my eyes with a lot of do@@ xes . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
I understood how much less it would be , how much less it is , how much less it is .
The Z@@ ach E@@ Uncle Ibrahim is not the rest .
I &apos;ve always changed my father &apos;s relationship with my father , my father , my father .
Why did I make it clear ?
It &apos;s very clear .
I hope that , maybe , when I think about it , maybe someone who is more likely to take a story about my story , is that I didn &apos;t have a tendency to go back to extraordinary stability .
I chose to use my lifestyle as I had to use my lifelong experience as I had my lifelong experience .
Thank you , and I use them to make sure that <unk> geons are living in the same way that the thermostat is living .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about the activity of these kinds of rules that I &apos;ve been able to communicate with , hopefully , in order to communicate .
As simple as my simple example , I &apos;m living in the middle of the day , and I &apos;m living in a living room that &apos;s not going to go through the way that the rest of the day .
I &apos;m not like .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
Good morning .
Wouldn &apos;t it rain ?
They took a little bit on the floor , and I wanted you to ask , &quot; &quot; I want you to ask you . &quot; &quot; Who here &apos;s a word in Arabic ?
Who &apos;s writing ? Who ? No , no problem .
A few months ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , and I made sure .
I looked at office , and I said , &quot; You know ?
He thought , &quot; &quot; He looked at me by thinking about the wrong thing .
He said , &quot; &quot; Do you pray ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know the Mal@@ i .
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( British English ) ( Applause ) In fact , in French magazine ?
He said , &quot; &quot; This is what you &apos;re doing ! Have you done it ! &quot;
He would call from me to talk to me . He would say , &quot; &quot; If that &apos;s the best girl in this world , I wouldn &apos;t look at it . &quot;
What do you call &quot; &quot; Men@@ u &quot; &quot; word ?
In the middle of two words , L@@ ob@@ ana young boys , who were singing and singing .
How do you talk about it ?
Now , I started thinking .
This was me .
This is a man , a man .
In my country , they don &apos;t think about it in your country .
Is it going to lead to other ?
How do we go here ?
But it turns out that there are many people here , like me , there &apos;s a lot of people in their lives to tell you that they &apos;re not just about the modern , but they don &apos;t really think about the modern and reality .
Have I forgotten my whole civilization , my ideas , my ideas , and I don &apos;t forget ?
What we did was we have the best opportunity to ask about success .
I &apos;m not talking about what I learn in Arabic .
Have I forgotten to be one of them ?
What was it ?
And yet , I tried to deal with it .
I didn &apos;t want him to tell me that I didn &apos;t ask me to do justice .
Their language doesn &apos;t respond to the dragonflies .
It &apos;s not the study of my hand , it &apos;s not the study of the study that we &apos;re used to devise in the workplace where we &apos;re used to develop a platform where we &apos;re used to develop a platform where we &apos;re used to develop a platform where we are used to work .
If we did this , they stopped our palms .
What do I have to use ? We have to make our rights .
You don &apos;t want it , we can &apos;t use it .
This is a reality .
But there is another reality that we have to think about .
It &apos;s a language language .
In the car , you &apos;re saying to be perfect in other languages .
In the Arabic language , the ideas in other languages are able to express .
What ?
He took the first time to start writing the first time in which he wrote the device .
His whole ideas would have been in the middle of all ideas , and the way that she was in the middle of the door , the young boy who was a special day in the village .
So , in that English , he had enough excuses .
In fact , when you read in English , you feel like that when you read in English , you feel like that .
You can imagine , you can imagine , in English , in English , that is the boy .
This is a myth that no one has to do .
Secondly , if you want to kill a nation , if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill the nation .
This is a reality that societies have evolved .
The Germans , the Germans , they — these nations — these are the differences .
And so , they don &apos;t make their own language protection .
They &apos;re doing this .
And so they use their language to use their language to develop language .
More than them ?
All right , we &apos;re saying that we &apos;re not going to grow up in the world , we don &apos;t have yet to come up with us , and we would want to stay with the world .
It &apos;s a time when countries like us , but they &apos;ve been working for development , and in fact , the countries like Mongolia , like Mongolia , and so on and so forth , they were able to put them in their languages , and they did not keep it .
They kept language .
Because if you could take that out of the species , and if you could get a choice from another place in the bottle , it doesn &apos;t matter if you don &apos;t .
You didn &apos;t believe it would be a native product .
They &apos;re kind of made up like before , as we are in the days when we &apos;re too busy .
So they have to preserve their own language and demand their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; A@@ z@@ a , the wetlands , the wetlands , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Ad@@ oration , &quot; &quot; is to tell you what ?
Have butter , right ?
Who , of course , and why .
Language is not just the same as the words of our mouth .
The language of our lives with a specific point in our lives , and our unique aspects of our own life .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Amira , &quot; &quot; as we say , if you say , &quot; &quot; A@@ z@@ a@@ z@@ ness , &quot; &quot; the special image of all of you think that each of you may have special thinking about life .
Language is not one , two or three or three or not .
That &apos;s how we think about how we think about how we &apos;re seeing each other , how we &apos;re seeing our lives , how we &apos;re seeing each other .
What &apos;s the builder ?
You can tell you , what do you say ?
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; A@@ z@@ a , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; A@@ z@@ and@@ ness , &quot; &quot; and if you or you or your son , &quot; &quot; A@@ w , you know ?
What do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , I &apos;ll go back and talk to empty space .
That &apos;s what it means to suggest that these things are specific to us .
I have a friend who &apos;s married to me who married me .
I asked one day , how do you go ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Every thing is , I &apos;m fine . But I &apos;ve been trying to make a whole day , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been trying to get a whole day to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve been trying to make it a whole day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We said , &quot; &quot; The car is a man . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
He said , &quot; &quot; No , how much hell can you feel ? &quot;
Do you want suicide ?
It &apos;s the press ? &#91; In English ? &quot;
And we started thinking about it , because we don &apos;t need to deal with the women , to tell you that we don &apos;t need to deal with that .
And my friends said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m listening to my self and my father , &quot; &quot; and I tried to make my sense for him , which I had always tried to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ve experienced when I &apos;m listening to it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got my hands on this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem , because I had to go back to my hands , and
Let me say that .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We are able to put it in the subject of citizenship , and we &apos;ve started to go back to the campaign to preserve the Arabic .
And so many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you bother ?
This is the title of the headache , and it says , &quot; &quot; No problem .
This was the fact that I told you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to remind you of this , I &apos;m talking to you , I &apos;m talking to you . You give me the answer . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose that way , because we didn &apos;t really deal .
And if someone would talk to me , I &apos;m not talking to you .
We say , ( Applause ) We say , ( Applause ) We want to change our own reality and our dreams , our dreams and our dreams .
We &apos;re going to be the same as a deer , and we &apos;re also thinking about it .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take you off , but you give me the answer .
Very simple , at the same time , creative .
And then we started into another campaign to another campaign in the bag .
You don &apos;t see this example , you don &apos;t see it in the middle of the letter , and the yellow , and the yellow is a result of the &quot; &quot; kill &quot; &quot; software .
Why ? Once , kill .
We need to kill our names .
If we had to kill our language , we had to find identity .
We &apos;ve got to find our gift .
We had to go back to the beginning .
This is a serious issue than we &apos;re thinking about .
And then we set up the images and the images of girls and girls and girls .
&quot; &quot; Close &quot; &quot; girls and boys and boys .
Thank you .
And who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ icha , you &apos;ve created English . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Ah , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m not in denial . &quot; &quot; But give me a better promise to tell me that the reality is better .
I &apos;m going to go back to saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go online . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , I &apos;m going to show you the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t hurt ! We need to have an affair .
But what we have to believe is that if we think about it , we have to believe that if it &apos;s the question of what &apos;s going on , we need to give people thinking about what &apos;s going on , and what we need to do is think about what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s ide@@ alized .
If we don &apos;t know , if we don &apos;t know it can fly , and so we can be creative .
All you have is a creative project .
It &apos;s a way of the essence of your main language .
Let &apos;s start this moment .
Let &apos;s write novel films and video .
We can rebuild the novel us .
This means that we can go back to the United States .
It &apos;s not flat . &quot; &quot; Not flat . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not flat .
But we have to believe that there &apos;s no way , and we have to believe that it &apos;s a bit like a part of the road .
What do you do today ?
Who is it ? Who cares ?
And if I have time that I spend time on my time , I would like to spend a lot of time in English , English .
But don &apos;t you write in Arabic in Arabic that &apos;s in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is the promise ! It &apos;s not language .
You go through the two-dimensional world .
It &apos;s not easy to go back from a place like this .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , we have many other things that we can do .
So we &apos;ve got to make sure that this day we &apos;ve got to make our each other .
So we &apos;re here to focus on the attention of this language that protects language .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you .
The first time it knows that the first time it comes to the language of language .
My daughter was born in the east , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; This is the end of the morning , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; Oh , thank you . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot;
( Applause ) Now , we &apos;ve been able to learn about this destiny . ( Applause )
Now , a few years ago , you can see the American fleet of the U.S.
I learned a couple of things when I was doing this 30 days .
More than the months after the months later , the months later .
For a month , I took a picture every day .
I had 30 days of exams .
I learned that I had learned about it .
And by the way , it doesn &apos;t happen to make a decision that it needs to do .
But you &apos;ll end the crowd .
It &apos;s very good .
I don &apos;t have to tell him to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the computer . &quot;
No , if I ask you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a printer . &quot;
I learned that I had learned that they were small , and I could make sure that they had to take care of them .
Actually , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
The first day I started in college and optim@@ ally full of hope .
I read a school , my tears were high school , and I got my eyes full of life , and I began to live in my lifetime .
This was a very compelling image of a very high , high-@@ energy , and a very compelling image .
If Dav@@ x@@ il@@ n , I was feeling very sad , very sad , and I &apos;m afraid of all of the people who feel comfortable in the future , and I &apos;m afraid of the space .
But I learned that I could hide these fears .
It was so compelling that it was so compelling that even though I knew that I was too sorry , I didn &apos;t even think about it .
So , as I started , as I did earlier , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a good voice in my water , my wife , &quot; &quot; when I left the room , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , he left the hotel .
No matter , no matter who I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Hmm , no matter what I &apos;m saying .
And in Sardin@@ ia , the readers put the books on the batteries .
&quot; &quot; Oh , he opens the door . &quot; &quot; — I heard .
This was a kind of beginning . It was coming .
And then , first of all , let me talk about the third person in the third person .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a success .
And then , after a while , it would sound like a companion and a half a time , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve never imagined that when you &apos;re too busy , it &apos;s going to make sense . &quot; &quot; And I decided to give you an idea that I don &apos;t expect .
For example , when I got older , my people would come back to the people that I &apos;m worried about and my real life .
I had never worried about it , but what I felt was that I felt that I was working on my own , no matter what I had to do .
I told my stories about what I was hearing about , and that was the opposite .
And it turns out that the emergence of communication , which is the fact that ordinary people don &apos;t hear the sounds , and my truth was serious .
There was a little bit of fear when it was funny , and it turned out , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve had a great deal . I &apos;ve made a second biggest mistake .
I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to have a chance of living .
And I &apos;ve seen a mess line that I &apos;ve had , and I &apos;ve seen a lot of faith in my own self , and as I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And as I said , what I &apos;m going to do is go back and forth .
I had this epiphany , and I started talking to him about my father , and I started talking to him about justice .
And he &apos;s at that moment .
I &apos;ve managed to run on a psychologist , and he looked at all of the sudden everything I said , and everything that I said later , everything that I said , then I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know what I said .
For example , I used to work with my students , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to go to a talk . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to go .
I have to read news news stories about six years . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said .
And then , after that , it started to go back to the state .
I was in the middle of my father , and when he did it , he put in schizophrenia in schizophrenia , and then the top one is a sense of hope , a sense of lack of hope , a sense of damage .
It &apos;s not the way that you &apos;re going to be my lifelong life , but because I believe it was my country , it was afraid , and my crew began to feel like that .
This is a kind of thing for me to call this cry against my mouth , one of the results of the results , and the results began to sound like that .
I was back to my inner city , and I had no idea of hope , but I &apos;ve also got back to my inner world .
For example , if I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to change my life , and that &apos;s a strange , kind of strange , bizarre type of consciousness .
Many of them found that , in fact , we &apos;ve got three ways of catching up with my head , and then they had dramatic interest , and in particular , they had dramatic findings , for example : &quot; You see ?
Do you see the stadium in the water ?
And in the audience , the teacher would say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m sorry , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve done .
After all , it was a transition time , and it was in@@ coherent , in@@ conceivable and in@@ coherent , and I didn &apos;t think that if I had my strength , I didn &apos;t think about whether I had to make peace .
Two years later it started .
So , I had no interest in all of the girls : crazy noises , which are strange , very bizarre .
It became a bowl for intolerance , and for the physical and sex@@ ism , it became an instrument for people , and my cousin said to me : that schizophrenia takes more than schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to make it more comfortable than schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; And when I was a line , I wanted to be able to get my head out of them .
Now , I &apos;ve been thinking about the past , and in fact , when you &apos;re looking at the horizon , I think one of the differences will die , and I think it &apos;s a difference .
It &apos;s a way to go to the audience , and it &apos;s been sent out to be able to get rid of that line , and then finally , I &apos;d be able to go back to one person where I had to go back .
I had lost a lot of people on my pay@@ roll , and they &apos;re not going to be the ones that have helped me , but it was very weak and left to me .
I &apos;ve had another voice , and my way that my partners became equal , and in my environments , my mother who believes in the spirit of life , who believes in the spirit , and how much I needed to wait for it , and how much I needed to wait for it to be — &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t hurt .
And I believe that Elec@@ fully , the definition of that .
Sometimes it rains , and if it rains , it &apos;s an absolute bow . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , I don &apos;t want to thank all of these people who are willing to go back .
But they were in the United States , and they became the spirit of the spirit of my spirits .
I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you that I had to tell you something that I &apos;m going to tell you about , and at the top , I &apos;ve always got to understand something that I &apos;m going to tell you about when I &apos;m concerned that I &apos;ve heard about my childhood , and I don &apos;t have my voice anymore , but I don &apos;t have my voice , but I didn &apos;t have my voice .
And of course , early days , I had to believe it was hard to believe , and it was hard to believe that I didn &apos;t tell him whether I was talking about the truth of truth .
For example , I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve been able to take my house in my home , and I learned that I don &apos;t even know how to deal with myself , but I &apos;ve learned to talk about fear and education .
I believed in them .
I can &apos;t even tell you that I &apos;ve ever been sitting in front of my parents &apos; gates to protect them in the door of my parents &apos; gates .
So I had a lot of people in the house because I had a problem that was a problem in the house , in the middle of the hotel , in the middle of the hotel , and a bad thing .
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to be .
Have you ever seen plastic ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m like .
And then I was able to convince myself that the most important thing that I had to do is I was able to make the more important that I was able to make : I was thank you for giving them a sense of how much more I would feel , because when I think about it , you know , you know what I &apos;m going to tell you about , because when I think about it , I &apos;ve convinced them , and I &apos;ve convinced them that I have to convince them that I &apos;m not
Now , let &apos;s make it better , but I started to respond to the possibility of giving them the possibility of how to deal with the opportunity to learn .
I learned that all of these things that I haven &apos;t solved , and I &apos;ve never solved it all the time that I could solve , the magic , the shame , the shame that I had not solved .
I &apos;ve explored these wounds , and I discovered that these things have been translated into words , and I &apos;ve discovered that the sounds of the most amazing things that I &apos;ve ever discovered is that these sounds really sound like the most important thing .
After all , after all the time , I had to go back to the parts of the closet , and put it back from the components from the top , and then I went back to the same thing , OK .
And after the first time I heard the sound of the first time , the first time I heard the height of the University of college , I graduated from the University of college , and then I had the highest degree of mag@@ psychology .
One of the icons was my grandfather time .
I &apos;m very sorry , I &apos;m very proud of it .
And as the Oscar said .
And in the same time , we don &apos;t see two interviews next to anyone else .
And I &apos;ve been working on the health of the book , and I &apos;m going to go back and forth , and I &apos;m going to go back and forth , and I &apos;m going to continue to go back and forth , not the question of question .
All this time I &apos;m listening to them , I &apos;ve learned to live with them , and the sense of compassion that I &apos;ve experienced is increase the sense of respect and respect .
I could help to tell you that the most powerful thing that I &apos;m going to have to think about is that I could help other people who have the most effective .
It &apos;s a sense that we &apos;ve known all the way across the United States , in the middle of the United States , of the United States , of the United States of America , and Dr. Sandy , and Dr. Sandy &apos;s working on the work of the work that we &apos;re going to have to learn from the work of the way that we &apos;re going to have to learn from the work that we have to learn from the work that we have to learn from the work that we have learned from the work
They need to join them with respect and understanding the needs of people to be able to deal with respect and understanding them .
This kind of community is possible ; it &apos;s possible .
There &apos;s a pattern that says , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have the same as the social change .
It &apos;s not going to take the ball .
It &apos;s not afraid to make people feel afraid .
For me , the truth is that you don &apos;t know that the truth is that you don &apos;t know the truth and respect that the truth is not just what we &apos;re saying , but the truth is that we don &apos;t know .
In the last 20 years , you &apos;re not going to spread the United States , and in the past 20 countries and 26 countries , we &apos;re going to expand the possibilities of people who are suffering and coercion , and we &apos;re going to spread out of people who have hope that we &apos;re not going to go into the human potential .
It &apos;s a living entity that &apos;s a virgin , as the Pi@@ le said , is a virgin , which is a person who has a body to take care of people .
In this view , for our community , for our society , for our society , to take advantage of it , to take advantage of it , to make it affordable , to create a good one , and for the health .
We have to learn from violence , and we have to remember it .
We &apos;re unique . We &apos;re fine .
It &apos;s not going to take us from the past , and it &apos;s not going to go from us .
All right .
He said , &quot; &quot; I want to talk to you about what &apos;s going on . &quot;
Tell me about it . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
This is what I &apos;m going to tell you about my vagina .
But is this picture ?
Because , of course , your camera is not a picture .
And I &apos;m the marathon , my marathon , when I was 15 years old .
I put it in my career with my marathon , but in a little different way , because of the camera , I would have been planning before I was using it .
And when you take a picture , you can take a picture of your mask , and you &apos;re ready .
Now , the picture was not the right place in the right time .
I thought , everyone can do that .
So I wanted to do a different thing , which is a different thing that I &apos;d like to do a different thing .
So images like this : this is what we &apos;re working on .
But it turned out to be an invisible game .
And yet , it looks very close to reality .
Or images like this — you can also see images like that dark , but it turns out that all of you have to preserve it .
Now , when I think about strate@@ x@@ ism , I &apos;m going to act in theory .
Because of course , what we &apos;re really going to do is not just images that we &apos;re going to do , but I &apos;ve never wanted to be able to make it possible .
To deal with a little bit of ideas to deal with a little bit of ideas .
So this is a really good idea that we &apos;re really holding right now .
So what makes it clear that he &apos;s going to be able to make it visible ?
Do you don &apos;t go with those holes if you don &apos;t ?
Does it matter ?
What &apos;s the success of the first time ?
Sometimes it &apos;s a culture that &apos;s been involved .
But the lander is , how to deal with the Earth , in 2D .
It &apos;s not really what this reality is , but it &apos;s really what seems to us .
So the main idea is very straightforward .
I &apos;m going to find it in a place where I &apos;m going to make it work and create an alternative reality that I created an alternative reality .
I show you a simple example .
Here &apos;s the physical thing that we have ever imagined in three numbers of literature , which are the physical thing that we have in 3D .
But in a certain way , it looks like a three-dimensional object that exists in the United States again .
And we know that , we know .
So we can play games with our brain , because our brains don &apos;t have the sense of reality .
And I see the same process as the same process .
This is actually associated with one of the real truths of reality .
So what we don &apos;t think about is a picture that I think we don &apos;t think about , things that we don &apos;t think about , our daily lives .
It &apos;s really important to do that , because it &apos;s really important to do that , because normally , it seems to be wrong .
And what I want to tell you is that there are three simple things that we need to make a real deal .
As you see , these images don &apos;t have a special place .
But in the process , something that happens .
So , in the first time , you have to have the exact same image of the first image .
Secondly , images have to be the same .
And these are two of the same shapes — the same as the same source , and the same light .
And third , the image of the image of one , which is created in the middle of one of the years , is that one of the things that we &apos;re going to take away from the movement of the other .
It &apos;s not to be able to put it in the way that they &apos;re created .
In the border between images , the color of the color between the images and the color of the color , we make the boundaries between the different images , the color of the land , the color , the color of the color , the color of the color , and yet , in a way , there are hundreds of holes in a way that are different .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) But people can think that this is an image of a situation where it &apos;s an artist , and that &apos;s the bottom line .
But in fact , it turns out that a whole bunch of different places , which are different from these different places .
I think it &apos;s much easier for a place , which is far more elevator than you can imagine .
But it takes a lot of plans .
And I could be able to find a few months to find out how to find different places , to try and find out different places .
For example , when it &apos;s an image of the fish , it &apos;s the picture .
The edges are different .
The six of the water is in a trance .
And I could paint the house in order to make the home of Sweden even more than a home .
So I think it &apos;s possible that I think it &apos;s possible to make sense of reality .
Every time , it starts with ideas .
Then they put different pictures together .
This is the kind of thing that we &apos;re thinking about .
And if you do good pictures , it turns out it &apos;s pretty good , and it can also be pretty cooperative .
So we have all the assets that we need , and the only thing that we need is our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Julian is Julius .
This is a data that &apos;s been made in the last few years , and it published more information from the data in the last few years .
Is that possible ?
Julian As@@ san@@ ge : Yes , that &apos;s possible ?
The rest of the world is to push the world up to the rest of the world , and a small activist with a small activist , a small activist from all the world press press .
CA : How do you do that ?
How about people ?
How do you keep talking about legislation ?
JA : So what we know is that we &apos;re not going to be able to do the information . These are different ways to get to us .
You can take information to the Internet , to allow information to communicate to the Internet , to allow information to be able to deliver the law , to make it safe to make it safe .
And it turns out that it &apos;s a little bit of information about information , and it turns out that if it comes to other people , it &apos;s kind of a little bit — that it can be a little bit difficult — and it can be a little bit harder — and it &apos;s a little bit harder — and we &apos;re going to be able to preserve the public and our political beliefs .
CA : So you can &apos;t see the subject of the subject . &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t know who the data is .
JA : It &apos;s true . We don &apos;t know them rare . If you don &apos;t know the data from the side of the data , we don &apos;t get the data from the information .
( Phone : No . )
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the S@@ A-@@ man who &apos;s been asked for a TED Talk . ( Laughter )
I think we &apos;re going to take a look .
This is a few years ago .
Let &apos;s look at this .
It was a story from Keny@@ ans .
How do you talk about this story about how you &apos;re going ?
JA : This is a documentary .
And after the year , the year after the year , he had a study taken by Kenya .
In Kenya , in Kenya , in Kenya , it was powered by Daniel Bar@@ i .
He was the ones I interviewed .
With the power of Co@@ itarian power , the power of the power of Co@@ ali@@ tion , the power of a half million pounds , published two million pounds .
The government had been used in this assessment of the state , in the United States , and now they used to use the political motive .
This is a book of Kenya in Kenya .
In 2009 , 28 grandmothers , I could go and get a few months ago , I could get some of the documents .
And we published this from the fact that we were going to go back to a new man , a new redesign of Ki@@ k@@ ley , who was going to go back to the car , and then we published this phenomenon after that event .
CA : It &apos;s not a long word . It &apos;s not about a lot — it &apos;s not to deal with the status of the traditional Kenya press , and you &apos;re thinking about it .
JA : Yeah . But in fact , in the head of Guardian , and then in the middle of the Guardian , Tanzania and Can@@ u@@ bi were the class in Africa .
It came from outside of Africa .
In a few days in a few days , Kenya has begun to write a comfortable writing .
In fact , 20 percent would have been published in the Kenya press , and it changed 10 percent of Kenya , because it would change the way that the consequences of Kenya would change 10 percent .
CA : So , how do you leak the information that you suck up ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : This time , this time , there &apos;s video about the air .
The video is a little bit long . It &apos;s a short clip .
I &apos;ve got a little bit of hands on this video .
Ra@@ di@@ o : ... above all , above all sides .
Now , the visibility looked like this .
It &apos;s the Enlightenment .
When you see the Hazar@@ a , the news is .
His name is the winner .
Go , horse !
( Beatboxing ) ( Applause ) Stand out of guns .
The hotel is Buckminster Fuller , Pi@@ sh@@ g Tw@@ x , Pi@@ sh@@ g .
He needed to go back .
We killed that eight grandmothers .
There are two examples , we &apos;re going to go ahead .
Ol@@ u died . He died .
She@@ o-@@ C@@ x , the Twi@@ -@@ C@@ x , a Twi@@ -@@ Actor .
O@@ op@@ oms . What did he do ?
Z@@ i@@ ka , K@@ ig@@ ali .
CA : So how did this video ?
JA : This was heavy for people who had worked .
This video was sent two grandmothers in Baghdad .
This is actually one of the three sources of video .
CA : If you weren &apos;t in the sky , 11 grandmothers have been killed by the age of 11 years ?
JA : Yeah . Two degrees Fahrenheit died , two children died .
And in fact , 18@@ -@@ 26 grandmothers died .
CA : That &apos;s what they did to publish .
What would you like to tell you about , and the main reason of anxiety ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people have an opportunity for power .
They don &apos;t even have to go back to the corner of the people who have flown out of the corner of all of people , and they don &apos;t even have a reason — and even without any reason — and even if they don &apos;t do it , they kill them .
There were two scenarios that have seen what &apos;s going on , and there &apos;s a couple of years ago .
CA : In the United States of the United States , the total increase in the United States , Brad@@ ley Man@@ n@@ oping , who was asked to tell you that if you were asked by the video that you &apos;ve been asked , you could tell you that the 2@@ 8@@ 00-@@ U.S. U.S.
Is that true ?
JA : We did not take that article .
And after about five days , they had to be arrested after 150 times when he died , and after that .
We &apos;ve been published this year by the year President of the United States , and we &apos;ve published the pictures of that year .
I &apos;ve had the answer to that list .
CA : If the United States would end up with diplomatic documents ?
JA : We &apos;ll publish them publish . ( CA : Okay . ) JA : Yeah .
They have this kind of material that &apos;s kind of material .
CA : We &apos;re going around a little bit about this .
So , if you don &apos;t , if you &apos;re based on the ideas ?
How do you think about the secret of secret design ?
JA : So there &apos;s a question that is important for the world , which is important for the world .
There &apos;s a lot of information .
It turns out that these news leaders are going to be a new and good thing to hide , which is the news that we &apos;re doing in terms of new and good things .
There &apos;s always always this thing that &apos;s always happening .
CA : But there are no less people who are disabled , no time , people who don &apos;t belong to you .
JA : It doesn &apos;t matter whether the data we &apos;re broadcast .
So , we have politics .
There are some people who have been able to communicate and publish together and publish together .
There is a laws — a matter of fact that the health of the disease , who doesn &apos;t belong to the heart of the disease , but we &apos;re working with journalists .
CA : De@@ fin@@ itely good .
If the son of his son came to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , the son of the United States , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , if you don &apos;t know who or the purpose of someone else ? &quot;
The people would die when the United States was dying .
This shows that the people in the world don &apos;t feel human being a human being , not necessarily .
That &apos;s not my son . What do you call this ? &quot; &quot; What would you answer ?
JA : They &apos;re very good .
But I don &apos;t even know what this video is going on , we don &apos;t need to see people in front of this video , they don &apos;t need to see them .
They don &apos;t change their minds . They don &apos;t change their beliefs .
Every single day , they get their lives .
This is how many people pay for success , but that &apos;s what we don &apos;t know .
CA : So you don &apos;t find a way to find a way that you &apos;re going to find a way that you can see the secret sauce .
It &apos;s very good to launch .
But this is the funny thing that happens to light up to light , to light up your self-esteem .
JA : It &apos;s not exactly what it . It &apos;s not really .
Or we don &apos;t have the data on the other side .
If it &apos;s a lot of people , and it &apos;s hard for us to do . We &apos;re working with ours , trying to make sure that the men who do work with us will continue to help us .
CA : So what do you think I &apos;ve been hearing about is important — how do you think about this about this ?
There are two kinds of ideas about Wiki@@ Lesterland and Julius .
One — that &apos;s what I needed to do .
The next one is different .
Who is thinking , what is it ?
What do we do ?
JA : Well , no matter , no matter .
CA : This interview people , Julius .
We &apos;re going to be a little bit more . &quot; &quot; So let me show you .
This is a challenge that I &apos;m not even published yet , but it &apos;ll be broadcast to TED .
This is an interesting thing to deal with recently ?
What is it about ?
JA : This is an example of what we see every day .
And the last year — in March the last year , in the middle of the Pacific , in the middle of the Gulf , in the Gulf of Mexico , when it was strong .
So we were able to account for one of these engineers , which is actually a way to go on the road , where companies are actually leading to a place .
And there was a great deal of the press and others .
But there was no relationship with them , and there was no relationship with them .
We didn &apos;t know who was writing and what was about .
We would be less likely to be able to make the play of the power of the company .
So , in fact , let &apos;s look at the data , and we said , &quot; &quot; We are a little bit nervous .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do .
Okay . So it seems like we don &apos;t know , but we don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Well , we want to find out how to find the data on the page , and we &apos;re trying to find out if we don &apos;t get the data . &quot;
What do you talk about ?
Have you ever been to tell you about it as if you &apos;re in the same ?
What you &apos;re going to do is tell you that ? &quot; &quot; And they sent me an image of the story in Wor@@ d I@@ od , in Wor@@ d I@@ od .
It did .
( Applause ) They &apos;re very good people .
Now , the printing press is one of the methods that we write to write and write and write a letter .
CA : So , you can make the well-being of the organization ?
JA : Yeah , they also work very , very much for all the people , and they &apos;re going to be the future of engineers .
We &apos;ve cut the news news that we &apos;ve been trying to preserve the public interest in the last few months to preserve our passions to preserve our passions .
That &apos;s a little problem .
We &apos;ve got a lot of people who are starting to take care of each of us as a new role in new ways , and even if we have a lot of information , we don &apos;t have access to all of those data .
CA : Do you want to go back to the question of the main flute players , or whether or not a magazine or a magazine ?
JA : Yes . People we believe .
The data that happens in our English is a very different way of investing in a very different way , because we need people to deal with the dangers of the poor .
CA : Can you tell the reason why ?
But if you &apos;re a little bit of mine , you don &apos;t change in 37 schools .
Right ?
JA : My friends were a film , and I had no religious experience .
( Laughter ) CA : Psycho@@ logists have been doing this carpet .
JA : What do you do ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : Because I knew I knew you were young in young age , you could also be the problem with images .
JA : I was a journalist .
I was one of the senior prime lists .
And I had to see when I was in the young age of mine .
You need to make a little probability for monkeys .
It &apos;s possible to make different kinds of things .
Unfortunately , most of us , most of all of us who don &apos;t have the name in Russia for Russia .
No , it &apos;s not like the sun .
CA : Well , I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve been thinking about how many of you , who do you want to spend your own capital ?
You can give you a quick information about them , or why do you talk about it ?
JA : H@@ oo@@ kie , I think .
But my real value is : I think it &apos;s good for people who have access to people who have access to food .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from people who are very , very much like my father .
CA : You don &apos;t create a charter , a community that doesn &apos;t create a community .
JA : I &apos;m a little bit scared , and I don &apos;t show them exactly what &apos;s going on , and I don &apos;t show it — I don &apos;t show them — I &apos;m trying to preserve the people with love .
And this is the kind of character I &apos;ve been for a long time .
CA : Can you talk about it in the last couple of minutes , right ?
And the data that you publish there was the problem with the band , and the news coverage of separation of information .
But in fact , it became the product of the page .
You created your name . And then what happened ?
JA : This was a big deal .
It was the economy of the economy .
It was one of the largest insect survivors in the world .
L@@ ate minimum grade was 10 times more than another decade .
We published this data in the last year .
It was five of clubs . It was five of us who had been on television , like in the movie , who was five years old , and he didn &apos;t know what he was going to do , and he didn &apos;t know what he was going to say , &quot; I don &apos;t know what ? What ? What ? What ? What do we do ? &quot;
And instead , we published the plague , we published the plague , and we &apos;ve got a lot of protection , even we talked about it .
And every single one of these people would never deal with this one would never deal again . And as I &apos;ve met a few hundred years of meeting black black men , a new law was introduced by a new mission of law enforcement , which is one of the most fundamental legislation in the world , which is one of the most effective legislation in the world , which is one of the most effective legislation in the world .
In fact , the opposite of the United States has been able to get into the system of other strains .
And one month ago , this law was considered hidden in the U.K.
CA : Go ahead .
( Applause ) So let &apos;s take the 21st century .
How do you believe that if you believe that you &apos;re going to be doing that ? You don &apos;t know if people will be able to do anything in a secret way , if you don &apos;t know , people will die ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s going to happen .
All around the world — from Asia and the United States and the United States , has always been to rise to the class of legislation and the same .
It &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s a very interesting time we &apos;re living . We can change everything .
CA : Well , if you feel that our religion wants to tell you what our religion is doing , Julian is an assumption .
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m a printer .
I want to tell you a little bit about storytelling , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the story about this story , and I want to tell you about a little bit about what &apos;s called an honor .
But let me tell you that if you don &apos;t start to start , let me tell you about my own story .
Now , I &apos;m just using words , an engineer — from the data to the rest of the year .
And in the valley , in the Fren@@ chman , in the Fren@@ chman .
And then I have my parents and my parents , and I &apos;ve come to my mother , and I &apos;ve come to my mother .
I grew up as a single child , as a single child .
In the 1970s , in the 1970s , it was very bizarre .
Most of our families , many of the family members who were in our lives , who were a senior woman , who was the woman who was a divorced woman .
Actually , I grew up in the middle of two women .
On the side side , the world was the world , the world , of modern , hunting .
On the other side side of the other side , there &apos;s always a lot of religious people , religious , less fought , less fought .
And when I was looking at the opposite , it struck me that he was looking at a very different way to make eye eye eye@@ glasses , to make eye eye glasses .
People who were in their hands , in their hands , were people who were in their hands .
Every time my father was in the middle of my grandmother , in the middle of the first time , he would wake up to get rid of the girls &apos; 60s .
And then it would go to the block .
A week later , a week after a week .
I know that if I tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that there are no people who are going to take care of them , but I &apos;ve never seen anyone who &apos;s going to take care of them .
I said , how did that stop ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s a lot of prayers , but it &apos;s the power of all the data . &quot; &quot; And in the middle of my studies , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons , if you don &apos;t want to do anything in life , if you don &apos;t want to do anything in life , if you don &apos;t want to do anything in life , if you don &apos;t want to do it .
It &apos;s a product .
Every single one of us now is the soci@@ al and the descendants of all of us .
We all agree .
We are born in a very common family , and we &apos;re born with birth .
But if we don &apos;t interact with a world where we don &apos;t interact with the world , we don &apos;t even know if we can communicate .
We can &apos;t afford to be able to afford our economic power . We all know that we &apos;re going to lose a lot of our lives .
Our friends , our coworkers , our business , our work , our way our family , and so many times , if we &apos;re going to push us and look like many times , our essence is very clear .
And as I say , women like my father in Turkish are doing something like a piece of paper , and they &apos;re kind of wrapping it up with a piece of paper , or a laugh for the day .
It turns out that there &apos;s this kind of belief that a man can come from believing that a man has a lot to look for a lot .
But even though it &apos;s weird , it &apos;s one of the largest people of the world who are sharing ideas that are similar to people who share ideas .
And it &apos;s everywhere everywhere , between liberals , liberals and politicians , and in the middle , in the United States , in the United States .
We &apos;re going to get into information , and the kinds of things that we &apos;re going to do in other kinds of things .
And I think that the fact that this isn &apos;t the main way that the printer will be in vaccines .
And if we can &apos;t distribute the boundaries of the boundaries of the masses , we can &apos;t track the border .
And we can see from these things that we can see from these crazy worlds .
I started writing stories from eight .
One day , my mother gave me a color in the color , and he said to me that he would have a good idea .
Now , I &apos;m thinking about that when I thought about it , I thought I had a little fear .
My brother@@ -in-law was good for my family , but I didn &apos;t talk to my friends , but I didn &apos;t talk to my friends .
And I was a kid who was going to take me off the details of the past , and I had to ask myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a kid , I &apos;m a kid , I &apos;m a kid . &quot; &quot; Now , my mother would think that I had a good idea .
But he didn &apos;t know that my life had been deeply bored by my life , and what I wanted to do was write my life on my life .
It wasn &apos;t about the answer , but I began to write about other things about others .
And so I started to write this way .
First of all , I &apos;ve had a story of other people who have been more than the bus for me than the vehicle for writing .
Now , let me tell you a little bit : this is the event that I &apos;ve been talking about in my life .
This led to another rabbi .
My mother was diplomatic .
And I was at the same time , in the same time , at the same time , when I came out of the middle school , I woke up in the middle of the middle school , where I was in the middle school , I was in the middle school .
The first time I had to make a statement here , I was forced to pretend to be &quot; &quot; The typical foreign foreign . &quot; &quot; I had all the years of democracy in the middle of the classroom , and the fact that we could have been a democracy in the middle of the classroom .
In fact , when kids were in this neighborhood , kids were not their self-esteem , they don &apos;t know themselves .
We &apos;ve looked at the United States , and it was also fun , and it &apos;s fun to deal with a bad rope , and from listening to a bad attack .
And so , as I was like , I &apos;d always been surrounded by men , always hurt .
And so I was very good at this school when I was in this school , when I was in the middle of the Turkish gun , and he had to kill the British gun , and he put a 10@@ 0 billion watts of music .
( Laughter ) When I was a time , I had a consensus about how I went from my hometown of school .
I saw the first time in this school , in this school .
They asked me to ask about the question of &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues &quot; &quot; question about &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues &quot; &quot; — they said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve never asked them , &quot; &quot; they did all kinds of things .
And I learned here , I learned here , I learned about three varieties , and this was the magic .
After the Span@@ i@@ iner , Germany , Germany and again , came back .
I &apos;d like to think that the only way that I was in my natural world , and I thought I had to think that the only way that I was in the way that I was in the way that I was in the world .
Now , I &apos;m worried about a feeling that I &apos;m worried about , my case , and the hopelessness , the sense of hopelessness .
In the Istanbul of my 20 years , I was in Istanbul city .
I lived in a very hostile environment and living in a living environment , and I wrote some of my romance .
And I was in the late 1990s when I had a funeral .
I &apos;ve seen what I &apos;ve seen when I saw the first three years when I got out of school .
He was a feeling , an old sa@@ iler , who would never sell in the store , who would never sell her .
The long term , in the blink of the eye , was sitting in front of the screen to transmit to transmission .
And I saw it made by a stranger who was made out of the bed of a bed with a bed , who made it clear to me , and the answer is , &quot; &quot; The answer is , the answer is , &quot; &quot; which is the answer to which I think about — a week from a week ago .
And when we hear about the world and the rest of us , we &apos;re going to have the world that we &apos;re going to do with the rest of our world , and we &apos;re also one of us .
But I &apos;ve always believed that the stories of everyday stories would be similar .
I don &apos;t want to tell you to tell you that it &apos;s powerful , but we don &apos;t want to know a good novel , but we don &apos;t even know if we &apos;re very good ideas , and sometimes we start to recognize the people that we don &apos;t have good ideas .
And then I went back to the captain of my life , and then I went to the girls .
It &apos;s not only the geographical , but it &apos;s a total change in language .
I started writing English .
I &apos;ve also had to tell you that I have to tell you why I &apos;m not writing the word &apos; cause . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s why I don &apos;t want to change myself in English .
I &apos;m not going to write a word in Turkish , and my writing becomes more ethical and spiritual . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , I think it &apos;s more magic and more .
I think I think I &apos;ve got different kinds of connections .
As a million people across the world , I &apos;ve learned later that English is a state of English .
Now , when it comes to a language , it &apos;s always an un@@ supervi@@ sed when you learn to learn .
As we later , as we later , we want to make the better words , we want to make better words , we want to do better things , because our brains and our language are larger .
This is the difference .
But if we learn to fear it , it can be self-@@ present .
This was what I learned when I studied — that I was living in the hallway , and it was a place .
Every time I had a tendency to spend my time in my daily journal , I had a tendency to go back to my father &apos;s journal , and then I had to go back to the idea that I had to come back to the idea that I had to come back to the idea .
My God , for love .
( Laughter ) But instead , I went to try to figure out how to do it .
And so I began to go out and see if my lifestyle had been a choice between Istanbul and Istanbul .
I &apos;m a piece of mine , and I think it &apos;s a physical and decep@@ tive view .
It &apos;s like my stories all around me and my stories to keep my bits and pieces .
And I think that I think that the story of the story is that when you deal with more than a story , it loses its own voice .
So I &apos;d like to think about it with you .
One of the things that I wrote in English was one of the things that I wrote about as a result of literature .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You could write a little differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s see if you go on the front of you , most of you have a lot of names , the U.S. , but there &apos;s one species , which is one of them , and it &apos;s a person who &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a person . &quot; &quot; And it was normal for me to tell me , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to say . &quot; &quot; But what I &apos;d like to tell you is
But I also know that I &apos;m always going to keep it .
He wanted me to be my personal life .
He wanted me to call the book because I was a species .
We talk about stories of stories about the world , and we can see the stories of the politics of the politics that we can see , and then we can see the stories of politics .
Many of you who are not even decided to be able to communicate this phenomenon .
If you &apos;re women from Islam to say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re women from Islam to talk about the name of Islam , you &apos;re going to be better than if you don &apos;t have women .
More informa@@ tive stories , you know , you &apos;re sad , you &apos;re not going to be able to go back to the typical story of the typical story .
And when I was in prostitution , I &apos;m saying that the world has been in literature .
There are designers who have friends who are friends , not like people who are members of society , but they look like a few writers from a few writers from a few writers from India , one of the writers .
It &apos;s not the difference that we don &apos;t know .
In 1987 , when I took the Internet , and I asked him questions about homosexuality , I asked him about a couple times about homosexuality .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re not going to see it as a blue printer , and it &apos;s the right now , and it &apos;s said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t see anything else in other circumstances ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have anything else in other people ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have anything else that &apos;s ever been on . &quot;
There &apos;s a tremendous amount of innovation that has never been made from the rest of the year .
About 10 years ago , the first hundred thousand years ago , it &apos;s very good for me .
We had three printers , one of my three friends , one of the things that happened in the United States .
( Laughter ) But we all came together to put us together , and we don &apos;t even have the name of literature .
We were alone .
They wait for the real stories of writing stories .
It &apos;s a unique function .
This is not just anonymous printers , but they become more of a larger mass .
Now , I &apos;m not sure that the story doesn &apos;t exist , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
All around the world .
For the first time , I saw this in the last time , in 2009 , in 2009 .
And I was working with the eye of women , and I was a city about my family , and I wrote a lot about my family .
And I had a little story , a little story , a small story .
There are some people who I &apos;m writing about — I &apos;ve written about my father , who I &apos;m writing about prostitution .
But I would like to point out to each other , which is just literature .
It &apos;s a story .
I don &apos;t want to go back to what I &apos;ve seen when I &apos;m thinking about &quot; &quot; Spir@@ it &quot; &quot; when I saw it .
You can &apos;t see how long it &apos;s not to deal with the rest of your life .
They &apos;re known to be recognized , and they &apos;re recognized that the political books are important today , not the language of literature .
This is the phrase : &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the story of the story of the story , &quot; &quot; which is the opposite of the story of the story .
And the icon of an icon is an artist . &quot; &quot; The politicians divide us from each other .
One is clear .
It &apos;s the difference .
One is the front .
It doesn &apos;t meet .
The black world has made it .
It &apos;s the water fluid .
They had to say , &quot; &quot; Non@@ sense &quot; &quot; called &quot; &quot; Sleep . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; They would say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how many stories .
They &apos;re changing their sounds in order to express different objects in the story .
It was the first time to listen to him , people who , even more than people , politicians , celebrities .
He@@ ath@@ en has the boundaries of the border , the Middle East , the coast of Central Africa , the Balk@@ ans , the Balk@@ ans .
Today the stories are continuing to survive .
They don &apos;t listen to each other when they talk to each other , but they don &apos;t listen to each other , but they don &apos;t sit on a different day , but they don &apos;t read the word &quot; &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; which is a letter of a Japanese printer .
We need to compromise us further .
If you don &apos;t do it , it &apos;s not good .
Books didn &apos;t tell me that books and shame and shame .
But there &apos;s also a total cost of books .
And then the printer and the fireworks of my own soul had to go back to the book of the first job , and then the first job was to make the book of the first job in the water .
To say , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell you , we can &apos;t make it go away from ignorance , ignorance more than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The challenge of today is not a lack of protection of the problem today , we think about ourselves as we know about ourselves . We don &apos;t know about ourselves , we &apos;re going to get rid of ourselves , and we don &apos;t get away from ourselves , and we don &apos;t know .
I mean , I mean , I think it &apos;s kind of like a computer .
One of the elements of the computer is fixed .
The next one is a permanent Greek man .
That &apos;s how I work .
Part of the work that I wrote about writing is the opposite of the Turkish state , which is the opposite part of the world , and part of the other part is that , among other states , there are communication .
And I think it &apos;s also a very common sense of how I think about my work , but I believe that there is a belief that there are places .
You know , you &apos;re seeing the meeting of the meeting , you know , you see the World Wide Web .
There is a place called a &quot; &quot; Bl@@ ank Brothers , &quot; &quot; which is a place called Bl@@ ank .
That &apos;s where the buildings are .
I &apos;m very sorry about this .
We don &apos;t believe that arche@@ ologists have to believe .
We &apos;ve made sure that I think that I think we &apos;re not allowed to get rid of the parts of the way that I &apos;ve been dis@@ enchanted from the end of the world .
And I think that scientists have to be the honor of artists who are looking for .
I &apos;m going to tell you that when I &apos;m writing it , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m writing the most .
I love to think about after 10 women .
I love to tell my flaws .
I can write a woman about women in one of my sisters . &quot; &quot; And it will be a great possibility of a woman who &apos;s very likely to be happy .
We can write about everything from us .
Au@@ do L@@ ore@@ n says , &quot; &quot; I think our intelligent ancestors says , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a moral .
And I don &apos;t want to deal with that , which is why we &apos;re talking about stories about things that you know about when you learn about it .
Perhaps not very good for this .
It doesn &apos;t depend on what we know , what we know , what we know about , how we know .
We need to teach people to write about what we &apos;re seeing with our cities and each other .
We need to recognize other worlds that we have to recognize .
It &apos;s kind of like diving into the tracks of the mountain .
They &apos;re not hanging out from the political state , they &apos;re together , and that &apos;s good news .
I &apos;m going to finish my face with my father , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s know if we &apos;re friends , we &apos;re going to be friends . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
My great idea is a small idea that it &apos;s a small idea that it &apos;s a small idea that we can &apos;t afford .
That &apos;s the small idea .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here are the women who belong to the A .
They &apos;re women .
So I &apos;ve lost the value of the past .
Two years ago , I lost my grandfather .
I was a little bit tired , and I &apos;m not right now .
I started to understand that Yu@@ ten &apos;s worth of meaning .
And I &apos;ve been studying my journey , who I &apos;ve been studying , and I &apos;ve talked to you about the only way that you can &apos;t cook more product , that &apos;s normal to be normal .
( Applause ) This is the translation of women .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be the most essential .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s very clear because it &apos;s very clear that men to sleep .
And when I came up with a person who was a person who was a person , it was about four or four hours .
Now , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You know , I didn &apos;t say .
If it was about five hours of time , it would be more interesting ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , many of the guys who have less than the boys would put on the floor .
Now , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; &quot; Well , if you want to go to the sky , some of you want to take your morning and ask them , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like 8 ? &quot; &quot; And if you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s going to do is you &apos;re going to play a little bit . &quot; &quot; And if you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , well
We can &apos;t afford it .
Not to be good leaders , no good leader , no good leader .
Sometimes it &apos;s hard for us to do .
And I think that Le@@ hman Brothers , who was the CEO of Le@@ hman Brothers , who was the CEO of the Great Leader .
( Applause ) When girls were seven hours of time , seven hours of time , seven hours of night , seven hours of night , and they could figure out what he would do .
It &apos;s the best part of our life that we &apos;re not sitting in , which is useful for our lives , which is useful for our lives , which is useful for our lives , which is useful for our lives .
Let me just show you that when you &apos;re in the middle of the door , you &apos;ll find the power of the gates in your door to see the big ideas in your door .
Thank you very much .

The brain is the brain disease — because it is schizophrenia .
What &apos;s the problem ?
With Dr. Fran@@ kie Ben@@ z .
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know what people are considered to be normal .
I learned that I was in my brain .
I was like a kid who was a kid , as a kid .
If you &apos;re familiar with your brain , you can see that the brain is about two .
This is the ultimate part of an honor .
The right hemisphere is parallel processing .
It was taken by two sides .
Now , a lot of different things do think about different things .
Give me a moment . Thank you very much .
And when you think about the right brain , we think about the activity of our body .
By the same time , the whole notion of how much of all of the senses would look like this , how it looked , how it looked , how it looked , and how it sounds , how it sounds , and how it sounds .
We are a vibrant energy in the middle of our lives , and we &apos;re also very energetic .
This is the stage , the perfect and the eye .
Our left brain is a whole other place .
And the left is the way we think about it .
The left is prepared for the left , and the next two , which are made out of the end of it .
And the left brain is thinking about a language .
The horizontal world is associated with our external world .
This is the voice : &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to get back to the middle .
And when we say , what we need to do is drill down .
So , I thought , well , I was in love .
It &apos;s true of reality — what do you do — what do you do with your business — what do you do .
I feel like I &apos;m feeling slow motion .
And when we were trying to make a shower in a chicken shop in a shower .
I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t feel mixed with atomic molecules and molecules .
And the only thing I could do was the total energy of total energy .
And what if I said , &quot; &quot; What if what happened to me ?
All my work is , all my work , and all my work , all my work , all my work .
I feel disappointed .
Just bring it down .
It felt .
And my left brain is back to the rest .
And I &apos;m right now .
My brain says , &quot; &quot; Whoa !
( Laughter ) And then he came to cry , which says , &quot; &quot; Re@@ ality , I &apos;m too busy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t have time to be . &quot;
I need to tell you , instead , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking .
I &apos;m trying to make sure .
And when I returned back and forth , I &apos;d run out of these numbers .
So , I &apos;ve got a stroke of the number of numbers that I &apos;ve ever made , that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to make a call .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , I &apos;m talking to you .
What I &apos;ve been doing is my life and my life .
And with my brain , my brain , between reality , between reality , between reality and between reality .
How is it great to my life ?
Or , if you &apos;re alone , I &apos;m going to be able to liberate the heat .
If we choose to manage our right brain , we can choose to manage our brains .
