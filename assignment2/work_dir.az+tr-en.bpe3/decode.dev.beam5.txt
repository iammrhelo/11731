I was 11 years old , in the morning , in the middle of the morning , I &apos;m glad to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
The BBC was listening to the BBC for the BBC .
We didn &apos;t know that we had never been used at all , because the news is that the news is about it .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban came back ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Taliban came back ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t realize what this was to say , but I could see how my father was happy .
&quot; &quot; Now you can go to the original school . &quot; &quot; And he said .
I &apos;d never forget anything .
Learning to work in real school .
I had six years old when the Taliban had been in the middle of the war , I had six years old .
So , after the next five years , I had to go back to a secret school to go back to a secret school to go back to secret school .
And that was the only way we could have education in our two years .
Every single day we went across a different way every day .
We would drop our books in their bags bags , just like we did .
It was a house in a house , in the middle of a little hotel .
He was comfortable , but he would have been a little bit miserable .
We know that our grandparents and fathers and grandparents would have to make our lives .
Sometimes , for the Taliban , the Taliban were connected to a week .
But we did not know what we knew about ourselves .
What if you see it ?
Do we live ?
We would go , but again , we wanted to be a school .
I was actually very lucky to grow up in education , and I grew up in a family who would spend the rest of their lives .
My father was a man who was proud of his life .
In a very different way , a different thought of a living in a very different way , the daughter , my mother , my mother , to go school for school , and they could see that even more than that .
But my mother had been trained .
Ooh .
Two years ago , we went back to a school and went to a school for women and women .
And it was — that was the first difference — the first difference in my family .
And then left the girls , and her kids didn &apos;t have any education , but even though the Taliban are in danger , let &apos;s take the alarm .
For him , she was more safe to get educated .
The Taliban come in the early days , and if we had time , I would have time to see , I would like to see without having to see a light in the future .
I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t tell him , &quot; &quot; Listen , I &apos;m sorry , you could lose anything else in your life .
You can make a minimum wage . You can put it in the middle of war .
But it &apos;s the only thing that we &apos;re going to do with you , and if you want to pay attention to the school , we &apos;re going to be able to buy a car , and if you want to pay the school , we &apos;ll be rewarded .
Now , right ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 22 years old ?
I grew up in a country in a country that has been distributed across decades .
You know , I &apos;ve got less than six percent to go middle school , and if my age of education , I wouldn &apos;t go to the middle school , so I wouldn &apos;t have it .
So , in fact , I &apos;m not here , I &apos;m not going to be here in your brother &apos;s brother .
( Applause ) And when I went back to the rest , one of the people who took me the first time to go to school , was my father who was sent to school .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m the first woman , but I &apos;m the first woman who &apos;s going to walk on a car .
( Applause ) I believe my inspiration is .
I have the insects , for my family , for my family .
So , I &apos;m like , I &apos;m an ambassador of a global ethic that &apos;s going to be trained to teach women .
It &apos;s a big deal of that , in a country where women went to school in a country where women go to school , and in a country that &apos;s been risky .
And that &apos;s the most mundane thing that I see in the school , which is the fact that I could benefit from the opportunities in schools .
And I see the parents , as my father , my father , my father , the father of their father , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to see how my father would join their daughters .
Like , I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true , and I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s real .
About a month ago , with a success , with the captain of the world , the way that we came from a few minutes away from dying in the road , a few minutes separated from dying .
And he played the phone , and the phone rings on the phone , and he would continue to go to school , to go to school and go to school .
And he said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re like 20 , kill me now , kill me . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to fear the future of the future . &quot; &quot; And what I &apos;ve discovered was that I &apos;m not going to fear the future of the future . &quot; &quot; And what I &apos;ve discovered was that every single one of us could be able to preserve the value of the rest of each and every one of us .
That doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t have the destruction of our grandparents .
But in fact , the ancestor of the ancestors of girls who believe girls will believe that girls will believe their future future futures .
The number of girls would have spent a hundred years when the Taliban had a number of girls , as you could , as you know .
But right now , the number of girls in Afghanistan are more than three million people .
( Applause ) It looks very different when it comes from the United States .
I think what they &apos;re seeing is what they &apos;re going to change on .
I &apos;m afraid to take this change after the United States of the United States .
But when I went back to peace , my parents would grow up when I was in the middle school , and when I met the parents , my parents would increase my balance , and my default matter is my own .
For me , it &apos;s the country , and the border is the country , and the girls who read it , and the girls read it to me every day .
And they &apos;re creating great fantasies like me .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to dive into the middle of the world , and everyone who has these cute people who are holding it down for about two half hours .
And you can see the vibrational patterns here , but all of them , with a world of art for art .
It &apos;s hollow , subtle , unblinking .
And these cute shit .
My favorite is a hybrid design .
All right , every dive is sculpture .
This is the unknown world .
They &apos;re underwater , underwater waterfall .
It &apos;s a place where it &apos;s going to go underground , and it comes from one another .
And the female actually sees the more likely to get less of the female .
It &apos;s another time . Watch it . Watch on the right , the network on the left .
A name is a step back , divided by the size of the capital .
Love . I love to love . This is an engineer .
Watch their tentacles . You can take them out . It makes them look like seaweed .
It &apos;s an opportunity .
This is the game that &apos;s moving around . We learn a lot about the water .
And a spray . Isn &apos;t that incredible ? Now Roger him was afraid .
And then , in order to say , &quot; &quot; Ooh , ooh , seen seen .
That &apos;s when the best thing gets possible when it is possible .
Sat<unk> es . We &apos;ll go back to the rest .
One . Three . Three .
In fact , you know Kim Il &apos;s history &apos;s history &apos;s history .
Everything changed how much it is .
When we see the first city of same-sex marriage , when we saw the first public life , if we saw the first public experience , when we saw the first public life , the first time you saw the public phenomenon , the first time you saw the public event , the first time you saw the public event .
And I didn &apos;t hurt .
I don &apos;t know from my mind now .
So , here &apos;s another one , which is different from the body .
The front is a part of the border .
As an architect of suicide , as an architect of suicide .
And I could send back to the rest of me .
And I asked questions for question .
If they were worried about anything , every single thing about anything .
And I had to answer questions .
A policeman worker one of his police workers .
Most of you have been held by Chinese police .
Now , I was very lucky , I was very lucky , as I was very lucky , as a lot of Parliament .
And then , after making a new language , then they could have all the lives of all life .
We don &apos;t live in South Korea .
We were the Honors , but after the 6.7 years , it &apos;s not because of the 6.7 years .
Do you don &apos;t live my village ?
So I started the plans of how to feed them .
And I came across the right way to go back to the island .
I &apos;m not going to deal with the word in China .
I &apos;ve got to stop thinking about it , and I don &apos;t think about it .
I was struck by the front lines .
But for short , after the Lazarus share on the surface of Lagos , but soon , but soon after the Lazarus share on the Lazarus share .
But we had begun to zoom in , but I was very lucky to be in the middle of a time .
Nobody I ever met .
I explained that he would have been paid for prison .
My life &apos;s my life &apos;s my life .
They start with less money and less money .
I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m not going to have TED .
This is what we &apos;re designing in 2009 .
We were in the form of consciousness .
It &apos;s going to go back to the sand without the right .
And if you &apos;re saying , you know , kids like an paintbrush .
It looks like this .
What do we do ?
The puppet said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the trees to happen . &quot;
But I said , &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re not possible , how do I think about your village ?
The kids are falling on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not the victims of the government , and they said .
We &apos;ve made an idea of what I was thinking about .
There are three brothers there .
These grandkids gave us the invention we call .
But right now , it &apos;s used by other purpose .
They &apos;re saving over the bag .
The kids are raised in the process .
( Laughter ) Sometimes it &apos;s a tree , sometimes a tree of 40 to 40 .
This is the boy that you see in the sky that you can see .
( Laughter ) Every time a time , they sit in the village , they sit in the village .
It looks very cute .
( Laughter ) They &apos;re kind of looking out for the fruit .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve been able to make it possible , because we &apos;re not just under the middle of my children , but not only underneath .
And it turns out that my mountain is very high , but you can see the ceiling .
This is where you &apos;re going to take — there &apos;s all kinds of water .
You can see that you can see your friends in the middle of childhood pipes , and you can go back to the water . That &apos;s the normal .
But what you see is that the boys don &apos;t take a drink , and with the water with water .
( Laughter ) It would be a total open line , a whole day .
There is no religion in the desert .
And that means that you &apos;re an archive of it .
There are no corners .
There are no TVs .
Most of those kids start to go back to a little bit .
But there is no reason to get involved in this .
Because there are no corners .
It says that if you don &apos;t want to be in the room , you can go back to the chair .
Relationally , it &apos;s going to go back to the rest .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do when kids like that .
And then they go back and back again .
This is the process .
Secondly , we can make it very important for the sound .
You know , kids put better on the table .
They don &apos;t sleep .
They &apos;re in the middle of a high school and a graduate student in the classroom .
You know , our partners are growing up in the cockpit .
They need it .
You know , you can &apos;t talk to your friends with your friends .
You don &apos;t .
Now , you know , we &apos;re trying to do anything .
And it &apos;s okay .
We &apos;re going to talk to the number of things that we &apos;re going to take in the middle of 20 degrees centigrade .
But we &apos;re hitting it .
It &apos;s about 50 degrees Fahrenheit .
We don &apos;t have water .
We don &apos;t see .
So we &apos;ve got to go back to fish .
We need to act with kids .
Here &apos;s how it works .
They &apos;re actually helping people .
But they don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) So , this is what &apos;s going on .
This is a city hotel .
And this is the driver .
They &apos;re very uncomfortable here .
There are older people in the audience .
It tries to keep the fruit on top of the glass .
( Laughter ) More fruit . ( Laughter )
Every conceivable hotel in the room , if it doesn &apos;t happen .
Santa Claude from here .
And this is what happens , and it &apos;s built up on the floor of the stratosphere .
It has five yards away , and it &apos;s about seven .
We have a lot .
We need to give people an idea .
We &apos;ll give a boy to a boy for a boy .
They work .
Boom .
It &apos;s a great story .
It &apos;s the strength . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) Here it is , it &apos;s looking at how much less it is from the tree .
And then we ran other kids .
You know , it &apos;s a lot of people .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s trying to learn how to drive the driver .
Even if you &apos;re less or less or less for kids .
They learn how to help each other .
It &apos;s a community that is a community , and we give them access .
This is the opposite of a boy that &apos;s a little boy from the top 10 to 30 to 30 .
It &apos;s 183 .
Not a little bit .
So , this is a little tiny bit of height , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit .
But it &apos;s still hard .
They &apos;re moving up to the middle of the kids , and the kids are moving on a daily basis .
They &apos;re going to be very high resolution between kids in the middle of the room .
It always says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m proud of them . I &apos;m not proud of them .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to put on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They go .
In my opinion , I don &apos;t have to protect them with the time , and they don &apos;t have to protect them .
They have to take a little bit .
Because it will teach them how to live in life .
And I think that the meval Earth has to change the lives of people .
This building is one of those buildings to change the lives of kids .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the 1970s , I was in the mid-1980s , in the mid-1980s , in the mid-1980s .
And in the first grade , I &apos;d like to take the last year in the middle of the U.S. , and I went on to go back to school .
But my brother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And my parents wanted me to not be engineers .
It was one thing that came out after my school , and it &apos;s the only way that you could be good and safe .
I don &apos;t love my work .
But my aspiration was to become a Chinese opera .
This is what I &apos;m going to play in .
To be a city , I need to be doing with tears to become a city , and I spent my time in the middle of the opera .
I wrote a letter from the school to prepare radio to the school .
But I didn &apos;t wake up .
Nobody believes it .
But my friends would be to join me with me , and my friends were free .
So , I was struck by 15 years old .
My ambition was not a reality .
I &apos;m afraid that I &apos;m going to be happy because I &apos;m going to take a second speaker to the end of my life .
But it was injustice .
I decided to find another way .
I &apos;m not going to show me the way to show me ? No .
I made my books .
In order to come back to the lecture , I made a book by my music family , and I made a book called &quot; &quot; The Fou Leai family . &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve got a lot of advice from the city of football . &quot; &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve learned that if I had to take a campaign from the name of &quot; &quot; Javier . &quot; &quot; &#93; This book is called &quot; &quot; Changes by Changes . &quot; &quot; &#93; This book , &quot; &quot; Changes by
&#91; &quot; &quot; Duma . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) In the first time , I &apos;d been able to read , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; which was the first book that I saw in the history of New York City , which was the first book in Russia .
Of course , in the fence , it &apos;s a book .
It &apos;s true of &quot; &quot; The Secret Century . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true .
There &apos;s no use for it . I &apos;m sorry .
The Bible is interesting , too .
( Laughter ) This is another day .
But my third self brought me to me in the Enlightenment , and I said , &quot; &quot; You will have the government and the mother . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Hececties , &quot; &quot; which is different and closer to &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot; &quot; And in this way , I had a chance to go back to my dorm rooms , and I had no chance to rebuild my parents .
I didn &apos;t get married to my new civilization .
That would teach you a lot .
For example , this map appeared to me in the first beginning , because we &apos;re working on this map .
I didn &apos;t think that China is not in the center of the world .
Actually , it &apos;s the map of the map .
Not new things .
This is a standard pragmatism world .
In fact , I &apos;ve got a lot of science in my hands where I have to say , &quot; &quot; I have a lot of science . &quot;
And the question is , and the answer is , in fact , it helps .
And I thought , well , why don &apos;t you think that if you &apos;ve ever worked for a company , why don &apos;t you live ?
So I started reading books in the book .
Now , the people who came across the same event , &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin . &quot; &quot; Walter Irene : &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; written : David McCullogh .
&#91; &quot; &quot; This is the &quot; &quot; in the &apos; 60s : &quot; &quot; This is the &quot; &quot; Karkine Graham . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; Bad Buffett : Warren Buffett , Warren Buffett , &quot; &quot; I love a story called &quot; &quot; Warren Buffett . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) In fact , I &apos;d like to read a story about the same stories as a great story — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — (
For Jesus Christ , they were political and political and political .
Now , for sure , these are all sorts of physiology : probability , fear , fear .
And if you know you know , it &apos;s also interesting to read books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Tang Tonang Road &quot; &quot; printer : Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Taio : The water on the water . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I had a lot of interesting things , but I made other interesting things .
For example , I had to deal with the translation of the translation , which means the word &quot; &quot; sonication &quot; &quot; in China .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; Yes .
( Laughter ) And the books are playing , and that &apos;s where books are played with people in times of time .
I know I wouldn &apos;t have any strength or less .
It &apos;s an indication that you can &apos;t really deal with any other people &apos;s suffering .
And I &apos;ve started to believe that the impossible is not the only purpose of the desire .
The main purpose of the compassion is to allow us to communicate with the fact that the aspiration and pleasure and well-being is happening .
The desire to do it is to do this .
And it &apos;s clear to the books that I &apos;m here today , and I &apos;m going to live in a very good idea .
And I say , &quot; &quot; books always have you . &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You take your office , and the bottom line is that you get your food in your hotel room .
It &apos;s just just four .
It doesn &apos;t give us information about how it works .
Today , to work today .
You don &apos;t know . What do you do .
You can go back to your own room , and you said , &quot; &quot; Why am my country ? &quot; &quot; Okay , now it &apos;s morning , and you &apos;re in the middle of the morning , and you &apos;re in the middle of your cabin .
( Laughter ) And this is one of the women who &apos;s more than just a woman who &apos;s been on to tell you .
This morning , I said , &quot; &quot; I would like to take one of those two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to take one of those two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , every day , we would give us the invention .
And I &apos;m talking about something much more valuable than the office .
From time , your time .
In fact , I believe that there is something new to think about what a new disease is .
( Laughter ) From the idea of &quot; &quot; Rira Housing , &quot; &quot; which is to think about the fact that there &apos;s been a really good deal to think about it . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a reflex that &apos;s a reflex — and it &apos;s a reflex , and it &apos;s the click , the click , and says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Silence is important . Right ?
It &apos;s great for every company .
And in a way , there &apos;s really good news about it .
But in the last few years , in the past couple of years , with the technology of the integrated structure and the vast expanse of information integrated into the integrated structure between the integrated information and the vast expanse of the technology of the past few years .
We &apos;re going to cry . ( Laughter ) And the reason why this man is not going to be good for this man , is not that man &apos;s good for a good , no way to think about it .
Actually , I &apos;m sure that DRT of compassion has a global epidemic .
I &apos;m talking to you .
A couple of years ago , I put a video on a video in a couple of years , and I imagined all sorts of malicious titles .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing about five truths to be able to connect the video about five minutes .
This is the monarchy that didn &apos;t train the Transition .
People who don &apos;t know what they were to do .
And it was in the middle of everyone left .
It has to go .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at how quickly it works .
( Video ) This is why our purpose is important to deal with a very important question .
So , as a team , who said , who was a team ?
No , it &apos;s Joille . I &apos;m working on my home today .
( Laughter ) I thank you . I thank you for singing .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a lot of people who want to take the name of the ship , so that we call the text .
As a team , as a team — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — who &apos;s been on the table .

It comes to me .
A few weeks later , a few weeks later , a few decades later , a few people were looking at this video .
And three years later , this video takes place .
If these numbers are millions , millions of views and video users are users .
So I went through the journey of the Internet to find out the objects .
I &apos;m useful to find out how to find useful and use of technology .
And I started working with a 360-year study study , and I started working with some of these students who are happy to have kids in their lives .
In the middle of the middle seven years , there &apos;s only 72.9 years old .
( Laughter )
When you &apos;re in elementary times .
In fact , when they hear people who are blind people , they smile .
It &apos;s one of the simple things .
Which means that it didn &apos;t have a complete relationship from Saudi civilization .
So the final study of the Swedish University of Sweden .
He smiles into understanding his unique condition .
I &apos;ve got to take a habit of people who don &apos;t have a smile or to make a sponge .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Wetz &quot; &quot; in a book called &quot; &quot; The NDD &quot; &quot; in the book .
After all , and then , after all of the sudden , and then we decided to deal with the whole .
This is a theory of theory , and it &apos;s kind of a theory that allows people to feel better about people .
You can make it happen .
( Laughter )
I &apos;m a person who smiles more and more .
And if you don &apos;t have many more calories , you don &apos;t have a higher quality shock , or if you don &apos;t have many more calories , you don &apos;t have sex .
I &apos;m Maykkel . I &apos;m very sorry . I &apos;m okay .
We &apos;re trying to study the claims of <unk> oxide , the marathon , the marathon , the marathon and the nubs , my father , my father , my brother , my mad hand , my mad hand , and like this crazy thing .
In the last time , when you &apos;re alive , you &apos;re going to have things like that .
Some people call us kindness .
But it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of people .
We don &apos;t know if we &apos;re a gambler , and we can &apos;t find them . We don &apos;t really want to deal with our ideas .
So I show you an example of the bad ideas .
I &apos;ve brought it back . This is the data for NBC .
A company called &quot; &quot; The Quarro &quot; &quot; company .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Book of 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Book of 2000 . &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) They went to the University of 900 dollars a year .
It &apos;s a collaborative thing that Radio Shack Shackleton .
Now , you can use to take a lot of things out of devices , but this is a third of the investment in education .
( Laughter ) So it works : if you go back to the choir , if you think about it when it comes to this , you &apos;ll open up .
Something like this .
So I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) Hoom . This is a little bit of feedback .
We &apos;re going to try to experiment again .
It &apos;s so small that we &apos;ll go on .
( Laughter ) Have you ever left your hands .
That &apos;s the question , which is the question : Do you imagine the lettuce in your head ?
This is the Cavab : if you opened it up , if you opened it up .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We don &apos;t see the tapir , but we don &apos;t find the tapir .
Now , here &apos;s a number of brief nitrogen , which is , probably , is that they &apos;re not : They &apos;re kind of like Exmosters , the emotional roles and people .
People remind them they don &apos;t find them .
We all set up everything in the hand , and we &apos;re going to do something about it , and we don &apos;t know about it .
And we did .
We took two strains , and we had to put two birds on top of an image , which is an image of a gift .
And the test scores were 50 percent success . ( Laughter ) And we get this result .
This is an interesting , curious example of what we did .
&quot; &quot; Skeptic . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s been published by three months .
This is the future of the future .
People don &apos;t go to go ?
And I have some idea that I &apos;ve got my work on my work . That &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
Every decade , average IQ is three numbers .
It &apos;s hard .
You don &apos;t think anything like a scientific material or a scientific material .
Who and the religion and religion ?
This is a question of how to deal with my hands .
These are two different things .
It &apos;s not the gift , it &apos;s activity .
It &apos;s very good to think about what &apos;s going on .
For all of the phenomena , these are the way you look at these things .
What are you going to see ? The rest of the world , or a lot of environments , a distant way from another 90 , another 90 , which are far from the other galaxy , called cryptography .
This is one of the letters of &quot; &quot; Close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; Photoshop &quot; &quot; for one of them ?
The main question is , ( Laughter ) Now , the main question of what the puzzle is .
We have to make sure that we &apos;re not going to be able to make it happen before we say it .
Which is that even further ? What do you do ? &quot; &quot; And if you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; World Webly , &quot; &quot; where the World Webly said , &quot; &quot; The World Webly Life ? &quot; &quot; The World Webly makes that ?
( Laughter ) So , like this , things like Sidney Hrisin cartoons .
For those who sit in the middle of the Artifada : &quot; &quot; Then you &apos;ll get a great deal .
I think you &apos;re going to make your second battery better . &quot; &quot; This is the slide of all the young design designers .
That &apos;s what this cartoon works .
( Applause ) You can tell you , you can say , &quot; &quot; You can tell you , you know , no matter , no matter , no matter . &quot;
It &apos;s not going to happen .
This is the result of intelligent design for design design .
Sometimes you go away , sometimes they call the dark energy , the dark energy , the dark matter . It &apos;s what we call it .
This is the beginning of the economy for my hands .
This is the idea of designing with the design design , which is the ultimate human being .
The same question comes out . Which is that ?
UFO-right-doxes , don &apos;t have planets , if you don &apos;t know what ?
This is a picture taken from my home from my home to the Alye , from my home to my wife .
This is like a deck network , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s the door .
There &apos;s no Photoshop , high tech , no computer .
This is the pattern that I photographed with &quot; &quot; Kfocal Inc . &quot; &quot; And I photographed this pattern .
If someone came in the village , he was ready .
And the camera was ready .
( Laughter ) Now , many of them may be able to think that some of them would be retainted , or maybe some of the things that are going to do .
And if we take more general , we &apos;re trying to seek out the literature between observations and things .
For example , the telescope has two problems to go to Saturn .
First , there was no theory on the planet .
The second thing was to keep the observations , and so , you know , I didn &apos;t even understand it .
And they wrote this kind : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to see that there were three objects in the first place . &quot;
That &apos;s what he decided to see .
So , without a good clue , you don &apos;t know that good theory is going to make good theory .
This was 165 .
This is a picture of the book called Chizan Housing , which is a book where the employees had to deal with us .
This is the two things that I &apos;m supposed to do , because there &apos;s a great theory of the solar system , and there &apos;s a great theory that we could see , which is the telescope , we understood that the Earth was an paintbrush faster than Saturn &apos;s Saturn .
We could also see the pieces of people with this telescope .
This is the theory of theory .
The bad thing is that the theory of theory knows that there are thousands of people .
And one of the reasons why we don &apos;t believe is that the reason why we don &apos;t believe it is because we &apos;re not allowed to believe it .
Every single time we see it all the time .
This is the opposite .
In 1978 , they wanted to take the same place from NASA-e , which was the first place that people thought were created by the lettuce .
This is a picture taken from January in 2009 .
If you are your eyes , you can do it .
You can make your eyes look at the sky more and more like an image of an image .
Now , I &apos;m saying that you need to look at Haters , because we &apos;ve got to know that they evolved .
It &apos;s important for us to think about it .
And of course , it &apos;s sad . It &apos;s an elevator .
Here you can see here .
( Laughter ) If the astronauts were connected , they had to see the GPA .
You see it . You saw older people who have met the fish ?
Or if they were the elephant ?
Dine icons .
( Laughter ) And in the 1990s , in the late 1990s , in a van .
He would take five dollars to see the nun that she wanted to see , until he had to see the nun , until the Minister of Ternun Terse-Terorestorm .
Here &apos;s Baakan Gupape , and it &apos;s on the floor , and it would go down .
The crowd is very careful that this works , because it &apos;s very careful , because there are people , and you see these images on the surface and see these images on the surface and see those images .
This is the Bao Paauloda in Sao Paulo .
Here &apos;s the Baakir in the middle of the Baakir , and I was able to tell you , I was able to have a dig in the nose of the geese .
( Laughter ) This is 28 bucks to take 28 dollars to get rid of this . ( Laughter )
How do you look like this now ?
Their senses are broken down , in 1949 .
I &apos;m in love with Clearkira .
To see this , I had to do it .
There was a lot of people .
It &apos;s a man who has been a lot of faith , who have come up with great cars .
We &apos;re curious about better .
You know , you know — this is Dawkins , and I &apos;ve got great , two , two , two of them , and we were on the display .
People in the sense of respect for respect .
We went to deal with the beginning of what happened .
It was a picture like this one , which was a picture of the fund and the punk .
This is the Baakir in the other side of the Baakir , and they started to heat .
Every society would be a wonderful thing .
( Laughter ) Now , this is absolutely wonderful . It &apos;s absolutely wonderful .
And I &apos;m going to finish up with another mitochondria that I &apos;m going to finish up with .
There &apos;s a movie called &quot; &quot; Astick . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a film called Maykl Kitten , talking to us .
When we came back , you &apos;re not really going to talk about the fact that you &apos;re going to die .
And it turns out , you know , everybody speaks .
It &apos;s an indicator of the deaths of the dead .
( Laughter ) In this film , it &apos;s in the electronics of these messages .
I &apos;m going to take this from a line from a number of lines .
This is the most popular .
This is the sound of this famous audience .
( Mahmoud says ) If there &apos;s a lot of age , I &apos;m worried .
This is our summer .
If there &apos;s two ways to change the way you get two options .
All day religions .
Now , yeah , let &apos;s hear the translation . Have you ever been able to hear that secret message ?
( Music ) ( Applause )
( Music , &quot; &quot; What do you hear ? What do you hear ? &quot;
The devil ? You know , you don &apos;t know .
Now , you can tell your brain that you &apos;re going to need to recognize what your brain is going to do .
( Music ) It &apos;s possible when we see what happens . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to finish up with a small , cute story .
It &apos;s an informal commercial disaster .
We &apos;re trying to seek very good things .
There is a pop in the United States .
It &apos;s very popular : It &apos;s called Katiis Metrics .
They have very much heat .
It was between five of the best five months in 2003 . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot; &quot; Love is a story of love — the U.K. story — a great story about a million ft .
And it feels like that .
( Music ) From there , we &apos;re going to go back 12 billion light bulbs . That &apos;s what it means . Nobody knows that it &apos;s true .
Announcer : Okay . At least , at least .
It would be in America in America , and it would be &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to have six light points of light . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the book is , &quot; &quot; The Great Wall . &quot; &quot; And the book is , &quot; &quot; The Great Wall . &quot; &quot; And the book is , &quot; &quot; The Great Wall . &quot; &quot; Okay , for a scientific institution .
So , you know , &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; The Guardian . &quot; &quot; There is no way that we can see how far we &apos;re far from the border .
We &apos;re not 12 , 13.7 billion light bulbs , and that doesn &apos;t laugh .
And we all know how much more it is , if you should be able to be able to have a little bit of accuracy .
So , if not all right , we can tell you that it &apos;s very intimate .
Now , you know , after the text , after the language of the text , and then I was very ashamed , and I was very ashamed of astronomy .
I had to keep it .
So I &apos;ll end up with this .
( Music ) From the front lines of the universe , we &apos;re going to go back 13.7 billion light bulbs .
It can be shared in the short story , but this is the closest example .
And so , and so on , I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m always going to tell you , I &apos;m always going to tell you .
( Laughter ) Okay ?
( Applause )
In the 1980s , in the 1980s , in the 1980s , in the 1980s , in the 1980s , you have to have a printer .
This was an example of a product that was written in the machine .
And it would be the government of all the printers .
And in a way , if you think about a piece of paper , you could write a piece of paper .
And we &apos;ve been thinking about the fact that we &apos;ve been able to make a carpet that we &apos;ve been able to think about .
We &apos;ve never succeeded in our own countries .
But this day in the 20th century , every famous brand of a famous brand , you can play a laser , and if you do , you can play a little bit of the yellow line , and you can see that if you take a number of other people , you can play the yellow dots .
This is the reality of today &apos;s reality .
Nobody has ever missed it .
This is an example of an example of an example of what we &apos;re used to believe in our own lives .
This problem is one of three main approaches .
And if you go back to the problem , we &apos;re seeing anecdotal sums of evidence that we see .
This is humanized from three key guards .
The first one , according to the show .
This is a picture like Dang Qulyv , which is a central city .
And it &apos;s not hard to try to understand the benefits of experts who don &apos;t have imagined .
These men have money .
They &apos;re very , very much , very much to pay attention to more money .
Actually , it turns out that millions of workers have seen millions , multimillionaire .
This is the Telecomists of Eonies .
This is Al<unk> Gimack .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is the Bjorn Sunansen .
This is Matthew Digital and the Historic Alc .
These guys are the descendants of these guys , but they &apos;re in the same way that we don &apos;t think about it , but we don &apos;t use it to make money to make money out of our devices while we &apos;re trying to make money to make money , or if we &apos;re trying to take care of our devices , if you &apos;re thinking about it , you can make credit card cards .
Two months ago , two months ago in the U.S. , two months ago , in this picture of the U.S. , in this picture of Sam Jamie , he had 14,11 million U.S. GDP .
And nobody knows that by Sam .
And I think that we need to be more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to imagine the world in the world .
And it turns out that there seems to be more likely to go to the state .
Now , in the future , the vast majority of years will lead to a great deal .
The second big group is not the money that makes it work .
The reason that the reason that this works is that the reason that the reason that this works is , the reason that we can see them is a lot .
And in the last year , as Anonymous , people like Anonymous and advice began to keep the right place .
If I had two main examples of humanists , I would like to tell you that these are the people who have been doing this work for money , like Anonymous , which is the third idea that the government has been in charge , and the third idea is that the government and the magic press .
Let &apos;s look at what &apos;s going on in companies .
This is an example of an obvious example of what &apos;s going on when governments are constant .
It was an exhibition in Didar Hole in Diloar Hole — it &apos;s really — it &apos;s .
And the year before we got frustrated , they landed on a line .
And someone would go into the system , and they &apos;d broken all the system .
And when a week ago , I decided to ask about this question , which was the Dutch , I asked this question about the fact that you don &apos;t believe that there was a person who &apos;s going to die in the middle of the room , and I asked them to believe that there is a human mortality .
He said it .
What happens is that when people are dying , people die ?
The Digital Ditiar Organization .
They are the Delow .
What do they do with ceramics ?
If there &apos;s a little bit of paper , and if you want to use the same time , you need to use this certificate , and you need to use it .
We &apos;ve been using the same as the email or whatever we &apos;ve been doing in the country , but like this , like the daf-2 governments , they use more than the foreign governments , because they don &apos;t believe that SSL is on the other side of these countries , because they don &apos;t believe that SSL password is going to take place because they don &apos;t have the same .
But it turns out that this is the damage that governments have proposed .
It &apos;s possible that their name is possible .
That &apos;s what Diana was going on .
How do you think about it ? How do you deal ?
And in the case , 2011 , when you were in 2011 , they made the middle of a secret police officer , and they made a lot of information when they were looking .
And between those sheets of paper , &quot; &quot; FISNNNR . &quot; &quot; And in this case , the Germans had been in the middle of a company called &quot; &quot; FISNNNR . &quot; &quot; And in this case , there was a set of tools that would allow me to hold all of the communication equipment in the United States , and the software was the line and the programmers .
They &apos;ve sold these tools to feed their destination .
The middle of the company is right there .
In fact , the United States governments are providing devices that allow themselves to allow themselves to sustain their own citizens .
But they &apos;re going to go back to their own behavior .
For example , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , they had to be able to explore their own ritual by the fact that these screws were created .
And if you &apos;re depressed , you &apos;re condemned to all of you , which is your phone .
Now , now it &apos;s incremental .
They &apos;re going to go online .
We can &apos;t hear the tone of your religion , and you can make all the relationships with all your relationships , and listen to your password .
Now , when you talk about the issues like this , a lot of people would say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s not a good job , but I don &apos;t have a good job . &quot;
Why am I worried ?
I don &apos;t have a secret . &quot; &quot; But this is a very good idea .
Mystery is northeast .
It &apos;s not going to sink .
It doesn &apos;t depend on the choice between the poor and the health .
It depends on the choice between prostitution and state .
And if we believe that in the 20th century , we believe that this is a lot of our faith , and the fact that we &apos;ve been successful .
But can you be able to cross the next 50 years in the future , right ?
And the question is , and the questions are going to be the future of the future .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you , thank you . &quot; &quot; Because I was 17 years old .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m in the University of Washington , Washington , University in Washington . &quot;
My age , and my friends were meeting me to listen to me .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re here , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sorry , Johnny , Johnny .
( Laughter ) Imagine you &apos;ve got to imagine that you &apos;re going to have a sense of living in the 17 years .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; This is the medium . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is the whole thing .
And I was looking at glass , because I didn &apos;t understand the sky coming from the ground .
In my age of 17 years , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my God , how did I think ? &quot;
And then I came to understand that , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , and I smile . &quot; &quot; And then I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m proud of it . &quot; &quot; And then I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , and I loved it . &quot; &quot; And then I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , and I loved it . &quot; &quot; And then I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , and I smile . &quot; &quot; And then
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a little bit more than that . &quot; &quot; Now , I would like to tell you that I want to take you on this journey .
And yet , this is what this journey is about .
Now , I believe in the metaphor for our journey , and I want you to think about your own journey .
My journey started from 1977 , in 1977 , in 1977 , when I saw two hundred miles below Goln Gate two hundred degrees Fahrenheit .
But I decided to use it to be able to use it for me to use it .
This is a big thing for California .
This is a big thing that I &apos;ve been living in the Inveral , which is a little bit of a small algorithm that I &apos;m living in the Inveral journal , where 350 grandmothers lived there in the middle of the year .
And I started walking in infantry , and people would walk around .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know what ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you do this , you do this , you do this ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t make us cry , maybe they need me to help you not make us cry .
Because , you know , I didn &apos;t hear all of you .
And I kept talking to people , and I kept complaining about it .
I asked my colleagues to say goodbye .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use any more cars . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know why this was 16 years old .
They lived in Philadelphia .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t need to tell you .
So I decided that I was in eighth birthday , and I &apos;ve talked a lot about a lot — I decided to take a lot — I decided , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about it .
So , I did this .
I didn &apos;t talk about it in the sky .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , this was a wonderful experience for me , because I started listening to that time .
And I had to think about what I did .
Because , I &apos;ve always heard people , listen to people , and when I listen to people , I didn &apos;t listen to the people about what I was talking about .
And when people talk to me and talk about what I &apos;m going to tell you about , I would like to tell you about what I &apos;m going to tell you about .
And then ...
( Applause ) And so soon , it landed in the future .
And that day , I was really listening .
And this was my theme for me , because I didn &apos;t learn about things .
I had 27 , and I thought , I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , for the next day , I managed to explore that for the next day , and then again , as long as this time , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;m going to be able to learn from a year because I had already learned to learn .
So , I didn &apos;t speak a year , and then I thought , maybe I &apos;ll start to rethink some of the things I &apos;ve learned .
But it took 17 years ago .
In this 17th year , I walked around , and I went on the bench , and I went to study the book , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to study the book . &quot;
And I thought , I need to go to education .
In Ashland , I went to Oregon , I went to Oregon .
( Applause )
I went to the office office , and what ?
I &apos;ve shown the axis on the floor .
Ah , what do you want to read ?
Woman ?
We have the special program for you . They did this .
And after two years , I finished the rate of a third .
It was the opposite .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Dear son , my son , we don &apos;t do it , but we don &apos;t know what to do with it .
If you don &apos;t leave the car with your car , if you don &apos;t speak , you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I started walking around and walking again .
I came back to Washington , D.C. , and I decided to go back to the truck from Italy , Idaho from Idaho to Washington , to Washington .
Two years ago , I spent two years in Massachusetts .
Two years out there wouldn &apos;t be bad .
( Laughter ) And it happened , and I got trained in two years of education .
You have two stories of belonging to Montana .
The first one is that , in fact , I had a pnation .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m worried about this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be worried about this . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s going to go back in the morning , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Did you go back to the morning .
If you go to South America , heani ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Hages and lakes .
So I did this .
He said to me back to me , &quot; &quot; Sit , John , John , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; Sit , John , you can use a book of art . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re not allowed to join all the questions from all the professional questions .
And if it &apos;s easy to deal with the very high level , and then it &apos;s going to be clear that if you could solve it , and then it &apos;s going to be clear . &quot; &quot; So , it doesn &apos;t happen .
It was a big deal to help me .
And they would see that my life was very hard for me , and they tried to do it .
That &apos;s when I was tattoo .
I had 13 students when I went on the floor .
And I &apos;d like to tell you that I had to tell you that I had to tell you , &quot; &quot; My name is John Francis . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have any more translation . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the last lesson .
And all of the students who are in the street are ...
( Laughter ) So I would like to see if I had time to go back to it .
But I had to tell you , I said .
After two weeks , everyone would try to join us .
And I learned a lot about this class , and I learned a lot .
I don &apos;t know what John wants to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what — I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t know it , but I don &apos;t know .
No , no . That &apos;s not — it &apos;s not — it &apos;s the user user &apos;s user . &quot;
And one of the most amazing things about it .
You can make someone else .
No , he talks about that choice .
So , this debate came out , and we kept discussing the debate .
I went back to this work and say , &quot; &quot; I left .
But what I learned from learning was something that I learned from learning , and sometimes they would like to make sure that I didn &apos;t get them in theory .
And I thought , if you have teachers and studies , you don &apos;t always teach .
So , I kept .
My father came on my head and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back to the village , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , you have to go back to the city .
What do you think you think about ? &quot; &quot; And I went to the University of Wisconsin , and I went to the University of Wisconsin Wisconsin .
And I wrote about two years old writing interviews .
Nobody was interested in what &apos;s going on .
But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
And I was the only man who wrote about the U.S.
And it came back again .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to do this . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t use it to understand what this is how to do .
My leg said , &quot; &quot; You need to go to the equation , because you &apos;re going to get better jobs , you &apos;re going to push better work . &quot;
I took my banjo , my feet , my feet , my feet to the Atlantic Ocean for seven years , in seven years .
And in the mid-1990s , I started to talk about the U.S.
Now , I &apos;ve made those people who don &apos;t even know if they &apos;re going to go to where trees are going to go to the ground , but if you don &apos;t go to the trees , there &apos;s no man .
And I thanked the orthopedic and my family , because they did it .
And that &apos;s what happens .
And they taught me about how to listen to me — they listened to me .
And that &apos;s something that came out from that column — to listen to each other .
I really believe that — we need to listen to each other .
My journey went on .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is the medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the medium . &quot;
I &apos;ve been working on the Sabbath , I &apos;ve been campaigning , I &apos;ve had no idea for BMI .
For the United States , I wrote to the United States , and I wrote a lot about it .
If someone had told me about 20 years ago , who would you like to do ?
&quot; Yes , I want to make the difference . &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back to the East Side , and go back to the middle of the highway and the right place . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sorry , you want to make the difference . &quot;
What happens ? What happens ?
How do you go and talk about things like the simple things like talking about ?
Now , after the outside day , there &apos;s been a great renaissance .
And then — I said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is a year — I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back and see this work , &quot; &quot; I went back to the middle of a year , and I went back to the fact that I went back to the entire island .
It went out of mind — I want to tell you why I &apos;m starting to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started to tell you why I started
I began to talk to you , I learned from the praise of the prosecutor .
And in that level , I learned that I learned about the fact that I had learned in the format .
And the process of creativity — I have learned about people , and we &apos;re not going to be able to do anything .
And not because of the trees and birds , not just because of the trees and birds , and not because of the trees .
And if we don &apos;t think of consciousness , we think we &apos;re looking at ourselves , and we &apos;re seeing the way we think about each other and each other .
And I wanted to go through that .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I have to go back to other people , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have to go back to the other way , &quot; &quot; which was my husband , and I had worked on it — I came back to my father — I decided to walk .
This story is the result of this story , and I &apos;ve got to get there , and yet , I can &apos;t use it .
I ran through the El Dorado — the prison prison , and my dream of prison — Veda , and I don &apos;t know what happened to me because I didn &apos;t know anything .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Greg , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paver , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paols , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paols , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paols , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paols , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paint , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paint , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paint , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Paint , &quot; &quot; and the Mil
And I said , &quot; &quot; Sophia athletes ?
I don &apos;t have to show you how long I am , I &apos;m not in the nose .
I was the GMT , the doctor , and I went around the world and I left the world .
What did it do ?
It turned out to be on the road .
They didn &apos;t laugh .
What do I say , thank you , what do I say ?
After 150 miles , I came to realize that when I was born , I realized that when I was in the product , I had to come back .
I was in prison , and I had to get there .
I didn &apos;t use it because I didn &apos;t use it .
What happens ?
Because when I started to use my car , I would like to use my car .
But it turns out , I &apos;ve never asked myself , I &apos;ve never wanted to make my decision , but I never want to have any decision to do .
And so I &apos;m going to be the GMT , I &apos;m going to be able to cry .
I &apos;m not a professor I &apos;m not a professor .
And so I came to realize that I just only have more than just only because I &apos;ve only had other options .
You know , we can do that .
I had to change .
And I was afraid to change because I had always taught me to be walking .
Because , I &apos;ve been trained to prison .
I didn &apos;t know who I would be .
But I could be necessary .
I could change it . Because I &apos;m not here today because I &apos;m not here today .
And I know that when we &apos;re very , very time-consuming , but there are other places for us .
We need to go back to where we &apos;re going to have new identities of our identity and where we are .
And I &apos;d like to tell you that you &apos;re going to go back to the next place — where you &apos;re going to go back to the prison — where you &apos;re going to go from prison to where you &apos;re going to go from prison to where you &apos;re going to go from prison to where we are .
We need to change .
And as we said , we need to get back to the destination .
And if my voice is important to tell you if my voice is affected to you , if my people affected to you .
And I know that you can influence me , you can influence me .
Now , let &apos;s go back to the world — let &apos;s go back to the world that we &apos;re going to show you — that we &apos;re going to show that we &apos;re going to show that we &apos;re going to show that at TED when we &apos;re here today .
Because ours is the kind of behavior that we &apos;re treating ourselves , because our behavior is our behavior .
So what you &apos;re going to see is that I &apos;m going to leave you with my niece , and I &apos;m going to end up here in the next five seconds .
Thank you .

You know , if you &apos;re in America , you get closer and closer to what &apos;s going on in America , and the question says , &quot; &quot; Please forgive me ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; This is the Oak &apos;s Oak , and it &apos;s an amoeba .
This is 216th . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s good , what &apos;s good ? &quot;
There are two examples , blocks of blocks , the blocks of the blocks , and they &apos;re looking for a little bit .
Now , imagine if you could imagine , if you could imagine that you &apos;re going to be the right person , if you could do it , if you could do it , this cube is the name of this cube ?
He says , &quot; &quot; This is the blockchain , and this block is 16th , and you say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the name of why ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name ? &quot;
They have names .
Google Mapis . This is 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19
All of these blocks have the names .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you do with your home ? That &apos;s the morning . That &apos;s the morning . This is the morning .
And that &apos;s what I said , &quot; &quot; What if you said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What if you said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re not going to go back to home .
The first one is the number of houses of the first home of the United States .
And after that , it &apos;s two of the number of favorites .
This is a pipeline . It &apos;s an Asante , and I sometimes love the most amazing thing that we don &apos;t think of when we don &apos;t think about it .
For example , what &apos;s going on in the fence is that they don &apos;t care you .
You get money in the months you &apos;re going to die in the months , and if you get sick , you don &apos;t get any money , because they don &apos;t know if you &apos;re healthy .
( Applause ) We &apos;re going to make a sense of &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going back to &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; we call &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; button .
But in the South African music , a piece of music shows you a piece of music .
So , it &apos;s not just because it &apos;s not the only part of them , but two , three , four , four , one .
And this map is true .
Now , I &apos;m also saying that when you &apos;re flat , it &apos;s true , what you &apos;re saying is that India is true .
So we don &apos;t forget about it , and if you &apos;re in the middle of other places , how do you think about it , and if you don &apos;t hear about equality , it might be true .
