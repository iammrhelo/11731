And I was 11 years old . I was in the middle of the city , and in one of the sudden , you know what I &apos;d like to hear in my home .
The NBC , in the exact packaging of the world , has opened the BBC .
And there was a slide that we weren &apos;t used at that time , because the news was about the end of the news .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban went back . &quot; &quot; It was very clear .
I didn &apos;t realize what that meant , but I could see how my father was happy .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you can go in your head . &quot; &quot; He said .
I didn &apos;t know if I could never .
The real high school .
I had six years since the Taliban , and I had six years old for girls .
So in five years , in five years , I had to get a deer , and I had to get a deer in the hidden schools , and then I had to get a deer .
That &apos;s the only way that we can &apos;t get to education .
So every day we visited the way that you &apos;re going to go to the village .
We would bend our books into the bassities , and just think about it .
He was in the school , and he was in a small cottage that was packaged in a small cottage .
He was comfortable , but it would be a lot of cool .
We could have students and women , and our parents , our parents , we knew our life .
Sometimes , for the Taliban , the Taliban were connected by a week .
We were always protecting what we knew about what we knew .
Can you see me ?
Do they know that we live ?
And yet , it was a place where we wanted to be high school .
I was very lucky , and I grew up in a family , and I grew up in a family .
My father was a human being in her own way .
He had a different thinking on the side of his grandfather who lived on the side of his hand , and his father , so that my mother , she was trying to get to school .
But my mother had been educated .
Whoa .
Two years ago , and the girls on the side of our house and girls were helping a school for women and women .
And it was — it was the first one that had to do with his family .
As well , there was no fact that their kids would get educated , and they didn &apos;t have to go to the Taliban security , but let &apos;s take risks .
For her kids to get educated , they were safer .
I would have been in the Taliban , and it would have time for me to see a ray of light , and I would expect to see a ray of light from the future .
He &apos;d come to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m girl , I &apos;m girl , you lose anything in your life .
You can have a little bit of money . You can put your home home in war .
But the only thing that &apos;s going to happen is that if you &apos;ve got to get a handle on the side , and if you &apos;ve got to sell it to school , we &apos;re going to sell it to school .
Now , do I still have to continue ?
I grew up in a country where I grew up for decades .
You know , but if you had less than six percent of my sales , and if I was in the course of my educational progression , and if I was in the process , I wouldn &apos;t have it .
So , in the meantime , I &apos;m here , I &apos;m going to be here , a Mandledbury Collective Collusion .
( Applause ) When I went back to Afghanistan , one of the very first reasons that I had to get to school was my father , who had been sent to school .
It &apos;s not because it &apos;s not because I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m not because I &apos;m the first woman to walk around .
( Applause ) I think it &apos;s amazing .
I have the insects , and my family &apos;s head is more split with my family .
And so , in this case , I &apos;m an ambassador of a global campaign to go to women &apos;s women .
This is a country where women are still risky when women have been risky yet to be risky when women have been risky , and I have a very first time .
And it &apos;s the very basic thing that I have to do with my high school .
And I see how their fathers , as my father did , I see how their ancestors had led to their daughters , as my father did to me .
It &apos;s like Eynest . I don &apos;t know what he &apos;s saying , but he &apos;s the ancestor of one of my students .
Just a month ago , a week ago , when he was visiting his village , he took them a few minutes from Selma to die in his village .
And so he played phones too , and the night on the phone , I went on to go to school , and on the phone , I went back to school .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve been willing , you &apos;re killing me . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; But I don &apos;t know what your village is , and I &apos;m going to tell you what your village is going to protect the future of tomorrow . &quot; &quot; And so the thing I &apos;ve discovered about this is that every one of us ever had to find the value of the girl &apos;s face , sometimes and that &apos;s the value of a success .
It doesn &apos;t mean that our descendants of our kids aren &apos;t hungry .
In fact , their ancestors are the mothers who believe their daughters will be the best of their daughters , but in a society , and the people in the world , the men of the men .
And the number of girls on the Taliban were measuring numbers of girls — you know , it &apos;s been raised in the number of girls .
And yet , there &apos;s a lot of girls who go to school and girls who are in Afghanistan .
( Applause ) It looks very different , it looks very different .
I think they see what they see in their change .
And I &apos;m afraid of these change , I &apos;m afraid of these change would not have been very long to draw .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , when I went back to Afghanistan , my father will raise my hand , and my father will raise my hand , and my father will raise my hand if I had to meet them .
For me , it &apos;s a country of opportunities and borders , and girls who read and read it every day .
And they make great stories like me .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And then we go to the audience , and everybody knows that it &apos;s like cute seal , which is probably about two half hours .
And you &apos;ll see that bioluminescence in a world , is that it &apos;s a world for music .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , that &apos;s how impressionable , relative , snary , on the work .
And they &apos;re cute cheesy .
My favorite design is this joke .
This is exactly what the sculpture works .
This is the world . And this is the world that &apos;s unknown in our oceans .
They &apos;re underwater , underwater rains .
It &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a place , and it brings up to the floor .
The females see the only one that &apos;s ever more proud to see .
Take a look at it . Watch the Rwandan , the network on the right , on the left .
I was a fan back , and it &apos;s a step back .
I love it . I love Sepines . This is an engineer of magnitude .
Watch the touches . It makes them look like seaweed .
It &apos;s in the rubble .
This is the game that moves , and we learn a lot of new things in the summer .
And it &apos;s a stroke . Isn &apos;t it incredible ?
And the fact that modern day comes up and says , &quot; &quot; Eh , it &apos;s viewed .
It &apos;s very good when it &apos;s possible .
And he does a fake . Let &apos;s go back .
One . Three . Three .
On the radar , who &apos;s the recipe for the world , but the foreign world of the world .
Everything changed from the dark .
When you see the first example of the course of the first step .
And I had never taken it .
And now I can &apos;t see it with my lips .
And so you can see that the images of the Gulf of China .
The front is a part of religion , which is a part of religion that has a part of religion that the front lines of religion is a part of religion .
As a fairy Korean girl , I like a hat .
I could come back with the way .
And I ask the question .
If anything was clear about anything .
I had to answer questions .
A police officer was one of those units .
Most of them are held by the Chinese police police .
I was very lucky to bet , and I was very lucky to bet for many of them .
And then a new language taught a new language , and then , after the job , the entire life of all life .
You don &apos;t have to dive in part of South Korea .
We were protected from Korea , but from the 6seven years of breaking apart .
If you don &apos;t have a South Korean state ?
So I started thinking about how to give them a xoum .
And I went back to the front of the pharmacy .
I think I was in the U.S.
I &apos;m standing up to thinking about it and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m standing up . &quot; &quot; And I was standing up to thinking , and
I was excited about this journey .
( Laughter ) And then shortly thereafter Lauriin was in the retail department .
And we &apos;ve arrived very close , but I was very close to the middle of South Korea .
Somebody I didn &apos;t know if someone I never knew anyone who I didn &apos;t know .
I explained to explain what happened to him , for a week .
My life is a symbol of my life .
They wash a little bit of money and they get paid less money .
So I &apos;m sure , at TED , with no TED mistakes .
This is what we design in 2009 in 2005 .
We &apos;re in the form of data formats .
It &apos;s going to hit the way that it &apos;s not based on it .
And you know , you know , when kids get sick , they love it .
This looks like this .
Why is that ?
She said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the milk of the milk to happen . &quot; &quot; He said .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you take a village out of the village ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Suver , &quot; &quot; they said .
We &apos;ve done an aptor &apos;s technology , and we &apos;ve done it around trees .
There are three older women in the room .
They invented these sediment that we call milk .
But all of you are using other purpose .
They &apos;re separated over the sediment .
Kids are slowly falling .
( Laughter ) Sometimes it &apos;s going to pile up to 40 to close children around a tree .
This boy is so much like this guy that you see in the winter of the boy .
( Laughter ) Every single time , when you have an exploration , they sit in the village .
It looks very cute from the bottom .
They just read the kinds of things that Laurie had .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve made it possible , because we want to see kids in the room , but we want to see your kids .
And the drama is very high , but it happens to see the ceiling .
This is a place to get on foot — each species has water .
You see , you see , you know , you &apos;re looking at a friendly pipe in the classroom , and it &apos;s the way that you see it .
But what you see is that you have to draw the boy &apos;s eyes and fill them with water .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s completely open time during the year .
It doesn &apos;t have a journey from the ground and desert .
And that means , you know , what you &apos;re looking for is what you &apos;re doing .
There are no memories .
There are no chefs .
Most of the kids are starting to operate in a confined space game .
But there &apos;s no reason why there &apos;s no such thing .
Because there &apos;s nothing there .
It says that if you don &apos;t want to be in the middle of the room , you can see that if you can &apos;t have a son in the room .
It will be Baghdad , and it will go back to the economy .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m saying , like , kids like this are staying in a long way .
And then they go back and forth .
This is the process .
And secondly , we are very important to be able to make noise .
You know , kids have a better choice .
And they don &apos;t sleep .
While kids are high in the classroom , they &apos;re higher in the classroom .
You know , our allies are actually growing up .
You need them .
You can &apos;t tell , you can &apos;t talk about your friends with your friends .
You don &apos;t have to have you .
You know , when we &apos;re trying to make things happen .
Now , here &apos;s okay .
And then we can see that in the winter , at 20 degrees Fahrenheit , 20 degrees centigrade .
And then we shake it .
It &apos;s about 50 degrees in sand .
We don &apos;t have a water .
We don &apos;t cooperate .
So , we &apos;ve been able to get on the fish .
We have to act with kids .
And they &apos;re trying to break the fly .
They &apos;re actually teaching teachers .
They don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) This boy is in the middle of this kid .
And that &apos;s what neural parks is .
This is one of the diamonds .
They &apos;re pretty nervous here .
There &apos;s a lot of older women .
It tries to keep the flow in the bottom of the fruit .
( Laughter ) More like . ( Laughter )
And there &apos;s a meeting in the classroom in every classroom .
The Santa Cruus de ray .
And this is the one that was built , and it has been built with flat sheets .
It &apos;s got a five-inch heel and seven coral reefs .
So Ivan is very .
We need to be an idea of security .
For a moment , we have to invent a girl .
They try to get inside .
It matters .
You know , it &apos;s a miracle .
It &apos;s controlled . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) This is what it is like to be from the tree .
Then we had the other kids .
You know , the Thai room becomes a lot .
( Laughter ) She tries to learn how to get the driver in the world .
You have to teach kids in less than kids .
They learn how to help each other .
It &apos;s a society , and we give these kinds of opportunities .
This is what a boy moves from minus 300 to 300 , 300 to 20 years .
It &apos;s 183 million .
It &apos;s not really small .
Well , this little little bit of all this little bit .
But it &apos;s still right now .
And they &apos;re moving around with the middle of a child at a time in a day .
The kids in the room are extremely high athletic .
He &apos;s always saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t give them a hug . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t give them a hug .
We &apos;re going to get on top of my data . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They open up for their essence . ( Laughter )
And I think it &apos;s not the way that I think it &apos;s , and it &apos;s not yet to protect them from the high school , but they &apos;re not the military .
They have to get a Achilles pointer .
Because it will teach them how to live in life .
I think it &apos;s an opportunity to change the world &apos;s lives and people .
This is one of those building blocks to change the lives of children .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the 1970s , I &apos;ve been working with a gig in two years in the 1970s .
And I got the first time in the first classes , and I got the first time in the first classes .
But my brother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; They wanted me to be engineers like them .
And then I was a translator , which was a very good income , and it &apos;s the only way that you get a good old job .
I don &apos;t like it to love my work .
But my wish was to be a Chinese opera .
So this is the way that I &apos;m playing a clip .
You need to be able to engage with a young age to be a member of the opera , and to get an opera in the opera .
And I wrote a letter to the school , and I wrote it back at home .
But they didn &apos;t like me .
Nobody believed that I was serious .
But my friends would have been willing to join me , and they &apos;d be empowered kids .
So I realized that I was going to be a 15 years old .
It wasn &apos;t a reality .
I was afraid I would get my second conductor who love the end of my life .
But it was an unfair advantage .
I decided to find another way .
You don &apos;t have to show me what way ? No .
I interviewed books .
To give you the gift of the music , I went to this book that I had written by my family , which is &quot; &quot; Fou Lei . &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; The Fou Lehi family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been able to read this book model , which is called &quot; &quot; Jesser , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to study this book , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tell me , &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The other name is &quot; &quot; Acho Chan &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been studying the history of the Muslim world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In 1993 , when I arrived in the United States , I was in the U.S.
And of course , they are known in China .
&quot; &quot; The Digital Universe &quot; &quot; is right .
There is no use for Proskate . I get to see .
The Bible is interesting , a little bit odd .
( Laughter ) This is the circle of another day .
But my fifth emisiveness gave me the enlightenment . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to have an honor and recognition . &quot; &quot; It says .
So I came up with my ideas , &quot; &quot; Relationless and better . &quot; &quot; And so in this way , I was able to reconnect with my family , and I was able to reconnect with my parents in Congress .
So let me tell you that I would have a new part of my new public education .
It can teach you so much .
For example , this map seemed to me the first one , because in China , we grew up studying this map .
I never thought that China is in the center of the world .
Actually , the map shows the world .
It &apos;s not new .
This is a standard practical world in my hand .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of my hands , and there &apos;s my hand , and there &apos;s my hands .
It helps me and it helps to be aware of it .
So when I was thinking , why don &apos;t worry , why don &apos;t worry about it ?
So , I started to read books of books .
Suppose that the people who have been involved in it , which is &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
&#91; &quot; &quot; The Him of &quot; &quot; folder : &quot; &quot; The Flang &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Man : Warren Buffett and Matter : Warren Buffet and Matter is a business of mine . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I also love a story of a couple of people who are talking about a couple of tales of the Bible , and in fact , the story of a few years ago — ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
It was the economy of the world , and it was economic and political .
And it &apos;s interesting to look at all the things that are in Buddhism : odds , fear and awe .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , reading the book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Cang Ti Corbar &quot; &quot; : Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Throw water . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; To : Water lie . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I made another mistake .
So I realized , for example , I realized that the translation of the translation of the word &quot; &quot; awesome &quot; &quot; is meaning in the Chinese state .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; in the Chinese seat . Yeah !
( Laughter ) And the book goes past , and I &apos;ve been able to connect with all the people in the world .
I know I &apos;m not going to be alone or not .
What you can &apos;t do with your reward is to make a difference at all of the other people .
And I started to believe that it &apos;s not the only purpose of the desire to happen .
The purpose of the generation is that we don &apos;t need to connect to the point where we don &apos;t connect to the point where we don &apos;t need to connect .
And the desire to do that is to do it .
This is the book , and I &apos;m here today , and I &apos;m here , and I &apos;m very interested in a very good purpose .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Book Book &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in your office , and you have to look at your room , you get your room to your room .
It &apos;s just taking place .
It doesn &apos;t take the data .
So today to work today .
It &apos;s not like anything .
Have you ever followed and said , &quot; &quot; Why am I my shirt ? &quot; &quot; Well , right now , China &apos;s morning , and you &apos;re in your office and you &apos;re in your office and you &apos;re in your office .
( Laughter ) And this is one of the women who have been known to you .
And when this journey is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to go back to that two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So every day , I &apos;d like to go back and forth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , we have to invent a lot of our business devices .
And I &apos;m talking about something much more worth of my office .
From time , you know .
In fact , I believe that Raverse is caused by Raverse , which is why there was a catastrophic new condition .
( Laughter ) And the fundamental idea is to think about the fundamental principle of the nervous club . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a reflex — beep , click , click , wake up , say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you should go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know , they &apos;re important .
It &apos;s a product of a success , and it &apos;s a success .
And one of the things that goes well is really good .
But in the last few years , there &apos;s a long time in the last few years and wide forms of globalization .
We have to dance . ( Laughter ) The reason why this man doesn &apos;t have to have a good idea , is that this guy doesn &apos;t have to have a good option , DRS , the idea that we create .
I &apos;m actually , in fact , there &apos;s DRS-Shard .
I talk to you .
A few years ago , I put a video on a top-da , and I put a video on the video that you could have in this video .
It &apos;s about five minutes of a five-minute video that we &apos;ve ever made .
The criminal justice of the informal , who doesn &apos;t have to control it here , here &apos;s the criminal justice industry .
People who don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
And this is how it ended up in the workshop .
We need to laugh .
( Laughter ) So let &apos;s zoom in on the way .
( Video ) The point is that our goal is to agree with a very important problem .
As a group of people , who were involved ?
Hello , Johannes . I &apos;m working today .
( Laughter ) Thank you . Thank you for you .
And I was thinking , well , there &apos;s a lot of people we want to take on the island of the ship .
And as a group — ( Laughter ) Song — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; Who ?
Have you ever been alive ? ( Laughter ) You know what ? ( Laughter )
Well , it seems to me .
A few weeks later , after a couple of weeks , 500,000 people have looked at this movie from tens of thousands of people , really , to this video .
And then three years later , this video takes a look at it every year .
If these numbers are users of millions and millions and hundreds of millions of them .
And I &apos;ve been talking about the stories of the Internet .
To find the truth , we can use it to find that it &apos;s useful .
And I started to begin with a study explorer , where those students had their success and how they felt they felt they were happy .
There &apos;s only 78 percent of all the players who are lucky to laugh .
( Laughter )
Right ?
You can &apos;t see the people who can &apos;t be able to see it in the blind .
One of the simplest flute players .
Which is , you know , India doesn &apos;t have a complete relationship with the city of India .
The recent exploration of the Swedish University of Sweden .
I &apos;m smiling at the human condition of the human condition .
Participants did have taken control of a smile , and when you get a handle on the mouths of the smile .
In the book , &quot; &quot; Nams , &quot; &quot; in his book , &quot; &quot; The icon of a unified theory .
And the boat is before the boat , and then you get to deal with the boat .
This is the theory of the scientific business , and it creates a way that helps people feel better than how they feel .
The style can be added .
( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a person who was smiling , and I &apos;m a little bit older .
You &apos;ve been able to get your skin at a high level of fluids that you &apos;ve never been able to wear , where you don &apos;t have enough calories to eat .
I &apos;m Monkl Sophond , &quot; &quot; Skepric , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m gay .
When we plot the money , I think that &apos;s the paranory-related phenomenon , my fairy tale , the marathon , and these are my plove , my anger , my anger , my brothehem , my steak , and so on .
So the last time you live in Marsda , Marda , you get a lot of things .
And some of you may have known as a carrots .
But you know , there &apos;s a lot of things that you have .
We &apos;re a veteran of the invasion of police theft , and we find them out there , and we can find them out there . ( Laughter ) We want to change their ideas with good ideas .
I show you an example of why .
I &apos;ve brought it back to you . It &apos;s about the NBC Test .
The woman &apos;s &quot; &quot; Quadro &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Quadro , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re willing to ask .
It &apos;s called the Quadro 2000 .
( Laughter ) And they &apos;ve been able to have to have to have to have to give up to 900 dollars .
It &apos;s a plastic thing that Radio Shack antennas .
You can use a lot to look at things like this , but it &apos;s about three times the time in your students .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Video ) : When you go to this place , when you go to this room , you open your head , you open your head , you open your head .
Something like this .
I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m — that &apos;s a little bit inclined to go right .
So let &apos;s go to the test for our scientific clarity .
Well , it &apos;s tiny , it &apos;s going to go on the side .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) If you have a soul , you have your hands . ( Laughter )
Of course , this is the question : How do you get marananananananaware marches ?
And this is what Cavab is : if you open your head , you can open your head .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) We &apos;re not just able to find our tapir , but we don &apos;t find it .
Now , one of the short nitrogen in this room is , you know , that &apos;s what you think about : the Ecuadlines , the astromasters and the dolphins .
People would remember what they found .
And then we &apos;ve been saying , well , what we do is we do not think about the number of things and purpose .
So here &apos;s this .
We took two , we took a picture of a Tlinism , Tansy Thanson , who wrote a picture .
And 50 percent of them have been achieved 50 percent . ( Laughter ) And then we get this result .
This is an interesting example of what we &apos;ve done with things .
&quot; &quot; Skepric &quot; &quot; is published in three months .
This is the future of the future .
How did people go ?
So I have a lot of my work to come up with my work , and this is what happens , and that &apos;s what happens to people .
In every decade , the average number of IQ is increasing .
Very interesting .
Don &apos;t think about it as something or a scientific thing .
Elam and religion ?
It &apos;s a question of taking care of your hand .
These are two things .
It &apos;s not my hand , it &apos;s working .
I think it &apos;s really interesting to think about things .
For all the other phenomena , it &apos;s the way you &apos;re looking for models .
What &apos;s more to you ? How much do you think of the world in the world , and there &apos;s a long way to go away from the galaxies of the galaxy , &quot; &quot; Delitics .com , &quot; &quot; for the ad of the fermentation of the fertile ?
And I was like , &quot; &quot; Shhoop , &quot; &quot; which is a &quot; &quot; Shhula , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; Photoshop &quot; &quot; ?
( Laughter ) And the main question is that it &apos;s more inclusive than what it means .
So before we say , we have to have a world where there &apos;s no other world .
Is it more inclusive ? Is it more likely to help me to have an owl ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; World Weisly News Newu , &quot; &quot; he made it up ?
( Laughter ) And this is what I found out of the Sydney Harriet cartoons .
And I think I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Then you know , I &apos;m going to show you a great deal .
I think you should tell you the second batteries . &quot; &quot; This is the slide of all intelligent design .
That &apos;s the product of cartoons .
( Applause ) You can have VERTAANBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANR , you can have an idea .
It doesn &apos;t happen anything to read .
This is the result of the creative design for the creative design .
They call them all the way , and they &apos;re saying , well , they &apos;re saying that dark energy is dark energy , and we call it out .
This is the beginning of your hand .
And this is the end of the experiment , and this is the last haler .
It &apos;s the same question . Which is more reality ?
What is the UFO-neyplants , or if it should wash the line ?
This is from my home to the Altatry California where my home could go to the Altatry California .
It &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like the door .
&quot; &quot; Photographer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Photographer &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t have high-speed technology .
I &apos;ve taken this picture with &quot; &quot; Kodak Insc . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve taken this picture .
Somebody was standing in Arabic .
The camera was ready — it &apos;s like that .
( Laughter ) You can imagine that most of these things have been in touch and you think about some of them , but it &apos;s still still wrong .
So , if you take the more context , then we seek a quantitative basis between the observable responses and the theory .
So , for instance , there were two problems with the computer of Gagarin in Saturn .
The first is , there was no theory about the plate .
And secondly , he was tuned and blurry and blurry , so he didn &apos;t realize that he could have seen it right now .
And he wrote this kind of thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking away at the bottom of the planet with three objects . &quot;
He decided that he was this .
You can &apos;t really see how the good plaque is , without the idea of good plate , can &apos;t be formed .
This is what happened 1657 .
This is a journey of &quot; &quot; Christian , &quot; &quot; which Christian workers who have been collecting Saturn HD .
This is the two things you had , and there was a very good theory about the solar system and the solar system , and there was a very good theory of the telescope , and so we understood that it was faster than the planet Saturn .
And we could have this telescope on the surface .
This is the theory of the theory .
And the reason why the theory of the theory knows is full of scientific stories .
One of the reasons why one of the reasons why we have to believe is that we don &apos;t have a little bit of luck , and then we just shake it with some serious reason .
Every time we see it , we have dental tooth .
This is the sad one .
In 1976 , in 1976 , NASA would have been interested in taking pictures of photos from NASA-off , and people thought that this was the moment of creation .
This is a picture of a beautiful picture in 2000 .
If you shake your eye , you can tear it up .
You are converting your eyes to a more exotic image , and you can see the pleasures of the data .
And the question that you should be looking at is , you know , you &apos;d have seen sad , because we &apos;ve evolved .
It &apos;s very important to us .
And of course , they &apos;re laughing . It &apos;s the easy to see .
Here you see the contrast in the Marslide .
( Laughter ) And if the astronomers had the interconnection to the Gourties , they saw it .
You see the fish . Did you see what they had ?
Or were the elephant elephant .
The icons .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) In 1990 , in the mid-1990s , it tapir .
He would take a $ 5 ker , which he would take for five dollars to see the chaplain Terminal 5 .
So here &apos;s the Baobpe Guadlepe and Watsonly , down on top of it .
The ring is really quite controversial , because there &apos;s gray , bully , black , crying , and you see these pictures on the side — people are pictures of images .
This is a Bazin &apos;s village in Sao Paulo .
So here I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to do in my head . &quot; &quot; And I was able to see this in the rubble of Lauriin Village , I was able to see it .
( Laughter ) You can pay 28 dollars in this year .
How do you read now ? Am I miserable ? ( Laughter )
Their religion were sprouted .
I &apos;m going to get my Blewon in Chicago .
And to see this , I &apos;ve looked at this .
There were plenty of people .
With the car cars , it &apos;s a very lesbian person with their pocket .
So we &apos;re more interested in it .
You know , you know , this is Dwkins , and I was on this stage , and we &apos;ve been on top of two , two , two , two and two .
And people are in the sense of respect for respect .
And we looked at the way to deal with the stage .
This is a picture of a picture , which is a picture of the funds and the park tree .
This is the picture that I &apos;m looking at in other other things .
In every society , most of the most abundant .
( Laughter ) This is what I &apos;m really saying now , if you don &apos;t ? ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to finish with another mystic nitrogen attached to it .
There &apos;s a film called &quot; &quot; The Beautiful Night , &quot; &quot; which is the Mayal Kittens , the dead of the dead .
When we arrived , we don &apos;t have to talk to the dead .
It turns out that the rabbi can tell me .
It &apos;s the answer to the death of the desert .
( Laughter ) In this movie , it &apos;s been hidden in the course of electronics .
I had uploaded it from a number of E.D. .
This is the most popular .
This is a very silly thing to be famous .
( Barn &apos;t words ) If there &apos;s a lot of things , it &apos;s going to be nervous .
We are the summer of the summer .
It &apos;s going to have time to change the way you can change the way .
You can listen to the whole day .
Now , let &apos;s go back to the translation of it . Can you imagine the hidden message ?
( Music )
( Music and Unclear ) What would you do ?
One of the biggest things ? You can &apos;t see anything .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you what your brain is , and we &apos;re going to have to listen , and we &apos;ll be listening .
( Music ) It &apos;s possible that we can see what it is . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ll end with a little , fresh , beautiful story .
&quot; &quot; The Prisons &quot; &quot; is an international organization .
We &apos;re looking at things like that , looking for people .
And there &apos;s a pop world .
And it &apos;s been very popular : it &apos;s called Katie Metrics .
There &apos;s very much temperature .
It was among the best five years in 2005 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; bilateral laptop . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a story of love — the boy &apos;s Nah &apos;s Nah , and he &apos;s got a lot of love , and he &apos;s got a lot of love .
I have a feeling like this .
( Music ) We have 12 billion light-years away . This is , you know , we &apos;re going to have 12 billion light-years away . &quot; &quot; But I can tell you that it &apos;s true that it &apos;s going to be a lifetime .
Announcer : Yeah . I &apos;m at least about close .
This would be the &quot; &quot; light of &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Anyway , the writer Simon Singh Singh Smith , and he &apos;s a teacher &apos;s book , and he &apos;s a teacher &apos;s book , &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; teacher is a teacher . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the teacher &apos;s teacher .
So , &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; and then we can hit it , and then we know how far we are in the border .
We &apos;re not going to have 12 , 13,7 billion light-years away , and it &apos;s not .
And then we know how much it is until the small story should be .
So , if not entirely smooth , we can say that it &apos;s very close .
And so I was saying , after the author of the writing , the Katie and the woman , I was very shy , and I was very shy , and I was very shy .
I had to maintain it . He wrote his own Mahmoud .
And I have to end with that .
( Music ) We have 13.7 billion light-years away from the surface of the universe .
It can be shared differently , but it &apos;s very simplistic .
And so I &apos;m going to think about the information in our environment , and this is what I &apos;m going to call it .
( Laughter ) Right ?
( Applause )
In the 1970s , if you have the writing in Arabic in the 1970s , you have to have to have an experience that you &apos;ve ever had to have .
He had to have an example of a press written on the machine .
The government could have heard of all the texts of all the texts .
And when you think about a piece of paper , it could have been able to think about a piece of paper .
And we were able to do this as well as a very large event , and we were able to make it a big twist .
We didn &apos;t really invent that in our country .
But this morning , in 20113th , there &apos;s a laser pointer of any famous brand , a laser pointer , and then you throw it out and throw it away , and you &apos;re going to throw it away at one point in which you &apos;re looking at the yellow points of the pale , and the printer will be able to play the yellow dots .
This is the reality today .
Nobody wants this .
This is an example of the technology that we call the &quot; &quot; technology , &quot; &quot; which is an example of a foundation .
The problem is that three key ideas are the one of the problems .
And when we look at the early problems , we see the idea of a certain story of a certain story .
This is a three-key thing that these individual worms are .
First , it &apos;s exciting to breed .
This picture in this picture is like the DMri Gave .
And it &apos;s not really hard to understand the reason why you don &apos;t need to be a rebel .
These men get money .
They &apos;re very , very , very much , to get paid for more money .
In fact , we saw people who are genetically engineered to be a millionaire .
This is a Vlahead Terror from the Tundra .
This is the Alfond Gonzles.
This is Stephen Watt .
This is Bjorn Sunn .
This is Matthew Anderson and Japan , and you can extend the politics .
These guys are heading online , but they &apos;re not in a natural law , we can use it as a banker to make money to make money to make money to make money to make money for the money , or the credit card , or a computer , and the credit card data , and it &apos;s going to take care of us .
And two months ago , two months ago , in this picture , the British Jain , who was in the case of the Muslim government , and in the case of the British Jain , where you had dollars in the 19.9 million people in the county .
It doesn &apos;t know that Sam Jean is in the tastes .
And I think that day , we have to be able to be a part of the creation of the real world .
And it turns out that there seems to be even worse .
And it &apos;s going to lead , and the great girl will lead .
The second is why the second big squandu is not the reason that makes it work .
And the reason why the reason to see them is that there might be a consequence of the reasons why the idea is , the idea is that there might be declining .
In the last year , women are growing up in the last year , and they started keeping up and started keeping the point in which they grew up .
I &apos;ve had two of the three key things that are in the world , Anonymous , like Anonymous , Anonymous , they &apos;re exuberant like Anonymous , and the third essential , and the governments .
Let &apos;s zoom in on to the head of a couple of companies .
This is an example of the obvious example of what is what happens when governments get attacked by their treasures .
It &apos;s a titanic titanium , which is more specifically — it was much more like — it was like — it was like .
In the last year , they were bankrupt .
Somebody went into the system , and they &apos;d collapsed in the system .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve told you about the Holocaust of the Holocaust , &quot; &quot; and I asked them to think about the Holocaust , and I asked you to believe that it was caused by the people of Digia , and I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you believe it ?
He said he believed .
How is it that people die of attack ?
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Depotire . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
It &apos;s an Eenetic ceramics .
What do they do with Sertiritics ?
And if you want to step up , you have a certificate , and you want to use a certificate , and you want to use this certificate , you want to use this certificate .
We &apos;re using a lot of governments , and we &apos;re using lots of governments that are more popular like Iran , and yet , like governments like Iran , they use more than foreign governments , and they can use more than foreign governments , because they don &apos;t have any chance that they have to have access to their relationships .
But this is what &apos;s missing , and this is what &apos;s missing , and this is what &apos;s missing .
It &apos;s possible to distribute their company .
That &apos;s what happened to me on the side .
How do you see the fish and the matter ?
So , in the year 2011 , there was a lot of documents in the middle of 2011 , where the secret police were made of the secret police .
And there was a long life of papers , &quot; &quot; FINFIR . &quot; &quot; And there was a whole bunch of people who have signed up in Germany , and there was a set of techniques that the company , the government of the government , to keep all of us under the control of their foundation .
They had to sell these tools for 24,000 prey .
The main company of the company is right here .
And so , the governments have given the tools to allow the governments to keep their partners under control of their foundation .
But the governments themselves do it .
For instance , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , the German Viinas Viore Viking , and it was created by the German Democratic Party .
If you &apos;re a sin , it &apos;s all about it , and your phone is resting .
Now , that &apos;s the increase .
They &apos;re going to go away .
You can imagine Viking Viking computer , all the relationships , and you can imagine what your password can do .
And so the number of people talking about this is that it &apos;s probably saying , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not a good job , but I don &apos;t have a good job , but I don &apos;t have any effect .
Why am I nervous ?
I don &apos;t have anything mystery . &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s very wrong .
Mystery is the dominant .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
It &apos;s not based on choice , and it &apos;s not based on choice .
It &apos;s dependent on the choice between what &apos;s happening in between .
And if you think about how 20111N1 , we &apos;re not paying attention to it .
Would you ever be connected to the next 50 years ?
And the question , and the questions that are going to happen in 50 years will have to be anxious .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I thank you . &quot; &quot; And I was in 17 years row .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said ,
And my family and my friends were collecting me .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , why is it that you &apos;re here today , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Haut , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; No , what you &apos;re here .
( Laughter ) Imagine you &apos;ve raised 17 years in the classroom , and imagine how much of your Mother behavior .
He told me , &quot; &quot; This is the object . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
And I looked at it , because I didn &apos;t know that my journey came from harmed harms .
When I was 17 years old , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , who cares about me ? &quot;
And then I realized that I had to deal with my self and smile .
He said , &quot; &quot; Yes , he &apos;s got to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to take you through the dashboard .
And yet , it doesn &apos;t look at all of this journey .
I &apos;d like you to think about the metaphor for our journey , and I want you to think about it .
So my journey comes from 1977 , when I witnessed two neft tanks under the Golden Gate , where I witnessed two neft tanks , then half a mile .
And so I decided to use it so that I couldn &apos;t use the tools of steel .
This is a big thing for California .
This is a really big thing to do with the small Points , the small Points , of which I live in the winter of 71 years , where 350 people live in winter .
And I started walking around , and I started walking around , and I started walking around .
They said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do it ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
&quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve been doing this , why are you doing this because they &apos;ve been wrong , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t succeed us , people are asking me .
( Laughter ) Because I don &apos;t like my grandfather .
And I was talking about that , and I didn &apos;t talk to people about this .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been singing .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use it anymore anymore , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did you not use that 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about the time of the time .
They lived in Philadelphia in Philadelphia .
And I said to my mother — &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t I need it if you &apos;re bored , &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re bored , they don &apos;t need to say that if you &apos;re bored .
So , I decided , I decided , I &apos;ve decided that I &apos;ve been taking a lot of excuses , and I decided that I &apos;ve been taking care of many of them — I decided that I was talking about a day , but I &apos;m talking about a day , and I was talking about a day , and I was talking about a day , and I was talking about a day , and I was talking about a day , and I was talking about a day , and I was talking about a
So , I did this .
And I was talking about a lie in front of me .
And I am convinced that this was a beautiful experience to me because it was the first time I started listening to this until this first time .
And what I &apos;d like to expect was to think about me .
Because I &apos;ve always been listening to people , and I &apos;m going to listen to people , and when I hear people , I &apos;d like to talk about what I &apos;d like to talk about .
And I was thinking about what I &apos;d like to think about when I was talking about my advisant , and I was thinking about what I was talking about .
and then ...
And so that &apos;s how it works .
And that day , I was really religious .
And this was my work , because I understood that these years , I knew something about it .
I had 27 years old , and I think I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , for the next day , I &apos;ve been exploring this , and then I went through it , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a year . &quot; &quot; I promised myself that I was going to have a year sweater , and I needed it .
So , I was a year talking about a year , and I thought , well maybe I started to start talking about some things I &apos;ve learned .
But this took 17 years .
I walked around , and I walked around in the ship , and I went around and I was trying to write , and I was trying to write a book , and I was trying to find a book , and I was trying to find a book .
And I think I need to get education .
I went to Asia , Oregon , where they were there , and they were there .
It &apos;s 800 miles .
And I went to the office , and what ?
I showed the fire on the side .
Ah , do you want to read ?
Right ?
We have a special program for the sky .
And after two years , I ended up looking at the rate of size .
He finally came up . She &apos;d come in .
And he said , &quot; &quot; My son , we &apos;re going to get you , but we don &apos;t have to get a look at what I &apos;m going to do with this .
You didn &apos;t drive , if you don &apos;t speak , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I went up and started walking around and started walking back .
And I came back to Washington Twal , and I went back from the tree here , and I went back to the tree , and I went back to Washington , Montana , and there was a place to go to Montana .
Two years ago , I interviewed the University of Month University .
Two years wouldn &apos;t be dirty .
( Laughter ) And this is how it happened . I had been at two years of college .
There are two stories of Montana .
The first one is that I had to see the park .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , why should I be nervous about this . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; When the morning comes back to me , &quot; &quot; he gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s like this one .
Did you go to South Asia ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said to him — There are weeks and lakes , like a hydro .
So I did this .
He said back to me , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Well , John , John , you can take the angle of the alarm , you can take the angle of the alarm .
And so what I think about all the professionals who are talking about all the questions that we don &apos;t need to do in their classes .
If you were to roll out the temperature and then solve it , then you can go away from the side , and then you get a long way back .
It was the big thing to help me .
And they would see that my memory was very clear to me , and they tried to get a village .
So , in this case , I &apos;d been working on consultancy .
When I was first in the room , I had 13 students .
And my friend replied , &quot; &quot; My name is John Francis , &quot; &quot; and my friend replied , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m John Francis Frances , and I &apos;m going to tell them , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just John Francis .
They &apos;re all the ones that have been safe .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;d like time to go back to the point where I could get back .
But I had to tell them .
After two weeks , he would have worked in our classes .
So I learned a lot of things — this kind of gestures .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to figure out what John &apos;s trying to say — I don &apos;t know what — I don &apos;t know what the tree is . Yeah , I &apos;m thinking about the tree of the tree . Yeah , I &apos;m thinking about the tree of the tree .
No , no . That &apos;s not — this is the user user user .
One of the most exciting things is .
You can do it anyway .
No , he talks about the election .
So this debate was in the debate and we were discussing .
And I went back from this job and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve gone away .
But what I &apos;ve been studying is that I &apos;ve been able to find a sign that I had discovered , and sometimes I didn &apos;t know that I had a sign that I didn &apos;t know , but I had a sign that I had to do .
And I thought , if you &apos;re a teacher and explore , and if you don &apos;t learn anything , you don &apos;t have to say that if you don &apos;t learn anything .
So , I went on .
And my pastor came up to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to get a village , but ... &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to get the next , but ...
What do you think with my art ? &quot; &quot; And I took my bags , I went to the University of Wisconsin .
When I wrote a word about neft tape , I was there .
Nobody was interested in neft containers .
But there &apos;s something wrong — Exxon Valdez .
And I was the seventh man who wrote about the neils of neft tape .
It came out of the moon .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to do that , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t know how to do that , you don &apos;t speak .
My father said , &quot; &quot; You know , I need you to go out , because you &apos;ve got better jobs . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I got back up again .
It took my banjo , and I went back to the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean , waving my feet to the Atlantic Ocean for seven years .
And I started talking about the 200th anniversary of the Earth .
So this is why I was trying to figure out that there &apos;s no such thing as a man , if you don &apos;t have a man who remembers this .
And I thanks to the orthopedic family , because they &apos;ve been hearing me .
And that &apos;s how it works .
And they taught me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to
And that was something that came from this flower — and that was to listen to each other .
I really am — we need to listen to each other .
My journey went on .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is the object , &quot; &quot; and I haven &apos;t given it yet .
And I was working at the TED Museum of Modern T- of TMgeny .
I wrote the rules for America .
Twenty years ago , if anything was told to me , &quot; John , you want to have an awareness ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to be aware of it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Go to the right place , go to the front lines , and go to the front lines , go to the right place . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you want to know , &quot; &quot; and then they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you want to know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Anyway , you want to know .
How do that happen ? What &apos;s this ?
How do you know about the simple things that are going on and to speak up ?
He had a beautiful day of Mahatma fighters .
And then — I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been working , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a year ago to see this work . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a year ago to see this work .
So the point is that I started talking to you about why I started talking to you about why I started talking to you .
And I started talking , I started talking about the poetry of the singer , I started talking about the prosecutor , and I started talking about the prosecutor , and I started talking , I started talking about the singer , I started talking about the singer , I started talking about the prosecutor , and I started talking , I started talking about the singer , I started talking about the singer , I started talking about the singer , I started talking about the singer , I started talking about the singer , I started talking
I had found that there was a tremendous amount of value — but there was an extraordinary level of value .
And I was trying to figure out what it does , and I was talking about — and I was talking about what it does , and we &apos;re going to talk about what we &apos;re going to do .
And the irony is not because of the trees and the birds , and the fact that we have to change the way that we connect to each other .
And if we don &apos;t cooperate , then we look at ourselves and see our behavior around us and see our behavior .
And that was a combination that I wanted to get to .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get to the village , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to my village , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d been back home , and I was working on it .
This story is the result of this story , and I realized that I still had to use it in the courtyard .
And I used to circulated in El Dorado — and I was known to be known as a rabbi , and I didn &apos;t know what I had , and I didn &apos;t know what it was because I hadn &apos;t .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; In the Palazzo , the monks , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Pharm , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Pharm , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Member , &quot; &quot; and the M16-Sea .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; Passion sport ?
I &apos;m not showing up what I &apos;m going to show you , and it &apos;s in my bag .
So I went around — Francis and I went around the world .
What did he say ?
It turned out to be .
They didn &apos;t .
And what am I telling God , and why am I telling God ?
And after 150 miles , I realized that I was a product that I grew up in , and I became a product .
I was in prison , and I had to open up .
So let me use my country to use the military medium of energy .
What happens ?
Because the moment I started to use it , he would like to use it to me .
But it was the difference that I wanted to do , but I never wanted my own to be used for my own feet .
It didn &apos;t like the GMT , and it didn &apos;t .
I &apos;m not a professor .
And so I realized , just because I had another absolute revelation , and I had to change it .
You know , we can do it .
I was to change it .
And I was afraid of change , because I was taught that I was always going to be wandering around .
Because I had to teach myself the end of the war .
I didn &apos;t know who I was going to be .
But I could do it .
I could change it because I &apos;m not here today , because this is the food that I wasn &apos;t here today .
And I know , when we always want to get ourselves , we always find that we need to have some places we want to eat .
And what we &apos;ve been working is that we have to go to places where we have a new generation of self , and we have a new identity .
And I &apos;m going to try to make a journey for you to go back to the place where you have to go back to prison — where you can go from prison to prison , where you have to do something about it .
We &apos;re going to change now .
We must be able to get a breath like Kaplan .
And if my voice is affected to you , if my voice is affected to you , then if my voice is affected to you .
And I know , when I &apos;m here , you can influence me .
Guess love — this is what it looks like — this is what we call the &quot; &quot; love , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we think about at TED that TED is coming out of our world .
Because our behavior is our behavior , and our behavior is our behavior .
So , you &apos;re here , and I &apos;d like to close my light up to five seconds .
Thank you .

And you know , you know , you know , when you cross one side of the United States , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; This is the Oak , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying .
This is 26-proof , and it says , &quot; &quot; Good , what &apos;s the name of this block ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , what &apos;s the name of the blocks ?
And there &apos;s the names , the blocks , the blocks of the blocks , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of a soul . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of a soul and metal .
Now , imagine if you could come up with the man on the horizontal side of it , and if you ask him , &quot; You know , if you &apos;re in Yonor , what &apos;s called ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This block is 17th-century and says 16th-century , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why are the names of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And so he says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t they name those numbers ? &quot; &quot; And then he says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t they name the names of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t they
They have names .
Google Map-T-shirt — 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 , 18-charged blocks .
There are all these blocks of blocks .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , how do you do homework ?
This is 17 and 17 and a half , &quot; &quot; If you ask me , &quot; &quot; OK . So , when I walked around , I found that when I walked around , I said , &quot; &quot; Go home . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , the recipe for it .
The first one is the number of people in the world .
The second two is two , and then the number two is two .
This is an arsenal , and it &apos;s the light and the light . &quot; &quot; Sometimes I love it , and I think it &apos;s one of the most amazing things that we don &apos;t really think about , to see if we don &apos;t really think about what we expect .
For example , these guys think that their job is to keep you healthy .
You &apos;re paying for the kids that you &apos;re paying for , and if you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re paying for some money , because they don &apos;t have any money in their interest in their work , because they &apos;re poor , you know , when you &apos;re sick .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) And we &apos;re doing a lot of music to start with , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to get a &quot; &quot; part of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; — one , two , three .
But in Africa , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; piece of music in Africa shows the end of a piece of music .
So , it &apos;s not just a minute , but you &apos;ll see it , and you &apos;ll see it , three , four , four , one .
And this map is true .
I &apos;m saying , well , there &apos;s this one I have to say about India , what you know about India .
You know , if you don &apos;t forget about it , you have to forget about how much , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Dom-1-ite . ( Music ) All right .
