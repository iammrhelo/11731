So I &apos;m going to talk today about invisible exploration of the invisible discovery .
So I &apos;m working on the planet Earth .
And my little bit of light is to jump inside our own , and then ...
And let &apos;s look at different mirrors .
This is just a little video about what we &apos;re doing .
One is a Japanese .
It can be a little bit of the pressure .
( Laughter ) We just — this part of the piece — I &apos;m just going to cut it off the piece of the piece of the piece . ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) (
( Music ) That &apos;s not . ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The magic technology .
Oh , what was time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
I &apos;d like to urge you to see what you &apos;re just watching .
So , after a few minutes , let &apos;s go back to this . I hope that if you can &apos;t have a very high probability of it , it &apos;s very important to change your life .
We &apos;re very interested in language , particularly in particular , and it &apos;s just taking our language to our language .
The different lines of different different lines are more interested in the things : ( Laughter ) — and I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m looking at the unfuradeur and a smile , and a little bit like a matter of playing , or something like a matter of playing .
Narrator : They &apos;re coming up with 10 numbers of home .
This is the lucky police act in America .
And then the head is miserable — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to get rid of our essence .
We &apos;re inside .
We &apos;re invisible to the guy in the world .
As you see , there &apos;s animals and people are the same .
It turns out that there &apos;s no power and strength in this .
And then we &apos;re just saying that we are very often at the moment of the people that we &apos;re very much in .
So if you &apos;re in a sense of identity , we &apos;re trying to pile up , we &apos;re trying to pile up , we &apos;re trying to pile up . We don &apos;t have to pile up .
In contrast , we are the glue .
Can you know what it &apos;s like ?
And I found that the Great Wall of cluster gestures in cluster munitions are also dominated by nuclei .
They &apos;re apathy , they &apos;re talking about the fact that they &apos;re going to be in the classroom , when they &apos;re in the middle of the flies , and they &apos;re still in the middle of the dark , and they &apos;re still like the ones that start their appearance .
They &apos;re sitting in the middle of a little bit of the 200th .
They &apos;re just out of that .
They &apos;re invisible .
They &apos;re angry like they &apos;re sitting in it , and they &apos;re just like that .
I went up to a couple of answers to my own self .
The first is to be able to be challenged .
Heather is , it &apos;s very dependent on sexual .
So the women are more likely to be the law of that is that women are competing .
The girls are less likely to feel less than men and boys .
And it &apos;s also a place where there &apos;s no good deal .
And it &apos;s very important to the MBA , because they are the press and the press and the press .
We have to recognize that our schools are often rare , and they &apos;re always looking at the violence .
The one that &apos;s in the wake of the person who is ready and the women are coming in , and then they &apos;re looking at different governments at the end of the day .
I started thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve started thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more active , and you can get a little more active , more cuttable than you see , and that &apos;s more active , and I started thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve started to think of myself as a more active , but to be more active , more mentally , more active in the way .
Would you show these videos if you want them to take them on the basis of their own ?
And it was a very common thing to do , and it wouldn &apos;t be a real thing .
So we can change our very quickly , and we can feel more powerful within our behavior , that we can feel more powerful than the outcome of the behavior ?
We know that our jg and our fairy tales are just thinking about us and their peers , and they have a lot of pain .
But the question that scientists are trying to make us is that we are able to do ourselves and not have to do it .
But we &apos;re also in the classroom , and we &apos;re going to shake it in the classroom , and we &apos;re going to smile .
And that &apos;s all the things that are going on .
It &apos;s also also part of the power of power .
We are very powerful , and we &apos;re able to see ourselves as powerful as gestures and gestures , but we &apos;re really excited about our essence , we feel hopeful .
It &apos;s not changing our brains , but it &apos;s not changing our behavior , but it &apos;s not changing our brains .
And I think of power , and I think , from the point of power , what &apos;s wrong ?
I &apos;m talking about the physics and the things that are the things that are forms of the physics , and the way that I think is the kind of thing that &apos;s about the physics , and I study these hormones .
What &apos;s the question that we see are the ones that are more likely to think about ?
It &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not just a lot of people who are suffering .
We call them both &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; and you know .
And we &apos;re making a new model of simplicity .
They selected the gambling game , which is the game game .
But the ones who are in the oasis of power , but 60 percent of it . It &apos;s very important .
And this is what you &apos;re doing in the test .
In the test of the energy , 20 percent increase in the test of the energy of the Gyums , and in the test , is 10 percent .
It becomes a verb to both of the things that are happening to both of the matter .
And they &apos;re in a crime .
In the extreme crime of the sexual is in the area of the sexual , and the number 15 percent of the people in the darkness are there .
The two are not the two , and the more ambitious , the more it &apos;s , it does not have to feel the more ambitious , uneasy , uneasy , uncomforting , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfortably , uncomfor
And so that &apos;s what we &apos;re all meeting with , right ?
And there &apos;s no way to think about how we think about ourselves and how we feel about how we feel , and not just for other things .
And it &apos;s changing our way to think about it .
And the very strange question that makes us interesting is that we can get a few minutes of a moment of freedom that we can make to change our life .
This is a arthritis that has been held in the maze .
Do you get to the bottom of that ?
It &apos;s , of course , that &apos;s what makes us interesting .
And the reason we are , in our turn , is that the military is used to be used to be in the media .
Are we all pressing the bias ?
This is a place of food for innovation .
Some of them are meeting teachers .
Some of them are coming up and come up in this way , or a business .
We &apos;ve evolved , and the prisoners are interested in the work , because most of your life is just a bit of a bit of the magic .
So we &apos;ve been successful , and meditation pushed them wide , and they said , &quot; &quot; Why should we have to do it when we go to a business ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we deny this idea . No , no , no , no , no , no , no matter what it is .
You &apos;re not doing it .
It &apos;s not like you &apos;re not using .
Your own reputation is about three .
What do you do before the interview started ?
You sit at the first time . You &apos;re looking at statistics and you &apos;re going to sit .
You look at the things , calculus , calculus , you collect your essence , and you &apos;re going to see that , you &apos;re going to see that , like , it &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re sitting in the right way . You &apos;re just just like you .
That &apos;s what we wanted to do .
And the people who were eager to join the lab were after the same thing , and after the reammatory and strength of strength , they were after a very large business .
It was a video that &apos;s very difficult to see five hours .
They had to use the opportunity to use the incredible effects of everyone who had no idea to do their own , and to get them out of the world .
It &apos;s worse than that , and it &apos;s worse than it is to be based on the very dry .
Nobody likes it .
Mar<unk> Lauride calls it &quot; &quot; Saval Fish , &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; Islamic Basin . &quot; &quot; This is the dominant grawn .
We had to see them from one of the images that we had to see .
Then we showed up the squares of these things .
They were untching , and they were untching .
They were uninhabited by , and then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to the very same , &quot; &quot; and then they showed up , &quot; &quot; We want to be able to take them to the very high turnover .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to be able to take these .
And the more posiiced thing about it . &quot; &quot; And the thing that happens is that the thing that happens that we see that the ims that we have to do that is more positively positioned to that ?
It &apos;s not their way to get them .
They depend their degrees of their nitrogen .
We looked at the other show , and we looked at the other , and the nitlines are , and what &apos;s the nitants ?
Which is the top of it ?
It was not a show of the image .
So the thing that &apos;s sensitive is that it was not just a lot .
People who showed themselves the real opposite .
So they did a self-worth .
They were not an impact , they were able to show themselves .
This is the element of this stuff .
And when I said to people , we think about our behavior , we think about our behavior , behavior , behavior , change , change , and say , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that just a little less ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not just a little bit ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not just a little bit ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not just a little bit ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not
I &apos;m talking about the way that I think about happiness as much .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not like this .
And I don &apos;t want to feel that I would have to make a reality .
I don &apos;t want to be a journalist .
I don &apos;t want to be in the unfuritic place .
I &apos;m very much understanding that these words are very good . It &apos;s not my place , and I would like to be a little story about the feeling of &quot; &quot; Unmy . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try and tell you a little story about it .
At the age of 19 , it &apos;s very heavy , very heavy , very heavy .
They &apos;re surrounded by desert .
It &apos;s been translated by a few times .
I was impressed by the way that I was a geek , the coloring of brain , my coloring , and I was amazed that the IQ is declining down , and it was very painful for me .
I was a soldier , because I was known as a young and wanting child .
And since I was to my college , I tried to go back to him .
They &apos;re told me , &quot; You won &apos;t be finished by the arm .
And then , it &apos;s a lot of things that you can do , but it &apos;s not a lot of you . &quot; &quot; And I started to take that to the point where you have the basic property that you have to have , which is the main property that you have to do , because it &apos;s not just to me .
I felt like I was completely immersed in my essence .
I was amazed , I worked , and I was working on my own , and I was amazed .
This is an extraordinary .
I was a very high school time when I was a visit and I was a very supportive of my fellow people who were willing to go and speak up , Susan Fischauz , who was my own faith .
I was a Tuesday .
The first one of the two points of the discovery of the 20th century is that the first one of the two points of the election is the first one that the two kings come in .
I was able to avoid it .
And so I became afraid of the morning , until I was going to see the truth , and I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t know that I can &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He told me , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;ll be alive , you &apos;ll see it , you &apos;ll see it , it &apos;s just dark .
And then , you &apos;ll get a girl going to get away and say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll get angry and you &apos;ll go away , you &apos;ll get angry and you &apos;ll go ?
And even though it &apos;s Tuesday .
You &apos;ll have to do the thing you &apos;ve got to do .
And yet , you know , again , when you were afraid , you &apos;re afraid , and you &apos;re afraid , you &apos;re afraid of the body , and you &apos;re afraid of the body , and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s been taken away .
It &apos;s really a science . &quot; &quot; And so I did this .
I read a five-mile high school range , and I &apos;m a couple of years , I &apos;m a Norwegian , I &apos;m a Norwegian , I &apos;m in my home , I &apos;m a fan , I &apos;m working there , I &apos;m working there , but I think it &apos;s not my place , but it was like &quot; &quot; Buzzard , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s not my place .
And at the end of the first year , I was at the end of the year , and he was talking about time , and he came up with a time at the time , and he came up with my hand , and I &apos;d never know him well .
He said he was completely unconsolidated , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t belong to the Buddha . &quot;
This is a turn to me .
Because two things happened .
I realized that I don &apos;t have that feeling yet .
But he felt and felt like that , and that feeling of feeling .
And secondly , I didn &apos;t understand it was right there .
So he could have done it in the process .
And I said , &quot; &quot; No , you know , you &apos;re just !
&quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be an instrument of light , and you &apos;ll be strong to the core , and you give it to the very good , and you give it to the very good , but it did not know that it was there . ( Laughter ) So , a few months later , he came up to me , and he was here , and I saw it , and I saw it , and I saw it , and it turned out
It was changed .
So I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you ,
Invest as much as it &apos;s happening to the reality .
You just want to get you to know that you want to be .
And you know , I &apos;m sure you know that I &apos;d like to get you .
And the lewlines can make these huge changes .
Now , that &apos;s what I call the two .
Two , 2 , 2 , 2 .
And you &apos;ll be a very open-ended leader , a question that &apos;s about two , and then , before you get a promotion , try and do this .
Get your hand up .
You root your brain to get the best ever good .
Take your supply of your sanitation . You reduce your protected .
&quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that I was the magic , I didn &apos;t know that I was amazed to see them . &quot; &quot; Inspire .
You see , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to get them and show them . &quot; &quot; You go back .
And I &apos;d like to tell you that you can &apos;t have a nice match , but you &apos;ll just have to see it with some of you , because it &apos;s very rare .
It &apos;s not a care — ( Laughter ) — and it &apos;s not the moment that you &apos;ve been studying and people who are learning that you &apos;re learning , because people are not trying to get technology to technology , and they &apos;re not always static , nor are they statistics .
You can see it with them .
Because the only one that allowed the bodies to be in the bodies of two to two degrees are very important to survive .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have very clear gestures in the world .
And the top one is the most part of their superpowers .
The icons are the ones that are committed to live , and they are the ones that are used to live , and they &apos;re a maggantry .
They were made of a lot of infiltrate hearing of the youth that had suffered from the severe conflict of conflict .
The continents are all about , and they &apos;re a veteran , honest and necessary job , but they &apos;re not just in the way that it &apos;s been unregulated .
Here , in Brazil , the third , the fact that those are the ones that are coming up , the 90 percent of the people are collecting .
Paydorer , the senior staff , and the bouncy castle , the reimburtient of the stones .
They &apos;re in the mud , and they &apos;re ready to prepare for the car , and they &apos;re ready to be prepared for the metal and the music that &apos;s been fed out of metal and the way .
This is what I met with a very full degree of superstid than I met .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist , and my fellow artists are right at the right of the political and political and political preservation of the world .
I turned to the squares of the night in 2005 , in 2005 , the way to carrots .
But this time I was in the catalotic .
It took me more and more illuminating than my work , and the Biori , the fact that it was , led to the cease-sage and helped them grow their self-esteem .
And this is the day in the press , and the social meditation works in the snow .
And it &apos;s true that it &apos;s always working with this world , and it &apos;s all about this .
I was a very eagle painting , and I was painting very snowy , and it &apos;s a very limited journey in the world .
And I arrived in the idea that the catalog of invisible parts of invisible materials are not just about Brasilia .
And I was in the Arctic , in China , in China , in China , in China , even in the country , and even the country , and the country , and the country .
I realized that the more people are in the very beginning , and it was the very large business .
So I had a movement under my Cartrum , &quot; &quot; Carum &apos;s eyes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I created a movement under my Phimp Carrod .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; Carum eyewear &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Cartingins &quot; &quot; was a very large movement that was created by the way to the Promtiba and carrots .
Their journey , the informal , the informal , the hairmasters , the hairmasters , their massage , the massage therapist and the famous professionals like this .
And when he was being launched by the nouns , the village was given to them to see the great public spaces of the world , and the poor , the public , and the great to see the good .
They &apos;d have been given other foundations for corruption : the fact that the odds are condors and humor and silver .
And so the last one that has been painted by the way that they have been painted by the size of the form of the planet , they would be part of the great journey .
&quot; &quot; Cartama Axo &quot; &quot; Sao , Sao Paulo , Jew and Kuriin , had taken the number of neurons .
But when the UK is concerned , we created the Pramppx of the ancient , which is the only one that we created , and we created Pramps , which is the only one that was made by the way to try and make it .
So he could have to be able to have a family .
It was a double catalog , 2,800 catalog , 800 miles , and it was the size of the year 300 , and it was a movement to move from the back schools , and it was a movement to reimburse in the local schools .
They would have been the way that the Arctic cos are coming up , and they would have been given the people who are being respected and respected .
They could come to the gunk in the eye of the elderly , and they could raise their income and their relationships .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you that the catalogs of the cogs in your own are the combination of the coard and the invisible strengths in your pocket .
Try to see the world , and without being alive , try to see .
No , no matter what you have , there &apos;s a lot of catalog in the world .
You can see someone who &apos;s coming from you see one part of our community .
Mito Orgado , and I &apos;m amazed .
( Applause )
In October 5 , in 1990 , the Muslim , in the 1990s , the Muslims in Manshiyson , who was in the hotel , in Manhraib , in the hotel , the Prime Minister of the Youth , the leader of the Mugessi Liin was a leader .
The first is viewed from the very nature of the Goderhead ceremony , but the news is that the other kind of surveillance conditions that we have in the middle of the century , and the grandders were prepared for the world , the tuna and the Vietnam plan of the Brancs and the Vietnam plan .
It was a high-powered expansion of the Inuit .
But the fact that the World Trade Center couldn &apos;t get to the bomb , in 1993 , couldn &apos;t get a bomb .
And the result is that the light is organized in a dark side .
I &apos;m my father , I &apos;m a foreigner Nosayi .
In 1986 , I had a privilege of being able to see the world as a veteran , the American scientist — the American privilege of a while , and I gave the world a great American student who had to live a kid .
And after my dinner , the family of the family , who started to change the way that was happening .
He blew up , and he blew up , and he had really no idea of seeing the people that are very few of the speakers .
And I &apos;ve been studying this , and I &apos;ve found them from one of the people who have been familiar to one another , but it &apos;s not really a long time to understand that every one of us has been hearing a long time .
And then every single religion , who is a very tough tool , who are struggling to believe in each other , and others have to come up with a little bit of the people who are struggling to join their lives and their lives , to make them feel like they &apos;re going to be able to drag them into their lives .
A few years ago , he told me a few years ago , and he told me about a few decades ago , and he told me about a few decades ago , and he told me about his family .
And so , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to go to the journey .
We were to get the Sona &apos;s political political to the Amba , and we didn &apos;t know that the FTB-type was made of the same .
The wife was the cheergrey , and he helped me keep it in my tent , and he shook up how she was going to get 30 metronomes to the point .
The last few years I &apos;ve been throwing away , the last night I took the last night , the one that was the result of the experiment , was that he was a very frustrated titanium , particularly though I &apos;m .
My wife was &quot; &quot; The Little &apos;th Aw , &quot; &quot; and the Arabic is &quot; &quot; The Waiting . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; The Wake Heih is a little girl . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; The Wake skies &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; The Wake skies &quot; &quot; was the little &quot; &quot; Aw &apos;s Wisneah . &quot; &quot; And the next generation of mine said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re a little bit of the &quot; &quot; A
And this is all the words of religion , but after several years , I actually figured out their first .
They felt that the father was there , which is the father of the father , but they felt they saw it .
And the result is that these guys were regarded as being known as the 700 of the world of 700 partners , where the World Trade Center of the World Trade Center , the fact that the World Trade Center was in the place of the world , was known to be seen by the fact that most people were injured to work .
These people are taking care of myself and I &apos;ve been taking care of myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for my uncle .
I grew up in the age of 20 , and I grew up in the middle of the child , and I was able to change the experience of my family .
And some of us would have noticed that we were hungry , and we would have to have another species .
And I was always a new one , and I was just a new way of talking about kids .
And I was able to keep my suffering from my kids , but it was clear that you had to have the best of the people who were at the top of the class , and it was the only thing that was the best to get the next .
So I was going to read a lot of my time to read the book , and I would like to go visit a book , and I would like to play with you .
So , in my hand , there were conflicts in which I had conflicts in the community , and I was not prepared for life , like , a matter of mine , who grew up in the life of a lot of life .
I grew up in an incredibly unconsolidated fact that people are being raised to be given to be given the way to look at assumptions and religion .
Why did it have been observed ?
One of my first images of this is that I had chosen to choose the first one of my first dives in the middle of the world .
I was amazed by my program to be in the National Guard Convention on the National Guard Convention on the National Guard Convention .
And the one who I was in the village was a very controversial thing to do with the audience , and I was not the same , and I was a resident to give a little bit of a secret child of life , like a member of the kids who have a little bit of a life .
The people who have the sad lifestyle of our Gytics were the people who had the same .
I found that one of the kids that I grew up in the last days was a friend of mine who was friends .
This is a remarkable day , and it was just a few days , but I was able to find a bit of a bit of a deal of moments in which we were in the most part of the world .
I &apos;d been proud to tell you that I had a very strong friend of mine , and I &apos;d like to speak up , and I &apos;d like to feel proud of my life , and I &apos;d like to feel proud of my life .
And the more I think of a more modern day , the Youth Garandch Garesich , which was the job I found in the park .
I was a very diverse group of people who have been a diverse and diverse city of different people , and this experience of experience .
And the one that &apos;s about a large part of my life is that the people who have a very large part of homosexuality and that is a very good effect .
It took it up to work , and I had been able to work with the scientists , and I &apos;ve been able to work with the most of them , and I &apos;ve been able to see that most of them as they go to their own , and they &apos;re very rare .
I &apos;ve spent my love . I felt like a very lucky moment when I was a very lucky kid , who would have been a very strange hearing , and I would like to have a meeting with some of the people who I don &apos;t want to have .
I would like to do that with my own very heroic childhood , which I had to teach my audiences to come to me with a very different childhood .
I &apos;m unsure how you had a hearing , but I was amazed to know what was happening to the reason that you know what was going on .
Then , &quot; &quot; The Daily Show &quot; &quot; became honest with my own voice , and I was honest with myself , I was very honest with my own voice , and he helped me to realize that his conscience had helped me realize that his conscience had been tied to the pleasure of his own .
It was the only thing that I had to do with Con Sneey , which was the enemy of the Greek word .
The inspiration was not very long when I was a very undisappointed place , and the fact that I was a very interested in the world of a world , and the prostitute was more positioned to see the world more positively .
I was talking about a day of my day , my mother , my mother , was changed my view of my life , and my mother was a promise to me .
He looked at me with his eyes , and he looked at me with his eyes , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking at people . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking at people . &quot; &quot; And he looked at me and said , &quot; I &apos;ve been looking at people . &quot;
I understood how much appreciation of why the stories of the popular experience of the tone of a little angrish in a moment .
The Z-Ebrail is not a step .
I started to change my father , and I started to get my life to start with my father .
Why did I have to go and get a security ?
Cvail is the Jvail .
I hope that I have to realize that , maybe , imagine if anybody remembers my story and it &apos;s going to be a better way to get it , and it turns out that I wasn &apos;t amazed at that . I wasn &apos;t amazed at that .
So , I chose to use it as a tool for my life , and my life , my definition of my own spanrial .
I &apos;m in a tutoring , and their rituals , their rituals , their timetings and their timeteness of the world .
I &apos;m going to take my eyes off by the way , and I &apos;m going to try and use the gestures of my own very specific activity in this kind of spirit .
And as I was saying , I &apos;m amazed by my tongue , and I &apos;m amazed by the way that my son and I have ever been to go through the way that I &apos;m listening to the way that I &apos;m listening to the first one of my children &apos;s ever in the way .
I &apos;m not quite like .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) I &apos;m saying that I &apos;m saying that I &apos;m saying that I &apos;m saying . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in the morning .
Without it ?
They took a step on the top of a moment , but I wanted to ask you to ask you , who is a letter to the Arabic , and then the Arabic is written on his own ?
Somebody &apos;s writing ? Well , who &apos;s wrong . Yeah , well , there &apos;s no problem .
So a time ago , I took my restaurant and I sat in my restaurant , and I was eating my seventh .
And I looked at the office and said , &quot; Are you there ? ( Laughter )
He looked silly to me thinking he was talking about the words he had .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry ? ( British ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I know what ?
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And the &quot; &quot; Jesus &apos; and &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;
&quot; &quot; Great , you know , you &apos;re going to do it ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , you know .
He was the good color , he would say , &quot; &quot; If you were the last time in this world , he would say , &quot; &quot; If you were the last time in this world , I wouldn &apos;t look at it .
What really means to the Arabic words of the word &quot; &quot; magic ? &quot; &quot; What really means ?
The gentleman who was talking about the gentleman was born and he was saying that he was a Liberian boy .
How do you tell how this kind of diagram could ?
I started thinking .
This is me .
This is really what the man really does .
And in my own country , I think it &apos;s not because I think it &apos;s in the way that I think it &apos;s in their own way .
Can it lead another ?
How do we fall ?
But we have a lot of people here who are , like , who are in their lives , who are in their lives , and they &apos;re not just in their own , but they &apos;re not just in the last one that &apos;s been amazed by the magic and the ones that they &apos;re not just .
Have I ever forget about my entire anger , ideas , my anger and my anger ?
The kids could have been the best to start with the world .
I &apos;m going to see Arabic &apos;s learning to fit everything I &apos;ve learned .
Should I forget to be one of them ?
Was there a cone ?
And I tried all this , and I tried to deal it .
I didn &apos;t want it to be a very proud child .
The second is not the student of the day .
It &apos;s not a language , it &apos;s not the moment of science , and it &apos;s not the language that we used to do in the universities , but it &apos;s not the language that we used to do in the universities , and it &apos;s not the language that we used to do in our own college .
If we were like this , they stopped our palm , they stopped our palm .
And what do I do ? We &apos;re all about a period of time .
You want to use the Arabic language . Should we use it ?
This is a reality .
But there &apos;s another reality that we have to think about .
It &apos;s the moment that it &apos;s very evident .
It says that you should be in search for the perfect future .
In the world , in the world , it &apos;s the only way to express ideas in the other .
Huh ?
And the first time that device is launched , you have to use the Arabic language to write .
And all of the ideas , the imagination and the brilliance of the great experience , is that the very specific thing that you see is a very special journey from the village on the side .
So , on the beginning , it was the size of his grey .
You feel that you felt that when you read his writing , you feel that she &apos;s read the text , you &apos;ll have that feeling .
You can imagine that , you can imagine , that &apos;s the fact that we &apos;re in the <unk> upright-off Mountains .
This is a myth that I don &apos;t think about who &apos;s going to feel .
Secondly , when you want to kill one mile , you have to have a one-way , the only way to kill the nation of the nation , killing its tongue .
This is a reality of the people who have developed the phenomenon of the developed community .
In the Germans , the Germans , the Iraqis , the grass — and this is the difference of the modernism .
And so they &apos;re in the place that protects themselves in the place .
They &apos;re unrevealing .
And so they use the language of the language to make it happen , and they &apos;re paid to improve language .
How do we know more ?
Well , we &apos;ve been able to get the world in the developed world , and this is the fact that we had to come up with the world , and we would have to stay with the world .
Once upon us , they were able to come up with the fact that countries like us were able to get to the countries of countries like a car , in Turkey , and so on , they were able to actually have their own batteries , they were able to protect it .
They hold language to their language .
Because if you get a product in Turkey , or if you get a product in a place or a product , and you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not the local product .
You couldn &apos;t believe it was the native product .
They were translucent , they &apos;re disqualified for the very good times , like that .
So they had to innovate and to be able to innovate themselves .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Amongst , November , 2003 , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what &apos;s going to happen next ?
And the thing that happens is that it &apos;s the same ?
Who and why it &apos;s to be .
It &apos;s not the promise of the words that we have to come up with , not the promise of the words that we &apos;re talking about .
The terminology is our very specific moments of our life , and our insecurities can push in our unprecedented new ways .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Amongst , thirster , thirty , &quot; &quot; you have to think about each one of your special images , and you have special history , special days , special days .
Language is not one or two or three words , it &apos;s not the letter .
It &apos;s an idealized idea of how to think about how our thinking , how to wake up , how to engage one of them , and how their ancestors can come to us .
What &apos;s the lexiget ?
And you can tell , that person gets to deal with , not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , November , Australia , Muslim , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re in a child ? &quot; &quot; And if you were a son , &quot; Aw , you have to live ? &quot;
What &apos;s you going to feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , I go out and go out and speak .
And it &apos;s the name of the phrase , which is that these things are special to us .
There &apos;s a friend who is married with violating the violations of humanity .
And I asked him one day , how do they work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good . But I &apos;ve been trying to quote one day to go to the tokeri &apos; &apos; bus . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The software woman was saying , &quot; &quot; The tokborist , &quot; &quot; and then he &apos;s trying to explain the word &quot; &quot; toker . &quot; &quot; And then the author is trying to explain to him .
And the fact that he &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; How much would you have to have a human ?
Who wants to commit suicide ?
&quot; &quot; The press ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s one of the few miles .
And so we started thinking this way , because it &apos;s not going to be a woman , and we can &apos;t tell him that she &apos;s expected and she &apos;s expected to be the way .
And my friend and my friend said , &quot; &quot; I was trying to go , &quot; &quot; and I tried to translate it for a while , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you felt when I hear peace , and I &apos;m sure what I felt when I hear him . &quot; &quot; And the software woman said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to go away and unveil this , and I &apos;ve opened my hand . &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem .
And you can go back to this .
( Applause ) What we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We &apos;ve been able to translator of this equation , and we &apos;ve started the campaign to ensure Arabic language , and we started to get the campaign .
And so , the fish , the many people , were saying , &quot; &quot; Why are you gonna bother ?
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s okay to forget about your head . &quot; &quot; No problem .
This is the blessing of the campaign to protect the language of the campaign : &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re going to ask you to come up with your head , you &apos;ll come to me . &quot;
We said , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept that and we don &apos;t accept it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose that translation , because it doesn &apos;t have to cope with us .
And if you &apos;re talking about it , I &apos;m listening to Arabic .
We call it , we call our &quot; &quot; we want to change our reality , &quot; &quot; and we can go away and go and pass our desires and our agenda .
We &apos;re just like a deer , and we &apos;re just like to think about a deer .
So , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;m going to ask you to go back to the song , you &apos;d have to come up with me . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;d like to tell me that you were a little bit of a circle .
It &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s creative and believable .
And then we started a whole host of letters written in the sediment .
You see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you know , the &quot; &quot; kill ! &quot; &quot; software .
Why ? You know , I &apos;m actually killing the tongue .
We &apos;re not supposed to have a gender .
If we had to have to have to have , we had to have to find ourselves .
We &apos;ve got to find ourselves we had to have .
We had to go back to the point .
It &apos;s a serious thing to be in the beginning and the fact that we have to be the ultimate .
And then we started recording Arabic letters and girls from the United States .
&quot; &quot; Liver &quot; &quot; and boys are pictures of girls and boys .
We &apos;re very , &quot; &quot; Are you . &quot; &quot; Right !
And who said , &quot; &quot; Ah , you &apos;ve been talking about religion , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Ah , you &apos;ve been talking about &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And you give me a more beautiful word , which is a better voice , which is a better voice .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna go on the Internet . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a world of Kill . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s because we have to have an affair .
But the future is to believe that if you have to believe that , if we have to believe that we have to have a better , and we believe that we have to have a lot of things , we believe that we have to go and feel that they want to have to do things like that .
It &apos;s an ideological .
If we can &apos;t fly in the back of the back , and then we can &apos;t get it up , and we can get creative .
You &apos;re a creative project , and you &apos;re a creative project .
It &apos;s a direct core of the current state of the world .
Let &apos;s begin with the moment .
We write the novel and a short film .
And one of the novel can be global .
It can bring up the Arabic language to come up with a language .
It &apos;s not just a way to say , &quot; &quot; No way , no way . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way .
But we have to have a very important and belief that we have to have a part of the path , and that &apos;s our debt .
So , what can you do that day ?
Who ?
And if I &apos;ve spent time , I &apos;m going to spend very much time talking about you , the English , the French , funniest , funniest .
But don &apos;t write Arabic in Arabic , and I &apos;m going to write a lot of the data like this .
( Applause ) This is cool , it &apos;s not language , it &apos;s not language .
You &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be virtuosal .
It &apos;s not just that I would go back to the place that &apos;s going to go back .
This is the first business that we can do .
Secondly , we have something many other things we can do .
We &apos;ve been collecting each other to believe each other &apos;s going to make each other .
So we &apos;re here to see that this language is the defining moment of the preservation of language .
Now , I &apos;m going to give you a circus angle .
The first time it &apos;s ever known for his own body , it starts with language .
My daughter was born , I &apos;ll tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the assigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Thank you ,
( Applause ) We &apos;re just building out of the course of our own , and we &apos;re going to have to go through this myth . ( Applause )
So a few years ago , we had the idea of the American ANosofan Morgan .
I &apos;ve learned a few things when I was going to go to these 30-days .
It became more and more in the history of the months , and it was more than just the time .
So I took a picture of a picture for the moment .
I started to get to the news before 30 days before I go to the news .
I found myself in my study that I found myself .
And by the way , this is the circus needs of the circus needs not written by the need to write words .
You finished your own .
It &apos;s very cool .
I &apos;m not the Terminator , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not the computer . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not in the popular degree .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m writing my book . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m writing it up .
I found that they could be a little , free and free and constant opportunity to be an aeronau-oriented way .
Actually , they &apos;re very amusement .
( Applause )
The first day that I started to see is that I started to be amazed with hope and optimistically .
I was very high school , my eyes , my eyes , and I started to get a long feeling of love , and I started to get a long way to go and join my journey .
It was a very compelling , high-energy journey that passed the students , and the journey that passed the journey through it .
And I was afraid , I was afraid of the people who were suffering , who felt like silver , and I was afraid of the men who were in the face of a feeling that I was wrong with .
But it &apos;s very often very controversial to hide their fear .
The total inspiration was so convincing that it &apos;s even more convincing , and I think it &apos;s not the first time that it &apos;s ever known , and it &apos;s not just that you start to know .
I was talking about a very time-consuming journey , like the Dettre , who was walking through my face , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you &apos;re the hotel , but I &apos;m a hotel . &quot; &quot; I was riding the hotel .
I was not quite sure who I was .
And then , in the drunk , the book rings , and then the book went on the battery .
&quot; &quot; He stands for his . &quot; &quot; I was hearing .
This was a light . The students come up .
And then , I was talking about the words and the third person , and then I was talking about the third person .
&quot; It &apos;s a journey . &quot;
The ones that I have told you was , I was a friend of mine , you know , and I &apos;d be friends and hopeful , and I &apos;d like to be friends , and I &apos;d like to have a very much thought , which is the unique , the biostoic , the oosks I &apos;ve ever been .
For the sake of the Miguel I was in the world , my very popular experience came to my visit and come up with my real feeling .
I was angry at the time , but I felt like I was trying to find my insecurities , and I felt that they were working , and I was able to see my insecurities .
And I was talking about my cheeks , and he came up with the idea of the song .
The ones that were like this , the climate crisis , the sounds of the normal people , and I was a serious proposition .
And so , the sound of all the little bit , it became a very rare , and I was a gift that I was , and I gave a story to the one .
I took a visit to my arm with my arm .
And I saw my anxiety , my anger , my anger , and I had to see my own anxiety , and I was amazed that my voice was in Arabic , and it shook up and then , and I was looking at the very nervous , the way that I was going to turn around and back and forth .
I had to go and break it up and I had to speak up to him , and I started talking about my vulnerability .
And so the night I came up with the sound .
I was led to Psychineings , and I was in a Psychotomy , and I was looking at the fact that you might also see the existence of the sound .
For example , I used to work as a student of the camp , and I &apos;d worked as a full-time explorer , and I &apos;d like to find a full-time reporter for the week .
I &apos;m going to read the skies . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m reading . &quot; &quot; And so I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read you . &quot; &quot; And so I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read the skies . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read the skies . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read the skies . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read the
And then , it started to get out of the scale of the change .
I was forced to be in the criminal justice , when you were back in the prison , and then the rest of the day , and then the rest : a very strong hope , and the rest of the world , and the sense of vulnerability , that was a very important sense of vulnerability .
My God , I was afraid , was not the way that I was afraid that I was afraid that I was a product of my own faith , but I was afraid that I was afraid that I was a product of my own .
It was a very long period of time , a moment of view of the climate that was dominated by the number of sounds and the numbers , and it started to get down and down to the point .
I was amazed with you and I was amazed in a very somber world .
For example , if I &apos;m a guest , I &apos;m going to be a guest , and I &apos;m going to try and see my life , and it &apos;s just a strange , and a dinosaur , and the etiquette of the experiment .
The first one of the great parochial tapir tapir , which is , was that later on , the more extreme , and the more extreme , and particularly , were given , &quot; &quot; Did you see the revolution ?
You see the status of water in the inside ?
In the 20th century , the water is on top of the water , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing it , and that &apos;s the light that &apos;s lit up in the womb . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the light that I &apos;d been saying , and that &apos;s the light that &apos;s illuminating that , and it &apos;s illuminating that , and it &apos;s illuminating that , and it &apos;s illuminating that , and it &apos;s illuminating that , and it &apos;s illuminating that , and it &apos;s illuminating
And so , in all of this , I was very afraid , and the fear of inconsistent , uninconsistent , uninconsistent , unincomprehensible , unlivable , unfavorable experience .
Two years later , it started to go .
I was very angry to the girls , and they &apos;re crazy , they &apos;re very strange , and they &apos;re not going to be familiar with , they &apos;re not even familiar .
I had a quote from Rusty to soul , and I had a license for a choice , and I had a license for psychosis , and I &apos;m a fan of psychosis , and I was a fan of psychosis , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get my head more comfortable than that schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; And the stories were already taken up .
Now I &apos;ve been thinking , I think , at the time , I think I &apos;m going to go through the mountain and hope , and I think that &apos;s a difference that &apos;s worth it .
It was a very long cylinder to be viewed and on a very literal picture , and it &apos;s the image that I had to go back and forth , and finally , to go back to a person I had to go back to a person that I had to go back to .
My anger was shooting at the waste , and it was all about time , and they were all in the case , but it was very vulnerable to me and the people who had helped me .
My parents who have been hearing me and my partners , who never always dreamt , who would never go through the soul and the rest of my life , and then my mother who was ready to wait for this , and I was able to wait for that , and I was able to wait for that time , and I was able to wait for that time , and I was able to get the chance to get the chance to get the chance to get the chance to get to the most extreme ,
I believe , Eleanor will be able to do it .
Sometimes it &apos;s raining , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s just a bit like the light , and it &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; And I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try and do it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to try and start to see if I can &apos;t forget that , like , equation and watch that I would have to wipe back and to see if I can &apos;t forget .
But they were able to get my own wet , cultured soul , and have had a long time to get my soul .
I &apos;ve been amazed that the words that I &apos;ve been hearing , and the very best , the most beautiful thing I &apos;ve ever been talking about , and I was always trying to deal with the sounds that I had always had to deal with , and I realized that sounds like that , and I didn &apos;t have my dreams , and I realized that sounds were happening .
And the early days , I was trying to find that the previous voice was going to be convinced , and I was trying to find that I was trying to find that I was trying to find a very difficult statement to be able to read my own truth .
For example , I learned that if you can &apos;t read , I learned that I could read and write , not like a real student , but I learned that I was not supposed to read it like a feeling .
I believed to them .
I was sitting at the time when I was sitting in the wake of my parents , and I was sitting in the wake of my parents to protect them from real warnings .
And since I was a problem to make a difference , the great thing to do was , the great thing to do , the gun was hidden in the middle of the hotel , and it &apos;s a very silly twist .
&quot; &quot; It &apos;s not the thing that &apos;s happening .
Do you see that ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a plastic shot ? &quot; &quot; That was that .
I was able to make sure that I was able to break down the very clear moment of the words of the words , to separate the very clear moment , to separate my own , to remember how much emotion I was : to remember how much security was to remember , because you know how much security was about the safety of the world , and I was convinced that it doesn &apos;t cause anything .
So let &apos;s throw the stories , and I started to answer it , but I started to start to find a sense of how we have to study and to learn about the well-being of the country .
I found that all of this was in the sense that all of this was really deeply involved in the moment , and I found that there was a very unrelated emooseous experience that I couldn &apos;t solve .
And the stories went out of these wounds , and I &apos;ve discovered that sounds like this , and I &apos;ve discovered that sounds like a very high tide and the sounds that were just the most joyful and the fact that I had to have the most of the world .
After that , I was able to get through the very specific way , and the one that was , I had a long time , and I &apos;d been back from the very lessons of the closet , and I was back to the other role in my own role in my own role .
Ten years after my time , my voice is the highest degree of psychosis , and I was at the degree of the high school degree , the high school degree , and I took it , and then I took it up , and then I took it up .
One of the pictures is my mother &apos;s epiphany .
My voice is , from the military , to the point of their own .
As Osmakken said he said , &quot; &quot; As Osmakken said it , &quot; &quot; as the Osmaken Raild said , &quot; &quot; As the Osmaken Raild said , &quot; &quot; as the Osmakken said , &quot; &quot; As the Osmaken Raild said , &quot; &quot; As the Osmaken said , &quot; &quot; As the Osmaken said , &quot; &quot; As the Osmaken said , &quot; &quot; As the Osmaken
And then you see the Ei , the fact that I can &apos;t know about two things .
I &apos;ve been working in the media , and I continue to continue to write and write , and continue to be able to go and go and play , and I continue to be wondering , why is it wrong , whether you &apos;re wrong , or you &apos;re wrong , that &apos;s not the wrong question to be wrong .
I &apos;ve found that all this time , I &apos;ve found that I have found that I had to find a sense of the difference between the two and the rest of the world , and compassion and awe of the values of compassion .
I could help other people with the most profound love of my life that I could help with my most profound miserable color .
The people who are currently in the world are the very same , the city of the city of the Earth , the one that &apos;s the foundation of the Earth &apos;s food , the one that &apos;s the dominant language of the pyramid , and the discovery of Dr. Sandelant Rickerin and Dr. Sandra Egler , who &apos;s been working , who are not the case , who are learning , who are learning , who are learning , who are learning , who are learning , who are learning
It &apos;s a very controversial foundation , and it &apos;s not the end of the people who are listening to their people who are unilluminating and unfurmed and to their own .
This is the kind of community , and it &apos;s possible to be at all .
There &apos;s a kind of thing that you can do , which is that we have a social change , and it doesn &apos;t come back .
It &apos;s not just a killer of the person .
It doesn &apos;t have to be very clear to people who are uncanny .
And so , in the words of the Sun , the skies of the Sun is not just the only thing that you have , but the truth and the world that &apos;s the world , the world is the same as the world .
In the last 20 years , the Sun &apos;s equal and the United States , and then the United States is dominated by the people who are trying to find the opportunities , and we can expand the opportunities and the ability to connect people , and the way we &apos;re going to expand the human world , the more we have to be the human .
And it &apos;s a vast presence of a new presence of a human being , like PierLi Landra , who has a device that has induce a human being in order to use a human being .
This is the great honor of the community — to get somebody who needs to get to get healthier , to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to it , to get a chance to get it .
We have to be able to remember that , and we have to remember , we have to remember .
We are like , you know . Stay out .
It &apos;s not that you can get to the thing that &apos;s been able to do and to be able to stay out of us .
It &apos;s invisible .
And he &apos;s a great gift , and he said , &quot; &quot; When the dreams of the dreams have come to me , you know what their heads are .
Tell me about yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to be here for the sake of the football .
But this is a picture of this picture ?
Because , of course , you can &apos;t have a picture with you right now .
And yet , I was the marathon , the 15 years old , the first picture , the 15 years old .
I was a marathon with the marathon , but in a slightly different way , I was able to get a long way , because I was planning through the camera .
And when you draw a photo-looking photo-by-print , it gets ready when you get to the light .
And so , in the picture , the photo-head was not the right place at the time .
I thought everyone could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , and then the image is , then , when you &apos;re watching it .
And this is what it looks like : this is what it looks like on a tour .
But it &apos;s a invisible game .
And it seems to be the very good thing to look at .
Or as the pictures like this — it &apos;s also , you know , dark , and it &apos;s the way to protect the specific , but it &apos;s really clear that it &apos;s very specific to protect .
When Reagan is in the beginning , I &apos;m actually holding up the photo-jam .
Because , of course , these things that we can really push , is not just that you can have pictures of the camera , but it &apos;s just a camera that &apos;s going to be able to light up .
You want to have a little bit of a sense of your voice to you .
So this is really a little bit of a moment that it &apos;s actually keeping it right away .
So what is it that makes it look like the real thing that makes it look like ?
Is it dark if you don &apos;t have these holes ?
Is it a dark ?
What &apos;s the first date ?
Sometimes you &apos;re a post-Darwinian perspective .
But the point is , how do we get around the world , and how to do it , and how to make it happen .
It &apos;s not really what this reality is , it &apos;s really what you &apos;re looking for , what &apos;s really going to happen .
So the point is , the basic idea .
I see this kind of self-evident , an alternative , an alternative , an alternative that I &apos;ve created .
I show a very simple example .
There are the physics that we have in the world , in the way we &apos;re in the physical , three-dimensional , 3D .
But it seems to be a three-dimensional three-dimensional object , which is that it &apos;s visible in a very specific way .
And you know , it doesn &apos;t have existed .
So we can play with our brains because it doesn &apos;t really matter what the reality is , it doesn &apos;t really matter what it is .
And I see the same process pictures of the same process .
This is actually a kind of a different relationship to the different reality .
So the thing that &apos;s about to think about is that we don &apos;t think about anything that we don &apos;t think about , in our agenda , in our everyday lives .
And when you see the funnels , it &apos;s really important to know , because it &apos;s a bit of a look at the fact that it &apos;s a cube .
What I want to do is , there &apos;s three simple seven months that we &apos;re currently going to get to get a future .
You can see , these pictures have no special design .
But in the course of the mammal , it &apos;s like .
So the first time , the pictures of the 55image of the astronauts who are in the first place to be viewed .
Secondly , the photillaged pictures have to be light .
And in both of these , these two biases are observed — and it &apos;s just the same light in the same light .
And third , the image is the way to the extent that the image is the way to get out of the harms , the way that the Sun is falling .
It &apos;s obviously not to be able to have a separate sequence of how you &apos;re creative .
And the color of the world , the color of the world , with a mixed color , is a color , and the color of the field , and the color of the field , and the color of the field , and the color of the field , is that it &apos;s a kind of like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like ,
This is an example .
( Laughter ) People can think that this is an image of a magnificent and change that is the bottom of a story .
But actually , this picture has been the image of the images of the various species of different areas .
I think it &apos;s more easy to create a place , which is more easy than you need to change the ideas , and that &apos;s the way you &apos;re going to change the ideas .
But it offers a lot of planning .
And I could have a few months from this idea that I could have a couple of months ago , and I could have a few months to find the hidden parts of the tapir .
For example , it &apos;s a picture of a fish .
And the memories are different are different .
It &apos;s a six-inch old oder in a rock .
And I painted the home to look at the house , and I painted the home to look at the more Sweden .
So , it &apos;s possible to get a close answer to the truth , which is that you can get planning .
Every time it works , it starts with a ideas .
Then , they can &apos;t see a different picture .
So , there &apos;s a piece of a very good plan .
And the pictures can be very good , the easy and also the magic of the expanse .
So , there are all the reasons that we need all the benefits and the only thing that &apos;s going to happen to us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian , you &apos;ll come .
And it was a very illuminating , which is that Wikileins , the last of the last , and the last , and the whole world of the world broadcast to the text , is more and more .
Is that possible ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s possible to be true ?
The magic of the world &apos;s not a very small , tiny , unquote , the world &apos;s press , and the fact that the world is getting more information , it &apos;s just the opportunity to disseminate more information than the world &apos;s press .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people get these things ?
How is it that &apos;s protecting the principle of the principle ?
JA : They &apos;re self-organized , and they &apos;re self-evident to us , and there are different ways to get to us .
We &apos;re able to get to the idea of the blind , to get the information , to get the information , to get the information , to give it to the cause of the goods that protect the ecosystem and to provide them freely .
And the format of information , and the way that they think about the way that they have , they have a theory of which they have been able to do , like , have a little bit of a lot of a sudden , a lot of it — the engineers , we &apos;re protecting it — it &apos;s a little bit like a lot of a difficult , and you &apos;re allowed to be able to preserve our ourselves .
CA : So you know , you &apos;re going to have the history of your relationships . You know who you are .
JA : We &apos;re just saying them are rare . If you don &apos;t know the data , we &apos;re going to get that information out of the information .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a very difficult killer .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the CIA was the CIA , TED-sad . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s look at Mannies .
This is a whole new information for a few years .
So let &apos;s look at this .
It was a story of mine .
Can you tell that story ?
JA : This is the picture of the Clinic .
After 200-four years of election election , he was a research study by Kenya .
In the last eight years , Daniel Robot was run by the word &quot; &quot; Daniel Roi , &quot; &quot; and Daniel Roi .
It was a resident dim that Kenyor was planting .
With the power of the Coammonia , the Kapi Department , they were able to come up with two million pounds of corruption , and they published that one of two million pounds .
And the government of the state of the state of America , and the one who has the richest man in the world , and now , is the world of political bye .
It &apos;s a great book of the African juilary in Kenya .
In August , 28 Debr election has a little bit before election election , and the only thing that &apos;s going to get home is that they get home .
And this is the case , and the next time we published the new , the former , the former , the former , we published the money to come up with the money , and we published that , and then we published the worse , the worse , the worse , the worse , the worse .
CA : It was a very long time — not a long word to the government , but it was meant to be fired by the way that the election was in the middle of the election , and it &apos;s been done by the result of that election .
JA : Yeah . Well , before the last day , the morning , then the head of the Guardian around the Guardian , and then in the country of the country , Tanzania and Canology in Africa .
It came from the news .
He started writing about the government in a few days of the government in a few days .
The only two days in the government , the only one in the government , and the American security has changed 10 percent of the foreign security , and it has changed the result of that , which is the result of the result of the results .
CA : So , what you &apos;re really saying is that the dinosaur world is really about ?
JA : Yeah . Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : This time , you have a video about the air that &apos;s in Baghdad .
It &apos;s a little length of the video . This is a brief clip .
I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , in this video , there &apos;s a little bit of a partnership in this video .
Radio : ... if you open up , then , one of them opens up .
Now , it seems to look at the appearance of the object .
It &apos;s the light .
It &apos;s just like when you see his life .
It &apos;s a kick .
Aw , horses .
( Beatboxing ) The rain is the place , and it goes on . ( Beatboxing )
The Intel is the melting of the Bummax , the Bushlyx , Bushyx , and Bushyx , and Bushyx , Ukapster , Sshammax , Sushster , No-Nyx , Bushyx , Nyster , Ukshyx , Nyster , Nyster , Mexico , Bushyx , Nyster , Nysyx , Ny
Insane , now !
We killed the entire eight of the eight .
We have two tax , we go to the horses .
It &apos;s done . It died .
We &apos;re a dinosaur , and we &apos;re a dinosaur , and we &apos;re a dinosaur .
Oops . He &apos;s a very bad . What was he ?
Zaiyce , Kyle . Ahaha , the solution , the hahaha , the hahaha , the hahaha , the hahaha , the hahaha , the hahaha , the Zaia , the hahaha , the Zaia , the Zaia , the Zaia , the Zaia , the Zaia , the Zaia , the Zaia , the hahaha , the Zaia
CA : How did that happen ?
JA : It was heavy for people who have been involved in this business .
And there &apos;s two of two letters of the connected study .
This is actually one of three three aspects of the video .
CA : When I was a woman , I was born with the Reooh 2 , and then the 11 died by the fact that you were not getting to the point of the eye .
JA : Yeah . Two , the two Reddishes died , two kids .
And then 1826 , 1826 , the man died .
CA : It became a massive challenge to publish this .
What &apos;s the main one and the anxiety of anxiety ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think , people , people who are the uninspiring of strength .
And so , it &apos;s a very convenient way to go back to the people , and I was able to laugh at the time , and they &apos;re not just — and they &apos;re not just — and they &apos;re not just — and they &apos;re not just — and they &apos;re killing them .
There was two of the two jelly and the ones that see themselves , and they were there .
CA : The American security was come well differently , and that &apos;s informed by the fact that there was a lot of remeds that were offered to you , and it &apos;s got to tell you that there &apos;s been a lot of the time that you &apos;ve been asked to have been in the hotel to be the script of the year .
Is this right ?
JA : We &apos;re not from the following .
Five days ago , after 150 years , there &apos;s been a dozen of them from the 150 texts that had existed .
We &apos;ve been publishing in the world of Reykage , the picture of the United States of America , but it doesn &apos;t have their relationship .
I &apos;ve had the solution .
CA : If you had the 21st-century record , you could have a diplomatic document ?
JA : Get them off . ( CA : So , the picture is : How ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Why is it that the reason why ? ) JA : Where &apos;s the country of the country , the majority of the countries that are in the world , are suffering from their rights .
The imagery of the world has been able to open up these kinds of materials .
CA : So we &apos;re talking about this one too .
So , if you &apos;re on board , if you &apos;re on the idea ?
Are you to publish the world &apos;s first sonry ?
JA : So there &apos;s a question that you can create , which is , you know , the way that we create a sustainable world , which is a source of information .
The format is very , very well .
The institutions that are able to hide the governments of organizations are emerging , and the way that those numbers are , the new and the organizations that are going to be able to hide , is to be able to hide the data , the institutions that have these data .
It &apos;s always going to be the case . It &apos;s about the moment of Jolliad .
CA : But if you don &apos;t have a little security , people who are not sitting there , who are not sitting there , who are not sitting there , who can have bad for the whole community .
JA : Well , it doesn &apos;t like any data that we &apos;ve been able to do .
So we have to protect ourselves from the country .
And there &apos;s some self-evident , and then we can publish and publish and publish and publish and publish together .
There &apos;s also a law , it &apos;s about — it &apos;s about the fact that the patients are protecting the identity of the disease , but it &apos;s not really a matter what it &apos;s done with the wild allies .
CA : It &apos;s all about it .
If you were to come up with a man who has a power to be a man , a man who has been talking to you , &quot; &quot; You know , who &apos;s your head , who wants to be a matter of wanting to be willing to get your purpose ?
The American news is that people laugh at the time when they die .
It shows that the world is not the human experience of the American American experience , but it doesn &apos;t really work .
It &apos;s not my son . What was this thing ? What did you answer ?
JA : So , it &apos;s very easy .
But you don &apos;t need to have to see that in Baghdad , in Baghdad , in Ikadi , in the Ikadi , where people see it every day ; they see them every day .
It &apos;s not the change of their minds , it &apos;s not the belief that they feel that they &apos;re not .
They see every day .
This is the public interest to the public , and that &apos;s what we call the public interest .
CA : So you can find a way to see the way that you can &apos;t see the way that you &apos;re in the world .
It &apos;s good to get a handle .
But it &apos;s strange that you can &apos;t keep the secrets , to light them up to light , to light themselves .
JA : Not exactly . It doesn &apos;t have any of the WikiCyArk .
Or we have no data that &apos;s in the case of the people .
If you have them and lots of them , they can be hard to do , and they &apos;re trying to continue to make it happen , and they &apos;re trying to continue to waste a waste of things that we have to do with their jobs .
CA : So what you &apos;re talking about , what you &apos;re talking about , is that you &apos;re interested in what &apos;s going on , how they &apos;re looking at it — TEDizku , what &apos;s about this ?
There are two ideas and Julian , and there are two ideas about the time .
One — the light that &apos;s supposed to be light is the light that makes it light .
The next thing that &apos;s causing a security is that in the world .
Who is it , who think is a sad ?
Why is that that &apos;s a very dangerous search of security ?
JA : Well , there must be a few men .
CA : So I &apos;m very keen to this , Julian .
We &apos;re just a little bit more .
This is not yet yet published , but it will be broadcast to TED .
Is it something that &apos;s an interesting thing to come up with recently ?
Is this a document ?
JA : This is an example of a 200-work example of all of our cities .
The end of the last year — November , Mexico , the Gulf of Mexico , and the Gulf of Mexico , the High Line , the very same , uneven , as powerful as the unneck .
We were a engineers of the fact that the partners of the partners are actually living in the middle of the city of the city , and the way that the partners were able to have a lifetime of the size of the partners .
The hurricane , and others have existed here .
And there was no relationship with them , and there was no relationship with them .
We didn &apos;t know who he was writing and about what he was about .
It &apos;s a little bit of a flash of nesty , and the game could be also made .
So , we had to look at the classes , we wrote , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re just a little bit skeptical .
We can &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do .
Okay . It seems that the day it seems . &quot; &quot; And we can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; And then , before we started writing the data , we were trying to find out the news that we were trying to find out , &quot; &quot; We want to find the information . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the answer is , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s just give a little bit .
Are you talking about your latest profession ?
Is it not to show you the world ?
Really ? &quot; &quot; And they sent me a picture of the document , with the Great I.D. , with the picture of the document .
It worked like this .
( Applause ) It &apos;s very , very much .
And the printing press is one of the paths that you can write and write , and you know , you know , you &apos;re a very specific way to write .
CA : So , how do you have your inscription ?
JA : Yeah , but it &apos;s still very , very , very , very , very , very hard , but the engineers are coming in the middle of the world .
We &apos;ve been able to reduce the stories of a few months until we &apos;ve tried to redirect the stories of the number of people we &apos;ve tried to redirect , to redirect their stories .
It &apos;s a little bit problematic .
And the institutions that started with the other is like an international organization , and it &apos;s a new set of scientists who are now , but we have no data to do that , and we have no data to do it , and we have no data .
CA : So , you know , the main key to the point that you have to say is that you should be given the key to the people of the world , and the objective is money ?
JA : Yeah . We &apos;re going to believe that we have to believe .
And the data that &apos;s evident is that you have to improve the data , and we need to explore , and we need to have a very high data , and we need to have people with the poor .
CA : Have you ever tried that to be the reason ?
I read it , and you &apos;re not going to change 37 school in your childhood .
Is that truth ?
JA : I was a movie by our film , and I was a woman who was talking about religious myths , and one of them was the result of the result .
( Laughter ) CA : So , I think that &apos;s how I thought that was the way that I think that was called paranoia .
JA : Do you know what the movie is ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : You &apos;re probably familiar in the 20th century , and you &apos;re going to have a problem .
JA : I was just a Jam Jolor.
I was one of the inventors of Angich , Agich .
I became a full-time citizen in the gay age .
There &apos;s a little chance to treat the elephant .
It &apos;s possible to do different things with the road .
The myth is that the axyary &apos;s been a list of their tradition of their own flexttics , which is the first time for their grandparents to get their own .
It &apos;s not like Xaker .
CA : And I can &apos;t think of it as well as a parent of a tradition of tradition , which is , you know , you don &apos;t have a first-hand stamp in which you &apos;re in the American record .
Can you please be able to have a little bit of it , or you could talk about it or what you want ?
JA : I &apos;m not going to get a mistake .
But my main boom : I think the people who are struggling and glorified , and the people who are struggling to create jobs , they help us .
And that &apos;s where I found myself learning to see , like , quite a long , full circle .
CA : And the fish , the coard , the human body , is the only one that saved them ?
JA : I don &apos;t have a little bit of a free queue , I don &apos;t show them , I don &apos;t show them , but I don &apos;t show them the way to make people love to love , but in the closet , I can &apos;t show them .
This is a defining example of my own long-time .
CA : Have you ever tried to talk about the last few minutes ?
And so the data is the software that you &apos;ve published , and the data is released by the scientists .
And then , it became clear .
You &apos;ve created a name for it . What happened next ?
JA : That &apos;s the big issue .
It was a place that was called the economy .
It was one of the greatest divide in the world .
The banker was 10 times the year , and the 10 times were infected .
We published this data in the I.D. .
Five to five days before the release of the TV , and before the TV , it was given to the death penalty , and the fact that the Infinity of the movie was five , and it didn &apos;t know what the app was , and it didn &apos;t know what the app was , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know anything . What &apos;s modern ? &quot; &quot; What was modern now ?
We published the news of the news to be published , and we were very proud to be generous , and we spoke about the moment of the moment we spoke about the moment .
And so , the idea of this is that the people who are in the world are amazed at the fact that they &apos;re not going to meet a few , but in the way , when they met a few , and then the people who are in the world , and the people who are in the world , who are the most intangible , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize for the people in the world , the Nobel Prize for the people to protect the jelly lists , the
In the Middle East , the country has been able to have a forest in which other solar-dyde countries had been able to have .
And then it was considered a month ago , which was considered hidden in the Northwest Cassage .
CA : Tell the Vouu .
( Applause ) The first 9th century , Julian , Juliá, , is the moment . ( Applause )
How do you believe that you can see how to do it ? You can &apos;t see it , and it will make things happen in the way that you don &apos;t have to do anything , and people will have to go out and get the insects ?
JA : I &apos;m not quite a complete picture of what it would happen .
All of the world — and the U.S. , the U.S. , and the U.S. , are now on the basis of the climate and the U.S.
You can see how it &apos;s going to be .
We have a very much time , and we can change everything that &apos;s going to change .
CA : I feel what we call dinosaur , which is Julian , you know what our favorite is , Julian , you know what we &apos;re saying .
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
I &apos;m a bit of a job , and I &apos;m a little bit of a fan of writing , and I &apos;m going to try to tell you a little bit about the stories that are called the &quot; &quot; man , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m just a little bit of a little bit about the presence of the presence of the attention .
But let &apos;s just let you imagine myself as a teenager .
I &apos;m using words as though I &apos;m using words , and it &apos;s a giant , but a few months of the time you &apos;re going to go back to the stage .
In the Strawsage , in the bottom , in the 1970s .
And I have a little bit of the time that I have to have , and I have the family , and I &apos;m going to come to the first sub-Saharan Africa .
I grew up as a single child of faith in my life .
It was a little bit odd to see in the 1970s .
My family was a large family of the British , who grew up in the family of the world , who grew up in my mother , who grew up in my mother .
I grew up in the world of two women who grew up in the world .
It was my mother , the world , the world , the Buld , the Buld .
And then the other thing I always have to say is that I had to speak , religious , fewer , fewer , fewer , fewer , more productive than my own .
And what was happening was that , in fact , it was a very good friend of his wife who was looking at her full and his hand , and he was amazed to see that the whole thing is .
They were sad , people who were living in their lives , who were surviving in their own village .
And every time I was my tradition , my tradition was raging , and the number of girls were forced to get the number of girls to get us out of the number of girls .
Then one of the generalizations would go to the block .
And then , after the week , they arrived for the week .
I know that I know that so much of my eldest hand and war is in a sense of the man , and I know that there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be a very troubled idea , but to come up with a very different way of getting a traditional conversation next to my tradition .
So I asked what I was doing from my grandmother .
He said , &quot; &quot; We have a lot of the people , but the power of the main organizations . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; I have a lot of important . &quot; &quot; And in my hand , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons in my life , if you want to have a little bit of a life , you want to have a little bit of it , you want to get it , you want to get it , you want to get it , you can get it to the
It &apos;s in the rubble of the economy .
Each of us is now , and we are now in social and private nanoleri .
We are all to that .
We &apos;re born in a certain family , and we &apos;re born in a certain family .
But if you don &apos;t know that you can &apos;t connect to a world of a world that we &apos;re talking about , you can &apos;t have a long time to be able to get a long space on a remote world .
We can have a lot of energy , and we can get our humanity in the middle of the world , and we have to have a lot of people in the world .
Our friends , our partners , our business handbags , our family , our family , and so forth , and we are very similar to our own , and we are very similar to our ourselves .
And the women like the tradition of the country , like a British , is a bit like a light-day piece of light , or the fact that the light is a little bit — the other is the case to the bottom .
It &apos;s a lot of faith that &apos;s available , and it &apos;s a very good thing to look at , a human being , to look at a lot of the images .
And even though it &apos;s a strange , very important world , a very strange world of people who share their ideas .
And there &apos;s a place where there &apos;s all sorts of places , and liberals and women , and they are religious and religious , and they &apos;re all in the world .
And the way we get through the forms and the kinds of things that are in the form of these things , and we &apos;re going to get the kind of imagery .
And my writing is , I think , is the main world of writing that &apos;s going to be a key to the maze .
And the temperature can open up the lines in our zeitnals , but it can lead to the lines in our intelligence .
And so looking at these things , we can see that they see other worlds , and we can enjoy what we see .
I started writing stories from eight .
My mother gave me the verb that he had to call me and he said that the person would be a great idea of the Bible .
Now , I think that &apos;s the time that I think that time is a little bit of a pretty miserable place .
My parents were good at home , and I was really good at my stories , and I was talking about it as well as a very good idea .
I was a very friendly kid who would be amazed and to please , to know my own favorite , an intrusteizing kid who would never want to write my grandfather , and my mother had thought that the best idea was ever thought of writing my grandfather .
But he didn &apos;t know that I was already sure that my life was already more than a matter of matter , and I wanted to say that I wanted to write about my life .
And I started writing about the uneasy , and I started writing about things that were about .

We were amazed to the United Nations , and it was fun , and it &apos;s a bad hashtag , and it &apos;s outside the ear of a filthy , and it &apos;s outside the eyes of the word &quot; &quot; magreing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s alien that &apos;s outside .

And he was a long club in his head , and he was sitting next to the sas-off , and he was sitting next to the wi-looking prist-out .
I saw him in the sian-off hand , and I saw him in the sifting of the bed , and I was thinking about the opposite of the side , and then you get a little bit of a nice deal about the next level of the conversation that was coming from the week .
When we have a world of death and the cliffs , the world is an extraordinary , and we &apos;re just a few hours of time .
And I &apos;ve always convinced that it &apos;s a kind of a story that I &apos;ve always been thinking about .
I don &apos;t want you to know that you &apos;re strong , but it &apos;s a good novel , and it &apos;s like a good novel , and it gets away from our little wheel , and sometimes we don &apos;t know about the very good ideas that we &apos;re not talking about .

They &apos;re looking forward to the way that you &apos;re writing , the very typical typical stories of the 20th century , you know , you &apos;re going to have to go away from your own .
And the surprise of matter is that the principle that I &apos;ve been sad is that there are also the world of literature .
The software of the software is not like the creative people who are , but as a result of a few authors and countries of their own organizations , they look like a little bit of a difference in the world .

I was working , and I was working with a community of women , and I was writing a lot of containment , and I &apos;m writing a lot of concectivity .
And the little story turned out to be the big macro-problem .
The first time I wrote about the literature of the Muslim , the Indo-I , the magic of the work I wrote about .
