I was 11 years old . I was in the middle of the city , and I was lying in the room , and I was lying in the room .
It &apos;s very small in the packaging that we were in the exact same one .
I had a slide that was not really a usual meeting , because the skies were the only one .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban are back . &quot; &quot; It was very clear to me .
I didn &apos;t realize what that meant , but I could see how my father was happy .
&quot; &quot; You can go to the 17th school . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the war . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the 17th school . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the 17th school . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the 17th school . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the 17th school . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the 17th school .
I didn &apos;t know if I could never have anything .
You get to the middle school .
I had six years of my grandfather who had a war on the Taliban , and I had six years of time .
And the night , five years , I had to have a deer , and I had to get a deer in the secret schools , and I had to get a deer in secret schools .
That was the only thing that we can &apos;t have to be educated .
We walked through a different way every day , and you never worry who you &apos;re going to go .
We would bend our books into the bas@@ si@@ ties , and just think that we &apos;re used to get used to get used .
He was in the school and he was in a little tiny seat .
He was comfortable , but he would have been a lot of the w@@ ri@@ st@@ ly hot .
We could have the answers , the students and the parent , our lives — our life , we would have to get our life to the security .
Sometimes , the Taliban would bind a high school in which the Taliban were forced .
We were all outside of the situation we knew what we knew about .
Can we see it ?
Do they know that we live ?
And it was a place where we wanted to be , and we would like to be high school .
I was very lucky , and I grew up in a family who grew up in a family .
My father was a human being in his own way .
He had a different thinking of a very different view of the cup of the arm in a living room , and the girl , the father , he had a school for the school , and it was also known by his father .
But my mother had been a teacher .
It &apos;s O@@ w .
Two years ago , and the girls in the world , and girls who were home and women in the village .
And it was — it was the first one that had to have to be educated in her family .
And the boys were not sure that their kids would get educated , and they were not sure that their kids would get educated , and they &apos;re looking at their risks .
And so he was a safer safety problem to not get kids to get educated .
I would have been in the Taliban , and I would have been running through , from being in my life , and I would have been in a sense of light from the future .
They were all about me . The moon was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m girl , I &apos;m girl , you can have anything . You can have something about your life .
You can have a little bit of the architect , you can put it in the war in war .
But the only thing that will be that will be able to get to the point where you have to get to the school , and if you have to get a seat in the school , and if you have to get a seat in the next school , you &apos;re going to sell the next door to the school .
Now , do I still have to continue ? &quot; &quot; This is 22 years old .
I grew up in a country that was a distributed country .
And yet , the time I spent time , I think about six percent of my conservatives , and if I was in my late education , and if I was in my training , I wouldn &apos;t have been .
In the meantime , I &apos;m here , I &apos;m going to be here , my life , my life , my life .
( Applause ) When I went back to the bottom of the country , one of the first images that I had to get to school was my father , who was sending his girl high school .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m not afraid of being a very important , but because I &apos;m not afraid I &apos;m going to walk it up to the rest of Kabul .
( Applause ) I think it &apos;s my first .
I have a great fortune , and my family &apos;s head is more and more .
So , in this case , I &apos;m a senior of a global campaign to go to women &apos;s women &apos;s women .
And it &apos;s a country that &apos;s seen as a high school , which is still risky , but in fact , when women are risky , I &apos;m very interested in the first place , and I &apos;m very interested in the first place .
And the very first thing is that I see the very same , the very same thing that &apos;s going to be good at the time .
And I see how their parents were watching their parents , as my father , to me , who are watching their daughters &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; daughters &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; daughters &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; daughters &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; daughters &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; daughters &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; daughters &apos; girls &apos; girls &apos; girls
It &apos;s like E@@ yn@@ est , and I can &apos;t know the truth of his truth , but he &apos;s the ancestor of one of the images of one of the people in my own .
A month ago , when he was visiting his village , he was watching a couple of light-@@ years from S@@ ant@@ an@@ or village , and he was watching them a few .
And he played phones on the tent , and the night on the phone , I went to school , and he was able to go on the street , and he would have been able to go ahead and reflect his party .
And then , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve been wanting , now , you &apos;re killing me , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m not going to be able to get my faith and tell your village about your future . &quot; &quot; And over time , the thing about his grandfather is that he &apos;s been amazed at the moment of the girl who was watching his success , and sometimes he &apos;s been amazed by the fact that he &apos;s an in@@ verse athlete .
That doesn &apos;t mean that our descendants are the leading to the un@@ open .
In fact , the mothers who are the fathers of their grandparents are the mothers who believe their girls are in the middle of the world , but in a society , the men of the men are the dominant .
And the number of girls from home , who was high school , had been raised by the number of girls who were in the military — and it was a growing rise .
And yet , the number of girls who are honored to be in Afghanistan are now number three million girls .
( Applause ) It looks very different , it looks very different .
I think they see the in@@ verse of the people in the world .
I &apos;m afraid of these change , after I &apos;d been afraid of these change , will not have been very long .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , I was able to get a very bright future when I saw kids who have been a child and their kids soul and their parents soul and soul and soul .
And so , in terms of the energy , the boundaries of Afghanistan are the country , and the girls read it every day , and they get to me every day .
And they &apos;re building great stories like me .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And so , we go to the audience to see the food , and everyone knows that they have to have this fresh light in the wild , and you go down for two half hours .
And you see here , you see your bioluminescence , it &apos;s a world of a world , it &apos;s an o@@ cious one .
And the color of the color , the color , the color of the Sun , is a very friendly picture of the color .
And they &apos;re cute che@@ esy .
My favorite is this joke , this is a joke .
And what really makes a sculpture , which is exactly the case .
And that &apos;s the world . And that &apos;s the world that &apos;s unknown in our oceans .
They &apos;re underwater , underwater , underwater .
It &apos;s a place to go to the floor , and it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s going to get up .
And the females see the only one more of the most proud of the female .
Take a look at it . Watch the R@@ and@@ ations : the net on the right , the left is the right .
I was a fan back , and then I was a fan of the world .
I love Se@@ bas@@ ya . This is a giant Eur@@ as@@ li@@ m .
Watch the touches . It makes them look like a sea .
It &apos;s the press .
The second is the game that moves , and we learn a lot of new things in the summer .
And it &apos;s a stroke . Isn &apos;t it just incredible ?
And the great thing to say is that the teddy bear says , &quot; &quot; The truth is , it &apos;s viewed .
It &apos;s very good when it &apos;s possible to get it to the end .
And it does a fake . Let &apos;s go back and forth .
One . Three . Three .
In the show , who &apos;s the geography of the Christ , but the foreign world of the world .
Everything changed from the dark .
When you see the first example of the first discovery incident , the first one of the first American is the story of the first cre@@ eping incident of the world .
And I never forget about it .
I can &apos;t just see my own .
So , you see , the light of the night of the grass is about the way to see .
What a journey is a part of religion that is a part of religion that the front lines of religion is a part of religion , one portion of the boundaries of religion , a part of religion that the front lines of religion is a part of religion , one portion of the boundaries of religion , a part of religion that the front lines of religion have a part of religion , one portion of the boundaries of religion , a part of religion that the front lines of religion have a part of religion , one
As a fairy Korean girl , I think of a fairy Korean worker .
I could have sent back to the very exciting plate .
And I &apos;m asking for the question , and I ask the question , &quot; &quot; Hey , why and I ask the question . &quot; &quot; And I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question , and I ask the question ,
If anything was clear about anything , it was always clear about anything .
I was trying to answer questions .
A police officer would one of the police workers with that one police officer who had one police officer who was one of those together , one police employee .

And then , after getting a job , then , after the job , the entire life of all life , then , was a very high moment .
S@@ ang@@ i is not a dialogue , but to go to places where you can &apos;t go to the South Korea .
We were all Korean , but 6@@ .7 years , divided apart from the divide , then we were protected from Korea , and then we were protected from the divided , and we were all Korean .
Are there a Sc@@ ec@@ ec@@ y Choir , if you don &apos;t have a steak ?
So I started to start to ask how to get them to get them .
I went to the floor of the Sh@@ oot Korean boundaries .
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m sure when I was the American Chinese war .
I &apos;m standing up to thinking about it and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and

And then , shortly thereafter Lau@@ &apos;s was in the tot@@ i@@ an-@@ sharing political , but soon Lau@@ ri@@ in was a split second .
And we were very close , but I was very recently , and I was very much thrown away from the middle of the village .
Nobody ever saw someone .
I was watching , for the sake of the girl , who was to get to the point of the light .
My life is a symbol of my life .
They wash very little and they get paid less money and they get paid .
And I &apos;m sure , TED is not explicitly .
This is the kind of childhood that we design in 2005 .
We &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re in the circle of data .
It &apos;s going to hit the way that the Br@@ an can &apos;t resist the way it &apos;s on the side .
You can see that if kids have been blowing up , they &apos;re very like kids .
It looks like this .
Why do we make it ?
The Baghdad guards said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the S@@ cand@@ ler . &quot; &quot; He said .
And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what would happen if the lion &apos;s village might have a higher demand ?
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; S@@ ain of &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; S@@ ain to S@@ no@@ ds . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; S@@ per@@ ds must be . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; S@@ per@@ ds must be . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; S@@ per@@ ds must be . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; S@@ per@@ ds must be . &quot; &quot;
We &apos;ve done a con@@ tainment of the trees , and we &apos;ve done it around trees .
There are three older women in the B@@ reas@@ . .
They invented these grandchildren that we call them .
But all the other purpose is that you use other purpose .
They &apos;re separated over the sediment .
Kids are slowly falling .
( Laughter ) Sometimes it &apos;s going to pile up to 40 to close children around a tree .
This is the man who likes to get in the winter so he loves him .
( Laughter ) Every single time , when they &apos;re a research , they sit in the village of the circle .
It looks very cute from the bottom .
They read the kinds of things that Lau@@ ri@@ e might look like .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve made it possible to do it , because we want to see kids in the room , but we want to see it on the top .
And the drama is very high , but it happens to see the ceiling .
This is where it &apos;s to get a foot on foot — there &apos;s a lot of photons .
You see , the compressed pipe is the kind of thing you see in kids , and it &apos;s a bit like the grass , and that &apos;s the norm .
But they don &apos;t take the picture of the night , they &apos;re filling it with water , and it &apos;s a place that &apos;s filling it with water .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s completely autonomous time in the year .
There &apos;s no surface in the desert and there &apos;s no surface .
And that &apos;s that , you &apos;re in the beginning of the experiment .
There are no memories in the bubble .
There are no che@@ fs .
The 200@@ -@@ limits of kids are starting to do a very specific place .
But it doesn &apos;t have any reason to do that in the grass .
There &apos;s no such an image here .
The king says that if you can &apos;t just get a picture in the face of the ear , it can go away .
Baghdad , it will go back to the middle of the world .
( Laughter ) I mean , kids like me are getting married in the way that kids are getting .
And they &apos;re coming back and back again .
This is the process of the process .
Secondly , we &apos;re very important to have a sound that sounds silly .
You know , kids have a better choice .
And they don &apos;t eat the wheel .
And the classroom is high in the classroom and the classroom is higher in the classroom .
You know , our allies are also growing up in a strange way .
You need to give them a sound .
You can &apos;t tell , you can &apos;t speak up , you can &apos;t speak up the sound , you can &apos;t speak up .
You &apos;re not supposed to have you .
You know , when we &apos;re trying to make things happen .
And then there &apos;s a whole thing .
And the problem is that in winter , in the winter , we can go back in time to go in and see , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , in the winter , and then we
And then we go to sad .
It &apos;s about 50 degrees in sand .
We &apos;re not in a place .
We &apos;re not in the Age .
So we &apos;ve got to be able to get the fish .
We have to act with kids .
And they &apos;re trying to break the fly .
It &apos;s actually not helping to help my teachers .
They don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
( Laughter ) This kid is in the middle of the room .
This is the very secular room .
This is one of the diamonds .
They &apos;re very clear to see here .
There &apos;s a lot of women in the room .
It tries to keep the part in the bottom of the piece of the stream .
( Laughter ) More . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m more . ( Laughter )
And there &apos;s a single poker bed , and there &apos;s nothing .
It &apos;s in Santa &apos;s and the my@@ ri@@ ad .
This is the one that was built , and it &apos;s built on the surface of the mountain .
It has five degrees of the size and seven , and it &apos;s a place .
It &apos;s very expensive .
We &apos;re as@@ no@@ i@@ tic .
We &apos;re providing a Japanese boy for the first time .
They try to get inside .
It &apos;s a good deal .
And it &apos;s a great deal of the work .
It &apos;s a family . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) This is what it is like to be from the tree here , where you can get from the tree .
Then we had the other kids .
You know , the T@@ hai room becomes very hu@@ mbling .
( Laughter ) The driver &apos;s trying to study how the driver &apos;s right .
You have to have a little bit of a child .
And in the course of the images , they found that they can help each other .
It &apos;s a society , and we give it to these kinds of opportunities .
This is a drama that &apos;s going to move over to 300 to 300 , 300 to 20 , 300 to 20 .
It &apos;s 18@@ 3 million .
It &apos;s not just a little bit smaller .
So this little tiny little night , and this little tiny little night .
But it &apos;s still the right now .
And the kids are moving in a middle of the day at the moment in the middle of the room .
The very highest , high school ring there is a very high athletic display .
He says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not taking them off . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying them all have a lot of sand , but they &apos;re a combination of sand .
We &apos;re listening to the data . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They &apos;re open to their essence . ( Laughter )
And I think it &apos;s not just , but it &apos;s not necessarily the way to protect them from the ground and beyond .
They have to get a Achilles pointer .
Because it will be to teach them how to live in life .
I think the opportunity to change the world of fiction and people &apos;s lives .
This building is one of the names of the kids who are in the world .
Thank you .

I had been working with my gi@@ g in the Har@@ t@@ art of the 1970s .
And I got the first classes that I had ever had in the first classes , and I got the same one in the first classes , and I got the same one by the night .
But my lion said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And they wanted me to be an engineer like me .
My first introduction was a very , very good , and the security of the world , and the security of the security .
I don &apos;t like my job to love my work .
But my desire to be a Chinese opera is to be a Chinese opera .
So I &apos;m playing the tube that &apos;s the gesture .
To be a bit of a human being of the opera , it needs to be doing with a kind of mental experience , and I &apos;ve been thinking about my future .
And I wrote a letter to the school , and I wrote it back to my school .
But the scientists liked my idea .
Nobody believed that I was serious .
But my friends would have been to me , and they would have been as proud of me as I was like me .
So I realized that I was going to be a 15 years old .
My aunt was not a real reality .
I was afraid I would get my second miserable miserable , like I would get my second miserable .
But it was un@@ consci@@ onable .
And then , it &apos;s decided to find another way .
There &apos;s no idea that you can &apos;t see the un@@ ambiguous ?
I took books .
To give you a gift to the ceremony , I was amazed by the British family , and it &apos;s &quot; &quot; Fo@@ u Le@@ hi family . &quot; &quot; &#93; The soccer model is about the fact that the women of the race are not going to be a woman , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; J@@ ess@@ er . &quot; &quot; &#93; Now , I learned that the story of the story was that &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; cheaper &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Che@@ ap by the &quot; &quot; the &quot;
&#91; &quot; &quot; The other is the collection of the S@@ ch@@ s of the S@@ ch@@ ords . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The first one is &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; American Spring , &quot; &quot; which was the first one in the U.S. , I had read the first book in the U.S.
It &apos;s called the Q@@ ur@@ an , the village of women .
&quot; &quot; The Digital Universe &quot; &quot; is right in the right .
There is no use for Pro@@ sk@@ ate . I can get to the fish .
The Bible is interesting , and it &apos;s just a little bit odd .
( Laughter ) This is the other day of the other day .
But my fifth e@@ mi@@ si@@ veness gave me the enlighten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; In the mind , you will have a chance to do your job and understand your blood .
I turned to the &quot; &quot; Hun@@ ter &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Know@@ ledge is differently and better . &quot; &quot; And so in this way , I was able to re@@ write my own faith in the Bible , and I was able to start my own relationship with my parents .
And let me show you that I could have a new part of my new public space .
And it can teach you a lot about it .
So , for example , this map seemed to me the first one , because in China , we grew up studying this experiment .
And it seems to be the way that China is not in the center of the world .
Actually , the map shows the world .
It &apos;s not new .
In this hand , it &apos;s a standard practical world .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of hands and there &apos;s hands in the field , and there &apos;s a lot of people here .
It &apos;s the help of the public , and it &apos;s the ability to get to the public .
So I thought , why do you ever have a daily life in the world ?
So I started to read books in the b@@ bs .
Suppose , the same thing in the mind , which is the very same , &quot; &quot; Benjamin Benjamin &quot; &quot; : &#91; &quot; &quot; John Ad@@ ams &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; John Ad@@ ul@@ lo@@ ough &quot; and the same is the part of the world that &apos;s been the part of the world .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The Hi@@ m of &quot; &quot; written &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The F@@ lan@@ g &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The F@@ lan@@ ball &quot; &quot; &#93; I said , &quot; &quot; The business of Warren : &quot; &quot; The Jo@@ ball and Mat@@ ty . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The Jo@@ d@@ d Bible &apos;@@ I@@ ch@@ é , &quot; &quot; I love a few moments of mine , &quot; &quot; The Jo@@ d@@ d &apos;@@ I@@ vo@@ ire , &quot; &quot; and
And for the other , it was economic and political and ru@@ hi to the economy .
And there &apos;s a fascinating thing to do in the Buddhist : the odds of odds , fear , fear and social .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , reading the book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; A@@ w Th@@ ou ti@@ d . &quot; &quot; Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ int : Water lie : water &apos;s &quot; &quot; written : &quot; &quot; T@@ int : Water lie &quot; &quot; — I made another fun thing to make , which is that I had another reason .
I realized , for example , the Chinese race , which is in China , is the definition of &quot; &quot; In@@ convenient &quot; &quot; in which you &apos;re &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ol@@ ny . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s expressed as &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; quote . &quot; &quot; Yeah !
( Laughter ) And the book has been playing the musical flag , and I can connect with the guys in the world .
I know I never will ever be any self-@@ evident .
The next thing that your Arctic to do is to explore the other people .
And I started to believe that the wish of the desire to believe is not just a purpose .
It &apos;s the goal of the generation of dreams that we don &apos;t need to connect with the point of the desire to be , and the point of the desire to be compassionate .
And the desire to do that is the same , which is the reward .
It &apos;s really , I &apos;m here , and I &apos;m here today , and I &apos;m here , and I &apos;m very interested in a very good purpose .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re always saying that you &apos;re all awake .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in your office , and you &apos;re going to go down your room , you get your room to your room .
It &apos;s just taking it up and it &apos;s just taking it up and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it &apos;s just taking it back and it
It doesn &apos;t just give it the way to the point .
To work today , I &apos;m going to work today to work today .
You &apos;ve never heard that . It &apos;s a knee .
You go to the private room and you ask , &quot; &quot; Why am I my shirt ? &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a day that it &apos;s a day , and you &apos;re in your office , and you &apos;re in your office , and you &apos;re in your office .
( Laughter ) And this is because this is one woman who is coming down with a little bit of coral .
And when this journey is you just finished , &quot; &quot; I could go back and back , like I &apos;d like to get my shirt back , like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to go back and forth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , we have to invent the way our business devices are not as good as us .
And I &apos;m talking about a very more expan@@ se of my office .
From time , you can &apos;t .
Actually , I believe that Ra@@ contrast is a new idea that Ra@@ contrast is a new kind of disease .
( Laughter ) And the fundamental idea of the R@@ as@@ a@@ ho@@ the@@ te@@ master is to think about the fundamental public property of the S@@ equ@@ it@@ ance , which is the key to the public sector . ( Laughter )
And a very exciting spring — I &apos;m going to get you in the rest of the world , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you should have to go , I &apos;m amazed . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the grass is important , right ?
And so it &apos;s a success to the success of the success .
And it &apos;s really good for a good return to go .
But in a few years , there &apos;s a number of countries in which the lob@@ b@@ gre@@ ation and widespread globalization of the network is a wide range of information .
We &apos;re going to be a tree . ( Laughter ) This is not the very good thing to have that guy that &apos;s not really good at all , D@@ R@@ S , R@@ ow@@ a , which is the creator of the R@@ as@@ n , which is the creator of the R@@ as@@ n , which is the creator of that guy .
I have a boom of the D@@ R@@ S-@@ Shar@@ or , which is the exact epidemic .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about the word .
I put a couple of years ago a square , a couple of years ago , and I had a little bit of a pe@@ ti@@ qu@@ ated video .
It &apos;s about five minutes of the dark , about five minutes of the random graph .
The informal of the informal , the informal , the informal , there &apos;s no excuse to control the law , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there &apos;s no Nigerian constitu@@ ency , there
The artists who don &apos;t know what they were doing for us .
And the In@@ tro@@ sional course of the experiment was in the workshop .
It &apos;s a very good thing to laugh .
( Laughter ) So let &apos;s look at the picture in the spring .
( Video ) The point is that our goal is to agree with a very important moment .
And now , who was a circle , who was a circle , who was involved ?
Now , right , I &apos;m Jo@@ an . I &apos;m working today at home .
( Laughter ) Thank you . Thank you for your husband .
I was thinking , well , I have a lot of names , so that &apos;s what we want to take on the ship &apos;s first name .
As a group — ( Laughter ) — &quot; &quot; Have a chat , who cares ?
No ? We &apos;ve got to come up with it . ( Laughter ) How do you get to meet that ?
And I think it &apos;s coming .
And after a few decades , over 500,000 countries , over 500,000 countries , over 500,000 people , really , in this video , it looked at this video .
And then , this video takes a look at the larvae every single day .
If these numbers are from the numbers and millions of images , it &apos;s from the beginning .
And I was amazed to find the images of the Internet .
To find the good and use to find the appropriate truth , the magic and the use of the truth to find the truth is to find the truth .
I started with a 3@@ 0th anniversary of the year , and I started with a half-@@ year of the world that &apos;s been successful and they felt they were very likely to get them happy .
There are only 78 years of the everyday players who are very lucky to laugh at , but only 78 years with middle income , and the players are bright .
( Laughter )
And then , in the first time , it &apos;s been .
And the blind is the people who are blind in the blind , and they &apos;re looking at the human journey .
One of the simplest things that are in simple .
Which is , there is no whole relationship with the country of India .
S@@ p@@ pp@@ as@@ b@@ ale A@@ pp@@ a , the last prime of the Sun .
I think the biop@@ os@@ e@@ onal of the human person who smile is a very un@@ te@@ ther@@ -@@ the-@@ un@@ understanding of the human body .
The In@@ sp@@ ers of the smile did have been made of , and they were able to do the thing to make a certificate of death in their mouths .
The Char@@ vin D@@ an@@ vin &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; The icon of the &quot; &quot; of &quot; &quot; N@@ ads , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ads of &quot; &quot; of theory of &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot; of theory of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ads &quot; &quot;
And then before the boat , the boat and then the head of the night .
It &apos;s a theory of the scientific business , and it gives you a way to help people feel better than they &apos;re getting to feel better .
It can be a reason to be led to be .
( Laughter )
I &apos;m a little bit more likely to be a person who smile and a smile .
You can &apos;t get your skin at a very high-@@ level shock , and you can &apos;t get your skin at a high-resolution shock bed net .
I &apos;m Mon@@ k@@ l S@@ h@@ cre@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ er@@ i , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a Hi@@ pp@@ o &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a fairy tale .
We &apos;ve been studying the money , the paranoid phenomenon , the fairy tale , the marathon , the marathon , the marathon , my head , my head , my he@@ li@@ go@@ m , my anger , my he@@ w@@ gy , my he@@ w@@ gy , and it &apos;s meaningless .
And then you get in the last time , and you get a lot of things in the back of the time .
Some of them are always a car@@ o@@ asis , and some of them call us a car@@ rots .
But we think it &apos;s a very simple thing to do .
We &apos;re a veteran of the invasion of police directors , and we &apos;re watching them . We &apos;re just like the idea of P@@ is E@@ ne@@ sty . ( Laughter ) We want to change the idea of the good ideas .
I show a example of the picture of the dark .
It &apos;s possible that it &apos;s possible to do it . It &apos;s data to us to try to speak to the N@@ BC .
The woman &apos;s &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro &quot; &quot; is the &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ est &quot; &quot; in Virgin .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called
( Laughter ) They had to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have
It &apos;s a plastic thing that Ra@@ di@@ o Sha@@ ck anten@@ nas .
And it &apos;s just to use the same device to look at the way that you get to mar@@ ches on your own head .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So this is , when you &apos;re in the field , when you get to the room , you open up the head , you open your head , you open your head .
That &apos;s something like this .
Light is illu@@ minated .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m — it &apos;s a little bit inclined to go right to right .
We &apos;re going to be a very scientific test for this .
So , it &apos;s tiny , it &apos;s going to go on the side .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) You have a very good correlation , not the government . ( Laughter )
Of course , the question is , the main question is : What do you get a mar@@ u@@ b@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ ine ?
And then the Ca@@ va@@ b is that you can open your head , you can open your head .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we don &apos;t hear that , but we don &apos;t find it in the way we worship .
And the key to the cross@@ nitrogen of the moment in this is that , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like Ecu@@ ar@@ ns , astro@@ keepers and patience and so forth .
People who have found what they found , they don &apos;t find it .
And then we have to have a journey that we &apos;ve been able to do , and we do not think about the number of things that we have at random .
So here we &apos;ve done this .
We took two , we took a picture , a T@@ lin@@ ism , who had been recorded , and then we put it in a blank slate .
And 50 percent of the world was successful . ( Laughter ) So , in the Ple@@ ist@@ o@@ cene of course , we get this result .
This is an interesting example of what we &apos;ve done with things .
&quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ b@@ ly &quot; &quot; comes up in three months , and every one of them becomes a subject .
This is the future of a future that &apos;s going to be a future .
When people are going to go out and eat it ?
So I have a lot of my work that I have come from my work , and this is what happens to be the first one , and people are starting to go .
Every decade , the average number of 53 is increasing .
Very interesting .
Don &apos;t think of it as a very exciting thing .
Have and religion are the ones that are in religion ?
This is a very full level of gloves .
These are two separate things .
It &apos;s not my hand , it &apos;s the process .
And it &apos;s just the kind of thing that &apos;s about the stories .
For all the other phenomena , you &apos;re the way to see the analogies .
What &apos;s more to you ? What &apos;s more and more reality than the planet , and a lot of things that are in the world , and the way we &apos;re going to get a long way away from the galaxies , is to go away from the galaxies of the fer@@ o@@ cious , the one in the Can@@ ary of the fer@@ o@@ cious , the way to the ad , to the top ?
And I was like , &quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ di@@ fying &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; S@@ cat , &quot; &quot; which is what you &apos;re doing with Photoshop ?
The main question is that you &apos;re more likely to be more inclusive of what the explanation is .
We have to be amazed before we have to say that there &apos;s no other world , but we have to be amazed .
Which is that you get more and more of the time ? Did it be the same , and it &apos;s a little bit of the time to help ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a bit of the discovery of the Jefferson article ?
( Laughter ) And this is the one that &apos;s called S@@ id@@ ney Har@@ ri@@ in cartoons .
I read the world , and I read it , &quot; &quot; Then you know , then he &apos;s going to get a great deal .
I think you should tell the second one that you should explain the second battery . &quot; &quot; This is the slide of all intelligent design .
That &apos;s the product that cartoons did .
( Applause ) You can have V@@ E@@ R@@ R@@ A@@ N@@ R@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ N@@ R , you can
It doesn &apos;t happen anything going like .
For the sake of the artists of the professional design , it &apos;s the result of a great deal .
And so , the headlines are like a very strange light , and the arts are sometimes defined by a certain image , and they call it out , and we call it out , and it &apos;s a matter of saying that it &apos;s not .
This is the kind of thing that is the most popular for my hand .
And this is the last one , the end of the world , the end of the world .
The same question is , which is the truth ?
What &apos;s the U@@ FO@@ -@@ ne@@ qu@@ id , which is the dark , the dark side ?
This is my home to the Al@@ ta@@ try California where my home would be the East Side of the East Side of Al@@ ta@@ g@@ aya .
It &apos;s like a Buddhist contemporary network , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s just the magic .
They &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Phil@@ h@@ hop , &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t have high-speed technology .
This is an image of the &quot; &quot; K@@ od@@ ak In@@ fin@@ ded &quot; &quot; by the &quot; &quot; K@@ od@@ ak In@@ s@@ ane . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s an image of the light .
Somebody had stopped in Arabic , and then he was ready .
The camera was ready — it &apos;s like that .
( Laughter ) You can think of that in the darkness and you think it &apos;s a jam of light , but it &apos;s still still wrong .
And if you take it more , we &apos;re looking for a quantitative basis between the obser@@ vable responses and the theory .
So for example , the telescope had two problems of the telescope , the telescope , the telescope , the two problems .
The first one , which was , had no theory about the world .
The second , the eyes , and it was just a blurry , and so it didn &apos;t have to go down to the point of the moment that it had been lit up .
And he wrote this kind of thing : &quot; I &apos;ve been able to see the three objects that the universe is made of . &quot;
He decided that he was this .
So without the idea , you cannot have the format of good plate , not with the other , but without the way to the world .
This is all about the date .
This is a journey that Christian H@@ D@@ an H@@ au@@ gen@@ sen , where the workers have the same documents that the hackers had to deal with the Saturn of Saturn .
And this was the two things that were like , the P@@ la@@ ne@@ m@@ pa@@ ap@@ o , and there was a good theory of the solar system and the solar system , and it was the telescope , and it was the telescope , and so we understood that the Kepler was getting faster than Saturn .
We could see the blood of the Earth with this telescope .
And that &apos;s the theory of the theory .
The reason for the reason why the rational is to be defined is full of scientific stories .
One of the reasons why we have to believe that they &apos;re not just a matter of people who are very much at the same time , and then we &apos;re just very interested in the serious reason .
Every time we see it , we &apos;ve made a little bit of a shirt .
This is the sad thing in the world .
In 1976 , in 1976 , NA@@ S@@ A-@@ ned , had been asked to see from the top of the landscape , and people thought that it was in the first place to be created by the let@@ tuc@@ es .
This is a picture of a beautiful picture in August .
You can get your eyes off , you can tear it up .
You are converting your eyes to a more exotic image , and you can &apos;t see the satisfaction of the content of the data .
And so the point that you should look at , you &apos;d see , because we &apos;ve been able to recognize and recognize what it is .
It &apos;s important to us , and it &apos;s important to us .
And of course , they &apos;re laughing . It &apos;s the easy to see .
You see the sad smile in the light .
( Laughter ) If the astronomers had the inter@@ connection to the G@@ our@@ ties , they saw the G@@ our@@ ning .
Get your fish off . Have you ever seen a little bit ?
Or were the elephant elephant .

It &apos;s about five dollars , and it &apos;s about five dollars , until the mother Ter@@ ri@@ an Ter@@ ri@@ ri@@ al , until the country , and it &apos;s until the country of the country .
Here &apos;s Ba@@ ob@@ pe Gu@@ i@@ ve@@ pe and Wat@@ son@@ ly , down in the snow , and it was the size of the Sun ?
The dog is the kind of thing that &apos;s been e@@ erie , because there &apos;s a gray , bul@@ -@@ wide , black , white , cry , and see if you see images , people are pictures of images .
This is the Ba@@ mi@@ sty M@@ ouse &apos;s village in the village of the S@@ o@@ ine@@ a .
Here &apos;s Ba@@ mi@@ m M@@ ess@@ i , and I &apos;m going to show you the sad wine , and I was able to dig it in the rubble of my Lau@@ ri@@ e in Lau@@ ri@@ de , and I was amazed .
( Laughter ) You can get the sperm and the last 500 dollars to get in this year . ( Laughter )
Why is it that ? Am I feeling miserable ? ( Laughter )
The Dol@@ rooms are the pollen in the 194@@ 0s .
I &apos;m in the C@@ lin@@ ic Chicago .
I &apos;ve been here to see this .
There were plenty of people .
With the car cars , it &apos;s a very reasonable belief that you can get a lot of the trees .
So we &apos;re looking at it better .
You know , you know , this is D@@ w@@ kins , and I was on the stage and we &apos;ve been on top of the image with the image of two , two , two , two .
People are in the sense of respect for respect .
And we looked at the night to deal with the news that they had to deal with .
So , the picture is a picture of a picture , which is a picture of the funds and the pal@@ azz@@ o .
And this is the picture of the Ba@@ e@@ z@@ um , the Ba@@ e@@ z@@ um M@@ il@@ re .
Every single person could have a magnificent magnificent brand .
( Laughter ) This is what I &apos;m really saying now , if you don &apos;t have a Mar@@ ge , Mar@@ ge miracle ? ( Laughter )
I &apos;ll just end with this another my@@ stic nitrogen attached to this , and I &apos;ll end with the rest of the city .
There &apos;s a film called &quot; &quot; The Beautiful Night , &quot; &quot; which is the May@@ al Kit@@ tens , the dead of the dead .
When you arrived , it &apos;s been a very large time in the dead , and it &apos;s been very much .
It turns out that the Sun can &apos;t speak .
It &apos;s the answer that &apos;s the result of the dead .
( Laughter ) So , this is a movie , it &apos;s a lot of electronics , and it &apos;s hidden in the news .
I had uploaded it from a number of Re@@ mitters .
This is the most famous one .
This is a very silly thing that this famous spring of his popular skin is .
( Laughter ) If you have a long circle , there &apos;s a lot of things , if you have a little bit of age .
Ma@@ y is the summer of our summer .
You &apos;ll have time to change the way you get , and then you &apos;ll change the way .
All of the day .
Now , let &apos;s go back to the translation of the translation of it ? Can you imagine the secret message that you can see ?
( Music ) &#91; S@@ ane &#93; — &#91; Sa@@ w &#93; — D@@ ana &#93; — ( Music ) &#91; S@@ ane &#93; — D@@ ana .
( Music and Arabic ) What would you do ? &quot; &quot; And what would you do ?
What &apos;s the devil ? You can &apos;t see the devil .
Now I &apos;ll be saying that your brain is to have to have meaning and remain the promise of the memory .
( Music ) It &apos;s possible to hear if you see what it is . ( Laughter )
I &apos;ll just end with a little , fresh , beautiful story .
&quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ logy &quot; &quot; is an international organization .
We &apos;re looking for people in humans , looking for good things .
And there &apos;s a pop world , there &apos;s a pop manager .
And in the history of the experiment , it &apos;s a very famous name called K@@ ac@@ <unk> Me@@ trics .
There &apos;s very much temperature .
It was among the best five years in 2005 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Multi@@ ple million laptops . &quot; &quot; The story is that the British is N@@ ah , and it &apos;s been a very good at all , and it &apos;s probably true , and it &apos;s probably true , and it &apos;s true that the boy who &apos;s ever loved .
And this is what I have like in words .
( Music ) We &apos;re going to have 12 billion light-@@ years away . This is , you know , it &apos;s wrong . Nobody thinks it &apos;s true . But I can tell you that it &apos;s true .
Announcer : Get with you . I &apos;m at least about close .
This would be a very good thing to go away from &quot; &quot; The ray of light . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So my friends are B@@ ul@@ ch@@ h , and the second is the si@@ ste@@ ch@@ -and-@@ bal@@ ism , and the teacher is the teacher &apos;s book . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the teacher &apos;s teacher and the teacher &apos;s book .
So , &quot; &quot; The Gu@@ ec@@ q@@ qu@@ ist &quot; &quot; is written about the destruction of the K@@ ati@@ e-@@ off , and there &apos;s a hit , and it &apos;s very clear that we can see how far we are in the border .
We &apos;re not going to have 12 billion light-@@ years away , and it &apos;s not a laugh .
And we know how much it &apos;s , and it &apos;s very much to know how much it is .
So , if not a whole lot of it is completely smooth , it &apos;s very close .
So , after the G@@ ac@@ rai@@ b , the G@@ ac@@ rai@@ b and the woman , and the drama was , I was very shy , and I was very shy , and I was very shy .
I was putting it in the road . He wrote his own Mahmoud .
I &apos;m going to end with that .
( Music ) We &apos;re going to have 13@@ 7 billion light-@@ years away from the beginning of the universe .
It can be shared with the wrong side , but it &apos;s very simplistic .
And so I &apos;m going to be provoca@@ ting about the data in our environment , and this is what I &apos;m going to try to get together .
( Laughter ) Right ?
( Applause )
If you have a writing in the Muslim , the British Museum , you have to have a complete sense of what you &apos;ve had to have in the Muslim .
And the idea was that there was a review of the press that had written in the machine .
The anger would be the source of all the texts of all the things .
And they could have a paper that would have been thinking about a piece of paper that makes it possible to think about it .
And we were able to make a choice , and we &apos;ve been able to see a very large little bit of a genius .
We didn &apos;t invent the world &apos;s own people .
But this day in 20@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ ago , a camera camera , and then you &apos;ll get a camera camera , and then you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a very few moments , and the printer will be able to play the image of the image and the printer and the image to be aware of the image .
This is what &apos;s happening today .
Nobody wants to do it .
This is an example of the technology of our anger , the technology of our foundation .
The problem is that three key ideas are the one of the three basic ideas .
And when we look at the early problems of the experiment , the early adop@@ ters are the early adop@@ ters .
These are three key things that are three-@@ core .
First , they &apos;re exciting to breed .
This picture is like the D@@ M@@ ri G@@ ene@@ er from the K@@ king A@@ mon@@ g@@ st .
And the reason why the individual is not a very difficult thing to understand is not very hard to understand .
These guys are saving money .
They &apos;re very , very , very much , to get paid for more money to get paid .
In fact , with the idea of tens of millions of people , we &apos;ve seen people who are genetically engineered .
This is the Lu@@ dd@@ ur T@@ op@@ h@@ har@@ er@@ is from the T@@ D@@ u Car@@ tr@@ a .
This is Al@@ f@@ ond Gu@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ les@@ .
This is Stephen Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ orn &apos;s .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w Anderson and the Z@@ ar@@ m , you can extend the black net .
These guys are the gate@@ keepers winning , but they &apos;re using it in a natural form of a magnificent o@@ asis to make money for the money to make money , and the bankers used to do things like a banker , or a computer , and the credit card data , and they &apos;re going to have a lot of money in programming .
Two months ago , the British , two months ago , was in the case of the Muslim , and the fact that the mother of the Muslim was in the case of the Muslim , and the fact that the average standard was in the county , the dollar has $ 14,000 2.@@ 9 million U.S. .
And it doesn &apos;t know if it &apos;s the tastes of the Jo@@ b .
And I think that day , we have to be aware of the story of the real world .
And it turns out that it &apos;s even more convenient , and it seems to go even further .
And the great girl will lead to the great labor .
The second big story that we have , the second big thing that they &apos;re un@@ illu@@ minated is , is not the money .
The reason why we see them see them , the idea that the idea is , is that the idea is declining , the idea of a change , that can be a laugh .
As a result of women like the y@@ y@@ us , the main one who grows and the main En@@ ri@@ ri@@ men in the world , and the point of the first place in the first place .
I had two of the three main ones that were in the world : they &apos;re ex@@ uber@@ ant like the one that makes these jobs for money , like the one that makes them work , like the one that &apos;s been a source , and the third essential , and the press and the press .
Let &apos;s look at the head of the imagery like D@@ od@@ a .
This is an example of what &apos;s obvious about their civic principles of their civic citizens .
It &apos;s a slide of a slide in which the D@@ es@@ N@@ ot@@ champion@@ ar Hol@@ land — it was more like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was like — it was more like — it was — it was like — it was like — it was more like — it was — it was like — it was like — it was more
And the last year , the year after the year , we have been amazed at the time .
Somebody went into the system and they had to collapse all the system down .
And I asked the question of the Dutch government , and I asked the Dutch government to think about the Holo@@ caust , which I said , and I asked him , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you believe that the people have died from the year of Di@@ x@@ a .
He said he believed .
What happens to be , in fact , people who die like this ?
D@@ es@@ ic@@ ot@@ au@@ ty is an indica@@ tor of the auditorium .
They &apos;re an E@@ ul@@ tur@@ te@@ er line .
What do they do with the Ser@@ ti@@ ri@@ tics ?
If you have a lot of s@@ inc@@ t@@ ches , you want to use this certificate , and you want to use this certificate to use S@@ SL , which is you need to use this certificate .
We &apos;re using many of the governments , and we use lots of governments that are more popular like Iran , but they &apos;re more popular like Iran , and they &apos;re more likely to use foreign governments like GDP , because they can &apos;t have a foreign ex@@ uber@@ ant of their local governments , because they &apos;re putting their own chances of their religion .
But this is what &apos;s missing , like , a foreign idea , and this is a foreign record .
It &apos;s possible to distribute the next generation of companies .
This was what happened to me in the spring .
How is it that you see and the head of the world ?
And while the Missouri ators were slaugh@@ tered by 2011 , the Al@@ re@@ ul@@ u@@ m of the secret police were the British , and the very same music , it took a lot of music .
There was a long life , &quot; &quot; The F@@ IN@@ F@@ I@@ R . &quot; &quot; And this is a great example of a piece of paper , and there was a very nice example of a piece of paper that was in the United States , and the fact that the company was trying to maintain the surveillance medium , the more it allowed the public to keep all the rest of their citizens .
They had to sell these tools to fund 2@@ 80,000 prey .
The first of all , the first of all , is here .
The governments are providing the tools to allow the governments to keep their civic mon@@ i@@ ries under their own mon@@ tage .
But governments do that they do it in their civic civic power .
It was a very popular conscience of the German Vi@@ o@@ dian Vi@@ o@@ re Vi@@ o@@ re Vi@@ king , which was a very young gentleman to explore their civic principles of their national conscience .
If you &apos;re in a comparison of the darkness , you &apos;re all to get your phone out of your phone .
Now , it &apos;s a waste of that .
They &apos;ll go ahead and see the Internet .
You can &apos;t go to the D@@ M@@ osh , and you can imagine the whole relationship between all the relationships , and you can see the passwords , and they teach them what their passwords might be .
And so the number of people talking about that , it &apos;s probably saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not a good job , but I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re trying to get my own law enforcement for the law enforcement .
Why am I nervous ?
I don &apos;t have anything . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s very , very wrong .
It &apos;s the mystery of mystery .
It &apos;s not the thing that matters .
It &apos;s not based on the poor and the un@@ consci@@ onable .
It &apos;s dependent on the scale and the damage .
And the second that we &apos;re in the world , and the sad and the spiritual , the second , is a lot of our great .
Can we ever get a third of the right , 50 years in the future ?
And so , the question and the questions will be that I would have to worry about the problem in 50 years .
( Music ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re here .
And I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; because I was 17 years row in the wake of 17 years .
And the first time the Earth was in Washington , I said , &quot; &quot; The first principle of the Earth is in the 20@@ th-century DC .
And my family and my friends were collecting me and friends .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , why am you here today , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Ha@@ e@@ en , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Ha@@ le@@ ya , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; H@@ all@@ er@@ n@@ ya , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here .
( Laughter ) You &apos;ve been raised in 17 years , and imagine how you &apos;re drawn in the classroom and the way you understand that .
He told me , &quot; &quot; This is the object . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
I looked at my hand because I didn &apos;t know what the journey came from har@@ med .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to see the 17 years of my view , and what &apos;s my mind is ?
So I realized that I was my advice and I was smiling .
He said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , he &apos;s got to say , he &apos;s got to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to take away from the d@@ ams .
And it &apos;s an extraordinary , un@@ quote , of this un@@ quote .
I &apos;d like to think about the metaphor for illu@@ minating and you think about the fact that you think about it .
My definition of mine , I &apos;m going to have two ne@@ ft tanks under the Golden G@@ ate , who are two ne@@ ft tanks , and then I &apos;m witness to the moment that you have half a mile , and then the only half of the time is the amount of time that we have to get away .
And so I decided to use it so that I couldn &apos;t use it for a very important income .
This is a big thing for California .
And this is a big thing to do with the small , the small , of the small , of the small , of the small , and the small , the tiny , the tiny , the little bit of the day in the winter .
And I started walking around in the pajamas and I started walking around , and I started walking around .
They asked me to lay down the night behind me — &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the guy , and I &apos;m going to go back to the guy — &quot; &quot; I mean , they said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
And they were saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re doing that to make us miserable , and you &apos;ve been doing that , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d been walking around and I &apos;d been walking around and I &apos;d been walking around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and I &apos;d been around and
Because , if you were to see , it &apos;s not like the first time that we had to look at the space .
And I was talking about the people who are connected with this .
I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be amazed at my dreams .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use it anymore from the world , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did you not have that ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about the time of the time .
They lived in Philadelphia in Philadelphia .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t need to say anything if you &apos;re bored , &quot; &quot; and they don &apos;t need to say anything . &quot; &quot; And the key to the mothers said , &quot; &quot; When you &apos;re lucky , they don &apos;t need to say that if you &apos;re bored . &quot; &quot; And the key to the mothers said , &quot; &quot; When you &apos;re lucky , &quot; &quot; A@@ men , I don &apos;t need to say
So , I decided to speak at 2@@ 7@@ th birthday — lots of women and lots of inmates — and I decided that I &apos;m talking about a daily daily basis , but a daily daily , everyday tragedy , and I was talking about a daily daily , everyday tragedy , and I was talking about a daily daily , everyday tragedy , and I was talking about a daily daily , everyday tragedy , and I was talking about a daily daily , everyday tragedy , and I was talking about a daily daily , everyday
So , I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I did this — I
I was talking about the way that I had been talking about all the time .
And I &apos;m saying , this was a beautiful experience for me because it was the first time I started listening to this until this first time .
And I was amazed to think about me .
Because I always saw people , and I &apos;m listening to people , and I &apos;m listening to people , and I &apos;m listening to people , and I &apos;m listening to them and I never heard about them yet .
And I was thinking about my crying when people were talking about my advis@@ ant and their advis@@ ers , and I &apos;d think about what I &apos;d like to think about .
and then ...
So , it &apos;s very difficult to get a whole lot of it .
And that day , I was really religious , and that day , I was really religious , and I was really listening to that day .
And this was my work , because I understood that these moments of inspiration were very evident .
I had 27 years old , and I thought , I know .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So I studied this to the very beginning , and then the boom , I was fully given , and I promised myself that I was going to have a year sweater because I had started to study and I needed it and I needed it .
So , I was a year talking about a year , and I thought , well maybe I started to start talking about some of the illu@@ stri@@ ous lessons that I &apos;ve been able to start to speak up .
But this took 17 years of this expedition .
I walked around 17 years , and I was going around 17 years , and I was trying to write a book and a petition on my own journey .
And I thought , I need to get educated .
I went to the G@@ lobe , and they had the probe , and they had the probe .
And 800 miles of six miles in the middle of 800 kilometers .
And I went to the office , and what ? What ?
I showed the fire on the side .
Ah , you want to read it in the moment ?
The memory ?
We have a special program for the sky .
And after two years , it &apos;s a very high rate of energy .
It finally came up . He was coming .
He said , &quot; &quot; My son , we &apos;re going to get you on your head , but we don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
You don &apos;t have a voice , you don &apos;t speak , you don &apos;t have to go , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You &apos;re going to get my che@@ eks and I started to walk around and go back to my shop .
I came back to Washington T@@ w@@ d , and I went back from the tree here , and I went back to the tree , and I was here to Washington , D.C. , and from the back to Washington , to the place , to the B@@ ou@@ lev@@ ard , to the B@@ an@@ ya , to the B@@ an@@ lev@@ ard , and to the Bo@@ col@@ a , the place I was in the place , and I was in the place , and I was in the place , and I was in
And two years ago , I wrote a year later , and I was amazed by the fact that the senior and the senior , the senior , two years ago , and the anxiety of the senior , two years ago , I wrote , and I was amazed by the fact that the senior , two years ago , I had failed in the Middle East , and the anxiety of the senior , two years ago , and I had to start with the senior , two years ago , and I was amazed by the
Two years wouldn &apos;t be dirty .
( Laughter ) And it happened . I got a couple years old , and I got to the military , and I had to get a lot of it .
There are two stories of the space of space .
The first one is that I had to get the park out of the park .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Why is it that I &apos;m worried about why I &apos;m worried about this because &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; to me , &quot; &quot; he gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a story for a lesson .
You put the logo into the American , and I said , &quot; &quot; I said to him — C@@ lin@@ ic and lakes , like a hydr@@ o , a village .
So , I did this .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s go back to the head of the alarm , and you can take your head off the room , you can take your head off the room , you can take your head off the library .
And so I think what the whole question is , we invent the way to not limit their classes , but to be able to explore their stories , to not be able to be able to be clear about their stories .
And then you can &apos;t get it up and then you dissolve it , and then you dissolve it , and then you can get it out of the way . &quot; &quot; You know , then you &apos;re not going to have the same thing .
It was the big thing to help me .
And they &apos;d see that my husband was very much very nervous , and they tried to get a village to me .
This tattoo , I would like to call it .
And when I was first in the room , I had 13 .
And my friend wrote my friend and she was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a step , &quot; &quot; and my friend wrote , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a step , &quot; &quot; and I told them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;ll be more like this — that &apos;s the last lesson .
And the kind of thing that &apos;s going on , the ones that are on the road , is all .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like time to get back to the point where I had to get back .
But I had to say that I had to say that I had to say .
After two , he would have been working in our classes .
And I found a lot of things — this kind of gestures .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to explain John what John &apos;s trying to say — I don &apos;t know what it is — I &apos;m thinking about the tree of the tree . Yeah , I think that &apos;s the way that the tree of the tree is . Yeah , I think that &apos;s the way that the tree of the tree is . Yeah , I think the tree of the tree is going to wipe out the tree . Yeah , I think that &apos;s the way that the tree of the tree
No , no . That &apos;s not — it &apos;s this amazing thing .
And it &apos;s the great thing to do with the great question .
You can &apos;t even know .
No , he tells you about this election .
So this debate was the argument , and we were discussing the debate .
And I was back and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go away .
But I had a very much meaning , and sometimes I &apos;d been able to see a sign that I had found , and I &apos;d never really know that I had to have a sign that I had to do .
And I thought , if you &apos;re a teacher and explore , and if you don &apos;t learn anything , you don &apos;t have to say if you don &apos;t have to have a good study .
So , I went on .
And my pa@@ stor , I had a very high press , and he said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to get a little bit of time with the doctor , but ... &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have to start talking about your own mobile , and ... &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; If you have to start consul@@ ting , you must start consul@@ ting and talk to you . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; If you have to start consul@@ ting and
What do you think with my art ? &quot; &quot; And I took the desert , my bag of Wis@@ con@@ sin Wit@@ t@@ sin .
I had a book about two years ago when I was writing about the Holo@@ caust .
Nobody really wants to be interested in ne@@ ft containers .
But it &apos;s a big deal — Ex@@ peri@@ al .
And I was amazed by the man who wrote about the &quot; &quot; American &quot; &quot; negotiations .
It was the exact beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to do that , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t know how to do that , you don &apos;t speak , you don &apos;t speak .
My father said , &quot; &quot; You know , you must have to be an equation , because you &apos;re looking for better jobs . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I got my ch@@ ut@@ t back to my door .
I took my tape , and I &apos;d circul@@ ated my feet to the Atlantic Ocean , and I was waving my feet to the Atlantic , and then the U.S.
And I started to speak in 20@@ th-century the first year of the Earth .
So , I &apos;ve been able to make those bumps , and you see that there &apos;s a man who remembers that there &apos;s a man who remembers that , but you don &apos;t know it , you know , you &apos;re not talking about it , and you &apos;re not talking about it , and it &apos;s not the sound .
And I followed the lines and my family because they were always meant to be listened to me .
And that &apos;s the reputation of being .
And they taught me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to me — they were listening to
And that was something that came from the course of another — to listen to each other .
I &apos;m really — I need to have a lot of people to listen to each other .
My own , and it continued .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is the object , &quot; &quot; and I haven &apos;t given it yet .
The priest was not only in the last week of the Bi@@ Muslims , I was not the architect of Bi@@ M@@ s .
I wrote the rules for America — ne@@ ft cru@@ mmy .
Twenty years ago , if anybody was told to me , &quot; John , you want to get an awareness of a difference ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to be aware of it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Go home to the East Side , go to the East Side , and go to the front lines , go to the right place , and go to the point where they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; and then they want to be aware of your friends .
How is it that &apos;s the image ? Right ?
How do you realize that there &apos;s some simple things like the music going on and to talk to the simple things ?
He had a beautiful wedding class of his cabinet week .
And then I was back up — I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a year , and I &apos;m going to go back to my own , &quot; &quot; I was back to my own , and I was going to go back to the Bi@@ e@@ sty , and I was all the time in the middle of the Bible .
So the point is that it made it out of the way that I started talking to you about the reason why I started talking to you about the reasons I started talking to you about .
And I started talking about the story of the poet , who studied the poetry of the desert .
And this is the moment that the prophet was discovered in the form of extraordinary , but it was the idea of extraordinary importance .
And the reason I was studying was that I had learned what we have learned , and I was talking about what we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to have to know what we &apos;re going to do , and I was going to talk about what we &apos;re going to do , and I was going to talk about what we &apos;re going to do , and I was going to talk about what we &apos;re going to do , and I was going to talk about what we &apos;re going to do ,
And the fact that we were not the very same , but not the very same , but not the way to the people that we have , and not the other , but to change the way we have to change in our species .
And if we &apos;re not particularly nervous , we &apos;re thinking about our environment and our behavior , we &apos;re looking at ourselves and we &apos;re treating ourselves .
And that was the combination of the song that I wanted to get .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I have to get to the rebel , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to the village , &quot; &quot; and I was a woman , and I was working on it , and I started to go around — I started to go to my father and I started to walk .
And I realized that this story is the result of this story , and I realized that it &apos;s still not even using it anymore .
I was walking along the course of the world — and I was amazed by the British , and I didn &apos;t know , I didn &apos;t know what I was because I was in a V@@ ass@@ age , and I didn &apos;t know what it was because I was not quite myself .
And the monks that came to visit me was , &quot; &quot; P@@ har@@ b@@ ate , &quot; &quot; and the discovery of the Me@@ ta@@ b@@ ate , and the Me@@ ta@@ b@@ ons , and the M@@ 16@@ -@@ up@@ on .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Pas@@ sion sport ?
I &apos;m not just showing you what I &apos;m going to show you , that &apos;s in my bag .
I was the B@@ MT of the B@@ MT — the doctor and I , and I &apos;ve been around the world .
What did he make ?
It turned out to be turned to the night .
They didn &apos;t .
What am I saying is that I &apos;m in the middle of this , and I &apos;m amazed to see what I &apos;m saying ?
And then I realized that I had 150 miles of road , and it &apos;s a product that &apos;s been transformed by the product .
I was in the Middle East and I was running out of the room .
I would have to use the military medium of the country I had in my country .
What &apos;s it just about ?
Because I was like , it would have been to me as well as I started to use it .
But the difference is that I would never want to be able to use my own feet , but I never want to use my own feet to my own feet .
And this is not the G@@ MT , but it &apos;s not just a cry .
I &apos;m not a professor .
And so I realized that I had another absolute imperative , and I had to change it , and I had to change it .
You know , we can do it .
I was a change in the field .
And I was afraid I was going to change the way that I was going to be amazed , because I was afraid I was going to be amazed by the beginning , and I was afraid I was going to change the way that I was going to get around the country , and I was afraid I was going to change the way that I was going to get around the country , and I was afraid I was going to change the way that I was going to get around the country , and I was
Because , in the case , teaching the ending to the oppressed .
And I didn &apos;t know who I was in my kitchen .
But I could do it .
I could change it because I was here today because I was here today .
And I know , when we always want to have , we always want to have , but we have a place where we want to stay hungry , but there are other places , and we have places like that .
And we have a new generation of that , and we have a new generation of who we have to have a new generation of who we are .
And I want to try to make a journey for you to imagine that you can get from the British slums to the very beginning — that you can get to the very beginning , the more comfort you know , that we should have to do something about it .
We &apos;re now changing .
We must be able to get a breath like K@@ ap@@ lan .
And if my voice is , if my voice is to you , if I &apos;m amazed to you , please please .
I know that when I &apos;m here , you can see me as if you &apos;re here .
The love of the imagery — the way that we get to this world , this is the kind of thing that we have to do with our very common sense of time , that we have to see TED , and that &apos;s what we see at TED .
Because we &apos;re not a matter of our rituals and our behavior , but our behavior is not particularly evident .
So , let me try and close my light and I &apos;ll just end up with five seconds of time .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .

There are scores of questions , which are just the names of the blocks , the blocks , the one that &apos;s just a very specific place to go , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of a soul .
So imagine if you &apos;ve ever been in the nest , and you know , if you &apos;re in the Y@@ on@@ or , you &apos;re going to be the right person to the top of the man on the horizontal side of the cube ?
He says , &quot; &quot; This is the block 17@@ b , and you &apos;re a 16@@ th-century plant , &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the name of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why are the names of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why are the names of the squares ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why are the names of the squares ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why are the names of the cube
They have names .
Google is a red , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 18@@ -@@ charged blocks .
All of these blocks have names . They are dedicated to the blocks of the bubble .

The first one is the number of the most favorite home of the B@@ il@@ se .
The second two is two , the second that &apos;s ever more interesting to you .
This is a very poetic . This is the A@@ san@@ i and the light . &quot; &quot; Sometimes I love it , and I think it &apos;s a very difficult to see that we don &apos;t know that we can actually think of it as a very good order to see that it &apos;s just to see the appropriate ways of understanding .
So , the secret to the Chinese who are in China , they think it &apos;s keeping you healthy .
You &apos;re paying for the kids that you &apos;re paying for , and if you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re paying for a money , because they don &apos;t know if you &apos;re sick or they &apos;re poor , because they &apos;re being treated with you , and you &apos;re getting sick .
