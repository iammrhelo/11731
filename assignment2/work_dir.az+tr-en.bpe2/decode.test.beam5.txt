I &apos;m going to talk today about invisible exploration .
So I &apos;m working in the solar technology .
And my little bit of light is coming into the power of power , and then ...
So let &apos;s look at different mirrors .
This is just a little video about what we &apos;re doing .
A .
It can be a little bit higher .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) We just — this part of the piece — my part of the piece of the piece — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s my part of the piece . ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not . ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The magic technology .
Oh , what was time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
I &apos;d like to urge you to see what you see .
So , after a few minutes , let &apos;s go back to this , and I hope that if you can &apos;t forget that , you know , it &apos;s very important to realize that if you can &apos;t forget your life .
We &apos;re very interested in language , particularly in particular , the other way of interacting with their language .
The different memes are different , ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s a very simple thing to do , and it &apos;s something simple .
Narrator : They get to the 10 neutral house .
This is the lucky policeman of America .
And the head is miserable — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to fall away . We consume ourselves .
We &apos;re inside .
We &apos;re invisible to the guy in the world .
As you can see , there &apos;s animals and people are the same .
And it turns out that there &apos;s no power and strength in this .
And then we tend to be able to complete their gestures that we tend to do .
So , if you &apos;re willing to pile up against us , then we &apos;re trying to pile up , we &apos;re trying to pile up .
In contrast , we become the glue .
Do you know what it looks like ?
And I found that there &apos;s a lot of popular gestures in the Great Wall .
They &apos;re talking about the Infinity leader , and when they go into the classroom , they live in the dark straight straight into the middle of the world .
They &apos;re sitting in the middle of a small , two and a half .
And they lay in this translation .
They &apos;re invisible .
They &apos;re angry like they &apos;re sitting , and they lay their hands .
I was just a few answers .
The first is you will not be surprised .
And then , it &apos;s very dependent on sexual .
So the women are often more likely to get to this law .
Girls often feel more hopeful than men , and that &apos;s not the result .
And it &apos;s a place where there &apos;s no matter .
And it &apos;s very important for the MBA , because they are self-evident in their classroom .
We have to recognize that our schools are often at the same time .
And the person who is ready to prepare , and the women at the end of the women are coming up in the end of the world , and it seems to be connected with it .
I started thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve started to think of myself , that &apos;s more active in the winter .
And if you want to take these videos , they &apos;re just going to be able to get more active and more active at the time ?
And if we were able to do it very much , it wouldn &apos;t have existed .
So if we can make it strong , we can feel much more powerful within our behavior , that we can feel more powerful than the outcome of our behavior ?
And then we know that our joggers and our uncles and our aunts liked their way to think about us .
But the question that inspires us is that it doesn &apos;t really have to do it , and that &apos;s what we do .
But then we &apos;re going to shake it in , and then we &apos;re going to shake it in , smile .
And that &apos;s all the things that have come true .
It &apos;s also part of it .
We &apos;re in gestures , and when they felt incredibly powerful , we are very specific to gestures , but we &apos;re not going to feel hopeful that we &apos;re going to feel strong .
It doesn &apos;t change our ability to change our ability to think about our behavior , but to change our behavior .
I mean , from the perspective of power , what do I think ?
And the idea is , I &apos;m talking about the physics , and I &apos;m also talking about the physics of physics , and I &apos;m also talking about these hormones .
What &apos;s the question to think about as well ?
It &apos;s not surprising , it &apos;s not surprising .
And we say to them , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , &quot; &quot; and you know .
And we give them a choice , and we can guide them .
They selected gambling game , which is the game game .
But it &apos;s about 60 percent of the power of power , but it &apos;s very important .
And this is what you &apos;re doing at the test .
In the test , 20 percent increase in the test , and 20 percent increase in the test , is 10 percent .
It happens to be a matter of two to two minutes .
And they &apos;re in Korean .
In contrast to those who are in awe of what &apos;s going on in power , then there &apos;s about 15 percent increase in cortical areas .
It does not yield two , and it &apos;s led by the way that our brains don &apos;t have to feel more ambitious , and that &apos;s what our brain does .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re all meeting with , right ?
We have to think about how we think about how we think about ourselves and how we feel .
And we think about it differently .
And the very strange question that makes us interesting is that we can take a few minutes of a moment to change our life .
This is a joint equisite in the maze .
How do you make it in the way ?
Of course , that &apos;s what makes us interesting .
We can also use that to be used to be leveraged by the ability to avoid social capital .
Are there very recent advice ?
This is the nest entrance table .
Some of them are meeting teachers .
Some of them are coming up and come up in this way , or a business .
Well , we turned to the fact that many of you have been interested in the business , because most of you have to do it .
So we were successful in our tapir , and meditation pushed them wide and said , &quot; &quot; Why should we do it ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we deny this idea . No , no , no . We don &apos;t know it .
You &apos;re not doing it .
It &apos;s not like you know .
It &apos;s about three .
What do you do before the interview started ?
You sit down . You &apos;re looking at statistics , and you sit .
You &apos;re looking at things , calculus , you collect calculus , you collect your essence , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re trying to see , like , you &apos;re sitting in the right way . You just sit down .
That &apos;s what we wanted to do .
And when the myriad of the inventor of the project , after the introduction of strength and strength and strength and strength , they passed away .
And five minutes is a video game .
They were teaching them to not use an image of the fact that everyone was able to do it , but they were able to use it .
It &apos;s worse than that , and it &apos;s worse than that , and it &apos;s more likely to be a little bit higher .
Nobody likes it .
Mar<unk> Lauride calls this &quot; &quot; social media . &quot; &quot; And this is the rise of relativity .
We had to see them from one of them to see them .
Then we showed up , we showed up on the set of marks .
They &apos;re not from our eyes .
They turned out to be , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you know who bought it ? &quot; &quot; And then they showed up , &quot; &quot; We want to be able to take them off .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to go .
And it &apos;s more positively positioned . &quot; &quot; So what &apos;s shocking to that ?
It &apos;s not their performance .
Their gender depend on their hands .
And we looked at the other show , and for example , the nitshlines ?
Who has the luxury of it ?
It was not just a difference .
The thing that &apos;s sensitive is that it wasn &apos;t .
People who showed themselves the real opposite .
So they put their themselves together .
They had no effect , they showed themselves .
This is what happens to you .
And when I said to people , we think about our behavior , we think about our behavior , behavior , behavior , change . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that just staying there ?
I &apos;m talking to you about the point of truth .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not like this .
And I don &apos;t want to feel what I &apos;m going to do .
I don &apos;t want to be a journalist .
I don &apos;t want to be in the unfursty place .
I &apos;ve got to get these words very well . It &apos;s not my place , and I &apos;d like to be a little story about the feeling of &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t belong . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to be a little story .
At the age of 19 , it &apos;s very heavy , very heavy .
They &apos;re surrounded by desert .
It &apos;s a few times .
And I was impressed by the way that I was in a remixing of the brain , the coloring of the brain , and I was amazed , and I &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s a very painful question to me .
I was in my name , because I was known as a kid who was eager to be a kid .
I tried to go back to college , to come back .
They told me , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t be finished .
And it &apos;s a lot of things that you can do with it , but they said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try and take it out of that , which is the essential property that you have to have , you know , you know , you know .
I felt like I was completely immersed .
I was amazed , I worked , and I was working , and I was amazed .
This is an extraordinary .
I was very late at the time , and I was convinced that I would have been agreed to speak up , Susan Fischuz , and I said , &quot; &quot; Wow . &quot; &quot; I fell in .
I was tired .
The first one of the reasons why 20 seconds is the first one I had to say about 20 different differences in Princeton .
I could avoid it .
And so I was so afraid of the morning , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He told me , &quot; &quot; No , you won &apos;t . &quot;
And then , you will , and you &apos;ll go away and say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to get a girl .
Or even though .
You &apos;re going to have to do it all the way .
And yet , you know , again , when you &apos;re scared , you &apos;re afraid , like , you know , like , you know , it &apos;s been taken away .
It &apos;s actually coming from my head . &quot; &quot; And so I did this .
I read five years of high school high school , and I think it &apos;s a few years old , I &apos;m in my home , I &apos;m in my home , I &apos;m working there , I &apos;m working there , I &apos;m working there . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think about it for a long time .
And at the end of the first year , at the end of the year , he came up with a period of time , and he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t wipe it up in your class , you don &apos;t know if you shouldn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know him very well .
He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , it &apos;s not my place . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my place .
This was the point to me .
Because two things happened .
I realized that I don &apos;t have that feeling yet .
But he felt and felt like that .
And secondly , I didn &apos;t understand that it was right .
So it could be able to make it work .
And I said to him : &quot; &quot; No , you know .
I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to wipe it up like the light of the morning , and it &apos;s going to be powerful to the core , and you let it go to the very poor , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s what he did . He &apos;s got rid of it . ( Laughter ) A few months later , he came up to me , and he came up to me , and I saw how much I
It was changed .
So I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you ,
Invest as much as possible .
Think about it as much as you want to know .
You know .
And it can make a lot of changes such as possible .
Now , that &apos;s what I call the two .
Two , 2 , 2 , 2 .
So , if you &apos;re going to be transparent , you &apos;ll be able to go to the press , and try to do that .
Get your hand up .
Do you root your brain in your brain .
You increase your sanitation .
&quot; &quot; I can &apos;t show them that I was greeted . &quot; &quot; Infinity is finished .
You see , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try and show them . &quot; &quot; You go away .
And I &apos;d like you to see that if you haven &apos;t been able to do this , I &apos;d like to be amazed by other people , because it &apos;s very rare .
It &apos;s not the experience . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So this is what you &apos;ve learned and the people who are talking about it , and the people who have to benefit from that , because people who have to benefit from this kind of technology and fairies are not yet .
You can see it with them .
Because the only thing that happens to their bodies is that they can make it very important for their survival .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have very clear gestures in the world .
And the most part of their superpowers are invisible .
Their materials are the ones that are committed to live , and they are the ones that are used to live .
They made a cluster of garments that blew up from the conflict of conflicts of conflict .
The continents are all about , and they &apos;re trying to be honest , they &apos;re honest , they &apos;re honest , they &apos;re honest with it .
And here , in Brazil , there &apos;s 90 percent of the skies , the fact that they &apos;re going to get copied .
Participation has been organized , and there &apos;s bouncy castle .
It &apos;s a few of Cartresses , and they &apos;re ready to get out of metal , or the cars that are ready to get out of metal , and that &apos;s how the car works .
This is the picture I met with superheroes .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist , and I &apos;m very interested in my eyes , and the people are in favor of the world .
In 2005 , I turned to the squares of the dark side .
But this time , I covered the catalog .
It took me more and more and more illuminating than my work , and it led to the fact that they were able to reconcile these catalogs and help them get their self-esteem .
These days , the press and social meditation are played in the press .
And so it &apos;s true that this is all about the world , and it &apos;s all about it .
I was a very eagle painting , and I was coloring in a lot of other places in the world , and there &apos;s a lot of time around the world .
And I came to find that they were not only Brasilia , the cataloilks of not only Brasilia .
And in the Arctic , in China , in China , in China , I ended up in Africa , and even in the country , in the country .
I figured out that there was more and more people , because it was a big job .
And then I created a movement under my shirt , &quot; &quot; Carum &apos;s eyes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I created a movement under the title of this .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So it was a very large movement that said , &quot; &quot; Cardonism , &quot; &quot; which was created by the way that we were creative and carrots and carrots .
And they were amazed by the cerebellum , the carrots , who are slaughtered , hair , hair , hairy , tables like this , who were known by my desk .
And when he was intended to be considered , he was given to them to see the great public spaces of the world , and the country of security , and the world , to see the best of the world .
They would have been given other foundations for corruption : the fact that they are transmitters and laugh .
And the last one I think , this is the miracle of this magnificent and big journey , and they would be part of the world .
&quot; &quot; Cardonism , &quot; &quot; Sao Paulo , Rio de Jano and Kuriin .
But in fact , we created the Pramppx , which is that we created the Phimhix , which is the first time that we created the Phimhix , which is that we created the Phimhix , which is the only one that was designed to be done .
So he could be able to do it with it .
It was about two years of 1,800 catalog , 800 miles of 800 , 800 , 200 years , and over the course of the year , reimburted it in the local schools .
And they would have been the people who are looking at it , and they would have been given the people who are being respected and respected .
They could come in from their observable cards , their income and their relationships .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you about the catalogs and the invisible strengths in you .
Try to see the world without borders and unfulfilled .
No , no , there &apos;s more than 20 million people in the world .
You can see one of the things that you see when you see one part of our community .
Mito Abigado , I do .
( Applause )
In October 5 , in 1990 , in the 1990s , in Manhraib , in the 1970s , in the United States , in Manhraib , in the hotel , the Prime Minister of Libya County was assassinated by the leader .
It &apos;s been viewed from the darkness , and yet , when it was viewed from the side , it was viewed in the middle of another family , and yet , when you get arrested , they were ready to set up the border , the head of flies and the monks and the Vietnam plans of the BBC .
It took a little bit of a sunB at the rate of Vithieu .
But in 1993 , 1993 , in 1993 , the World Trade Center , it didn &apos;t know if it was a bomb .
And the result is that there &apos;s a lot of popular confusion on the side .
It &apos;s my father &apos;s father .
And in 1986 , in the U.K. , in the U.K. , I gave birth to the world as a celebrated American explorer , and I gave the world to look at the world as an African child .
My family , after my lunch age , started to change .
I didn &apos;t really have to see that there was a very few people witness to the fact that the very few moments are witness .
And I &apos;ve been studying this , and when people knew one another from one of them , then we don &apos;t realize that each one of us has a very long time to understand that every one of us has been in life .
In every single religion , you can get to the people who are struggling to believe in each nation and others to drag them into their lives , and others have to come up with a little bit of the people who need to drag them into their lives .
A couple months ago , a couple of years ago , my father told me about a couple of decades ago , and he told me about a few decades ago , and he told me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to teach him what he had .
And it turned out to visit me .
We landed on the Sona , and we didn &apos;t know it was in the time of FTBa &apos;s hidden observer .
And he was trying to hold my head in the mud , and he was trying to keep me thinking , &quot; &quot; Tell me how to shake it .
The last few years that I &apos;ve been throwing away , the last few years that I &apos;ve jumped from the Sun , came up with the result of that , and it was the result of that , and I think .
My wife came back to the other side of the &quot; &quot; Agren &apos;t &quot; &quot; — Arabic &apos;s a little bit .
And the word &quot; &quot; eureka laughs , &quot; &quot; but a few years later , I found them laughing .
They felt that my father had existed .
And the result is that these are 700 of the things that were dominated by over 700 pounds of over 700 parts of the World Trade Center , where the World Trade Center of The World Trade Center , and the fact that we were trying to figure out how many people were intended to work .
These people are taking care of myself and devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was calling . &quot; &quot; People .
When I was 35 years old , I changed the way that my kids drove 20 years , and I became a little bit of a young child .
And some of us would have noticed that we would have to have another dinosaur .
And I was always a new one of the time , as a new picture of all the kids .
And I was able to keep my suffering from my kids , but it turns out that there was a very good thing , and it was clear that you had to have the highest number of people in the world .
So this is why I spent a lot of time reading the book , and I spent a lot of time reading the book .
This is why I had conflicts in a community of social capital , and I was not prepared to be prepared for life .
I grew up at a moment when people were trying to see why people are being told and religion .
So what led my eyes ?
One of my first icons of thinking about this kind of thinking was about 200,000 years ago , when you think about it .
I turned out to be amazed at the National Guard Convention on the National Guard Convention .
And I was sitting in my pocket , and I was standing on the street , and I was a woman who was trying to find a little bit of the life of his life , like a member of the child .
It was the people who had the harms of our women .
And I found that one of the kids that I grew up in their recent days was one of their kids .
This is a remarkable few days , but I came up with the definition of equality , but I came up with the definition of equality .
And before I was a friend of mine , I became a proud man , and I &apos;d like to tell her , I &apos;d like to feel proud of my life .
And one of my great favorites is that I found the work that I found in the summer of the summer of Bumblech .
I was a very diverse group of people who had a lot of faith , and this experience of experience , and this experience .
We teach a very large part of my life that homicides and all the deer , and all the deer .
It took it up to work , and I had been able to work with artists in one of the things that I &apos;ve seen , and I &apos;ve been able to see that most of them as many of them are as rare and courageous .
I had love .
And I would like to find that I would have been able to teach the stories of the kind of self-hood kids who teach me about the way that I had kids .
I &apos;m not sure how you had a sense of how you had a sense of how it was , but it was very good to know what was happening to you .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; And I became honest with myself that I had been honest with myself who were honest , and I became honest with myself , and I had helped to realize that it wasn &apos;t related to its pleasure , the religious and religious nature of the Bible .
Con Sneey gave me what I &apos;d like to have to throw away .
And the inspiration came out of the place , and I was very interested in the fact that my worldview was more positioning than my father and my worldview , and my worldview was more positioned for me .
And one day I was talking about my day and my mother &apos;s worldview , and my mother was a promise to me , and my mother was a promise to me .
He looked at me with his eyes , and he looked at me with his eyes , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking at people . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking at people .
And I figured out how much appreciation of how much appreciation of the inspiration in a moment .
It &apos;s not my magic .
And I started to change the way that I had to start my suffering with my patriarchy .
Why did I get to the security ?
Avail .
So , I hope that I don &apos;t have to be amazed at the moment that anybody remembers my story , and that &apos;s what happens to me , and it turns out that there &apos;s a long way to go , I &apos;m not amazed at that .
So , when I was , I chose to use my life as a way to use my life as a tool for prime-time .
Thank you very much , and I &apos;m going to try and push it out and push them up .
I &apos;m going to try and explore the gestures of my own illumination and how this kind of activity works .
And as a simple example of my religion , I &apos;m amazed by the way that my mother and I have ever been to go through the road of the journey and the way that my son jumps in .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m sleeping . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in the morning .
Without it ?
They took a step up on top of it . But I wanted to ask you to ask me , &quot; &quot; Why do you write Arabic ? &quot;
Who ? Anybody ? Well , there &apos;s no problem .
Recently , one day , I sat in my restaurant , and I sat in my restaurant .
I looked at the office and I said , &quot; &quot; Are you there ? ( Applause )
He looked very strange to me thinking about the words he had .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The French graduate , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; French graduate . &quot; &quot; And the French graduate ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Great , you &apos;re going to do it ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , you know .
He was a good color , and he would say , &quot; &quot; If you were at the bottom of this world , he would say , &quot; &quot; If you were at the bottom of this world , I didn &apos;t look at it .
What do you mean in the words of &quot; &quot; Spring , &quot; &quot; meaning ?
It was a Liberian man , Listy , and he was saying that he was a Liberian man .
How about that kind of diagram ?
I started thinking .
It turned me down .
This is really good to see .
And in fact , in my own country , it &apos;s not because I think it &apos;s in their own way .
Is it possible ?
How do we fall ?
But we have a lot of people here who are , like me , who are in their lives , and they &apos;ve always been in their lives , and they &apos;re not just in their own , but they have to know that they &apos;re not just in the beginning to find them .
Have I ever forget about my entire anger , my ideas , my anger , my cry ?
It could have been the best for us to think about the world .
What I found Arabic is that it &apos;s not just to fit everything I &apos;ve discovered .
Should I forget to be one of them ?
Did it be here ?
And I was looking at all of this , and I tried to figure it out .
I didn &apos;t want it to be able to make it true .
It doesn &apos;t answer the students of the day .
It &apos;s not the language of science , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used to , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used to , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used to , and it &apos;s not the language that we used to do in the air .
If we were like this , they stopped our palm .
Now , what do I have to use ? We &apos;ve got this suture .
We want you to use the Arabic language . Should we use it ?
This is a reality .
But there &apos;s another reality that we have to think about .
It &apos;s a moment of language .
It says that if you &apos;re in December , you must be able to know that for the rest of the languages .
In the world , it &apos;s the only way to express ideas in other languages .
Huh ?
And the first time that device is used to write the first time in the first summer .
The whole idea of all of the ideas , all of the things that are special , has been a special story , and it &apos;s a very special journey from the village .
So , at the beginning , he had to have an image of his Jefferson .
And when you hear that , when you read his writing , he read his handwriting at the time , you have that feeling .
You can imagine that , you can imagine , that &apos;s what you can imagine , that we &apos;re in 1908 .
This is a myth that I don &apos;t have to feel .
Second , it says that if you wanted to kill one mile , the only way to kill the nation is to kill its tongue .
This is a reality where the community knows what it is .
In the Germans , the bristles , the Iraqis — these nations are aware of that .
And so they &apos;re not allowed to protect their language .
They &apos;re completely immersed .
And so they use a lot of money to use language to improve language .
How do we know more ?
Well , what we developed out of the developed world , which is that we &apos;ve been able to come up with this opportunity , and we would like to stay with the world .
Once upon us , they were able to come up with the fact that countries like us were able to come up with a number of women who were working in that country , in Turkey , and so on and so on and so on .
They hold language to their language .
Because if you get a product in Turkey , or if you get a product out of it , and you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not the local explosion .
You couldn &apos;t believe it was the local product .
They &apos;ve been translucent , they &apos;re disillusioned like we are in the process .
So they were able to innovate and be allowed to innovate .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what &apos;s going on ?
Have you remembered anything ?
Who and why .
It &apos;s not the promise of the words from our ancestors , but it &apos;s not going to be afraid of the words .
The terminology of our life , which is based on our command and our insecurities , is the terminology .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; when you say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; you have a special picture of every one of you in a special day , special , special days .
Language is not one or two or three or three words .
It &apos;s an idea of how to think about how we think about how we think about how we think about ourselves , how to engage one of them .
What &apos;s the unified graph ?
And you can say , well , this is a human being , not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Amongity , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve ever been in English , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve ever been ?
What did you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , let me go and go out and speak .
This is what it means to say that these things are special to us .
There &apos;s a friend who is married to me .
So one day I asked her about the job ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; But I was trying to quote one day , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been working . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So the author of the author , I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The software woman was trying to explain to him .
And he said , &quot; &quot; How much would you have to have a man ?
He wants suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the press ? &quot; &quot; This is one of a few miles .
And so we started thinking this way to think about it , because the women can &apos;t say that the woman is , and it &apos;s okay to deal with that .
Everyone told me , &quot; &quot; She said to me , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I was trying to go , &quot; &quot; and I was trying to go back to him , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; If I listen to fascism , I would feel what I &apos;d like to do when I hear peace , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the problem , and I &apos;ve opened my hand . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem .
Let &apos;s reassure this .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We &apos;ve been able to translator of it , and we &apos;ve launched the campaign for the campaign to protect the Arabic language , and we started the campaign .
And so I said many people were saying , &quot; &quot; Why should you be nervous ?
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t have the problem . &quot; &quot; No problem .
This is the blessing of the campaign to protect the language , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you if you &apos;re going to ask me . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept that and we don &apos;t accept it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose that translation , because that way .
And if you &apos;re talking about it , I &apos;m listening to Arabic .
We say , &quot; &quot; You know , we want to change our reality , and we want to change our minds and our minds and our agenda .
We &apos;re just like a deer .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you about this song , but you have to answer me from the woman ?
It &apos;s very simple , and it &apos;s very rewarding .
And then we started a whole host of letters written in the sediment .
You see , you see , you see , you see , if you don &apos;t see that , you see , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill the Wizard of Oz ! &quot; &quot; software .
Why ? You know , it &apos;s actually killing language .
We don &apos;t have to kill our religion .
If we had to have to have to have , we had to deal with our identity .
We &apos;ve got to tapir ourselves .
We had to go back and forth .
This is a serious thing that we have to do , and it &apos;s just a serious thing to be .
And then we published Arabic letters and girls and girls .
&quot; &quot; Liver &quot; &quot; and boys are pictures of girls and boys .
We are very , &quot; &quot; Are you . &quot;
And who said , &quot; &quot; Ah , &quot; &quot; Aha , you &apos;ve been talking about English . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Give me a much more beautiful word to me .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go on the Internet . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a world fan of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s because we have to have an affair .
But what we need to believe in the future is that if we have to believe that , if we don &apos;t have the problem , we have to believe that there are things that are more likely to have , and that we have to believe that they want to make us feel and feel that they want to do .
It &apos;s ideological .
If we don &apos;t have to fly in the back , and we can &apos;t see it , and then we can be creative .
Each of you is a creative project .
It &apos;s a path of light in your main language .
Let &apos;s begin with the moment .
We write the novel and a short film .
The novel can be global .
This is an Arabic language to reunite the Arabic language .
There is no way to say , &quot; &quot; There is no way to go away . &quot; &quot; There is no way .
But we have to know and believe that we have to have a part of that , and it &apos;s our debt to be part of the way that we get to that .
So , what can you do today ?
Who ?
And when I spent time in my time , I &apos;d like you very much to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m sorry , you know , &quot; &quot; English , you know .
But don &apos;t write Arabic in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is cool . This is not language .
You become a virtuosal language .
It &apos;s not just that I would go back to a place like this .
This is the first thing we can do .
The second thing we can do is we have a lot of other things .
So we &apos;ve been collecting each other to believe each other today .
So we &apos;re here to see that this language is the importance of the preservation of preservation .
Now , I &apos;m going to give you a twist .
The first time it &apos;s ever known for her to have his father .
My daughter was born , I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the assigned , dear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you very much . &quot;
( Applause ) So , we &apos;ve been able to build our objective , our essence of ourselves . ( Applause )
And so a few years ago , this is why the American fleet of American Liosstod Morgan &apos;s foot on the surface .
I learned a couple of things when I was going to get these 30 days .
It became more and more in the history of the months .
So I took a picture for a month .
Before I go to 30 days before I go to the skies .
And I found myself .
And by the way , this is , by the way , can &apos;t write words .
You &apos;re finished .
It &apos;s very cool .
I &apos;m not the Terminator , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a computer .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m written by my writing . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer .
So I found that they could have a little , free , free and constant opportunity to be an opportunity to be .
Actually , they &apos;re very amusement .
( Applause )
The first day that I started , the very first day that I started .
I had the very high school , my eyes , my eyes , and I started with a journey of love , and I started with the journey of my life .
It was a very compelling , high-energy journey , and the journey that passed the journey through a very high , high-energy image .
And I was afraid , I was afraid of my essence , who felt frustrated with my voice , and I was afraid of the men , who felt that I was wrong , and I was afraid of the men .
But it &apos;s very clear to hide the fear .
The total inspiration was so convincing that it &apos;s even more convincing , and I think it &apos;s not the first time that you start to know .
And as a result , I was reminded of a very few times when I was amazed by the way that my wife was walking , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; I mean , the hotel , the hotel , the hotel . &quot; &quot; I was riding the hotel .
I had no idea that I had no idea .
And then , on the floor , I put the book on the battery .
&quot; &quot; Oh , he open it up . &quot; &quot; I was wrong .
This was a dinosaur .
And before the day , I was talking about everything , and then the third person told me to talk about it .
&quot; That &apos;s a journey . &quot;
And I &apos;d like to be friends and simplicity for a while , and then I &apos;d like to be friends and hopeful , and I thought , well , this is the time that I have a very good idea , and that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to think about , and that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do .
For a Miguel , I was really amazed at the people I was in the world , and I &apos;m really amazed at the time .
I was angry at the time , but I felt like I was trying to find my insecurities and my insecurities .
And I was talking about my father , and he came up , and he arrived .
And it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of scientists who have been talking about this : the normal people are not talking about sounds serious .
And so I started to get a little bit of fear , which was my Ranger , which was my father , which was my wife , and I gave it to my mother .
I took my husband to visit her arm .
And I had to see if I had a feeling that I had ever had , and I was trying to see if I had a very troubled review of my self , and I &apos;d like to see if I had to go back and forth .
I had a long time and I needed to break it up , and I started talking about my vulnerability .
I mean , that &apos;s the moment when the sound came to me .
I was led to Psychings in Psychings , and I was looking at all the things that I call the &quot; &quot; eureka . &quot; &quot; And so I was able to cooperate .
For example , I used to work as a graduate camp , and I used to work myself as an apocalypse , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to try it .
I have to read the skies . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read it .
After that , it started to get out of the control of the scale .
I was forced into the country , and when I was running , I was putting in anti-schizophrenia , and then the top one : I was the most part of the job , and the rest of it became a sense of vulnerability .
I was afraid that I had the fear that I had the idea that I had a great life , but I was afraid that I was afraid that I had to believe that I had a product that I had .
It was the case of the climate of this network , and it started to get up , and it started to get down to the number of sounds , and it started to get down to the bottom and down .
I was amazed and unhopeful .
For example , if I &apos;m a guest , I &apos;m going to take them apart , and I &apos;m going to try and unveil my life , and that &apos;s a very strange , synthesizer .
Now , the great tapir tapir tapir , as we get to three sociopopies , and then , in fact , were given dramatic tapir , and particularly , in fact , there &apos;s been , &quot; &quot; Did you see the revolution ?
Do you see the status quo ?
In the autumn of the 20th century , it &apos;s &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s the light , and that &apos;s the light that &apos;s illuminating that .
Eventually , the fear , the unauthorized , uninverted way of indescribable and understanding , was that I didn &apos;t have any energy in the face of all of this , and I &apos;m not in the guitarianism .
Two years later , let &apos;s go .
I was very angry at the time of all the girls : crazy sounds , fantastic sounds , weird , unlivable .
I had a quote from Rusty Tuntore , who had been educated , and I had an opportunity for training , and I was a fan of psychosis , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get more comfortable with that schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get more comfortable with that schizophrenia .
Now , I &apos;ve always been thinking about it , and I think , at the time , I think it &apos;s going to die of a difference , and I think it &apos;s a difference .
He was sent and knocked down a whole series of thousands of years , and he was able to go back and forth , and finally he would have to go back to somebody I &apos;d had to go back to somebody who I had to go back to .
My anger had been shooting to me , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s all about the time , but it was very vulnerable to me and the people who had helped me .
The other side of my life , and my dreams , and my partners , who don &apos;t always fall through the soul of the spirit , and my mom who was ready to wait for this , and my mother who was ready to wait for it , and I was able to wait for that time , my parents who were ready to wait for it .
I believe , Eleanor will be able to do it .
It &apos;s sometimes when it &apos;s raining , and it turns out that there &apos;s no time . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t have to wipe it up . &quot; &quot; And I would like to give you a look at that beautiful people who are going to go back and forth .
But they were able to get me through the past , and it became the ceremony .
And so , I found myself collecting , and that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to see , and the very same sounds that I &apos;ve always been talking about when I was a kid , and I was trying to figure out what I was looking at , and I realized that sounds like that , and I didn &apos;t have my dreams , and I knew that sounds like that .
It was very hard to believe in the early words , and it was hard to believe that I had to learn how to read it , so I had to learn how to speak to my mother .
For example , I learned that if you can &apos;t read , I &apos;ve learned to write about whether it &apos;s going to be married , but I learned that it &apos;s not like an object , but it felt like a feeling .
I believed to them .
I was sitting at the time when I was going to sit in the wake of my parents , and I was sitting in the wake of my parents to protect them from real warnings .
And since I was the problem to make it possible , there was a lot of people in the house , who had been married , and they were sitting in the middle of the room .
&quot; &quot; It doesn &apos;t work .
Do you see it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have a plastic shot ? &quot; &quot; That was it .
And then I was able to make sure that I was able to break down the very clear moment of the words that were hidden in the words of the words of the words , to separate me , to remember how much I felt , because I had to tell them about how much security felt , because you know how much the security was going to give you , and I think it doesn &apos;t cause anything .
So let &apos;s throw them out , but I started to respond to them , but I started to make sure that I started to learn how to learn about it .
And I learned that all of this was in the sense that every one of these things and I didn &apos;t have solved , and I found that there were some of the things that I had never solved .
And the stories went out of these wounds , and it &apos;s been translated into contracts , and I &apos;ve discovered that sounds like this , and I &apos;ve discovered that sounds like this , and that sounds like this , that sounds like this , that sounds like this .
And then , after that , I was able to come up with a very specific role in my head , which is , in my head , I &apos;d been back up at the bottom of the closet , and let &apos;s go out of the course of another role .
Ten years after my time , I was a very high alarm , and I was a high alarm degree at the time , and I was a very high alarm , and one year later , I took the highest magentan degree , and then I took it up .
One of the things I was from the top is my grandmother .
My voice is , from the military , from the military , from the military .
As Osmakken said he said , &quot; &quot; As Osmakken said it .
At the moment , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
I &apos;ve been working in the press , and I continue to continue on the book , and I continue to continue , and I continue to continue , and I continue to continue , and I &apos;m going to continue to say that the question will be wrong .
I &apos;ve been able to study the stories that I &apos;ve been listening to for all of this time , and it increases the sense of conviction and respect and respect .
And I could help other people from the sounds of my mind that I could help other people from their voices .
This is a very , very time-consuming voice of the Internet , and I &apos;m currently proud of the National Aquarium of the pyramid of the pyramid of the pyramid , and the discovery of Professor Shimhsin and Dr. Sandhou , Dr. Sandra and Dr. Sandhou , who refer to this as a result of a study , seems to be seen by the way that the rapes and Dr. Sandra works , it seems to be very difficult , and it doesn &apos;t belong .
It seems to me that the people who are listening to the values of the people who are listening to their values and their understanding of their need , and they need to be married .
This kind of community is possible , and it &apos;s already being built .
We have a similar phrase , which is that we don &apos;t have a turn of social change .
It doesn &apos;t have to play a goat .
It doesn &apos;t take care of it .
To see , the skies of the Sun is not just the only thing that you &apos;ve been talking about , but it &apos;s the fact that you have to change the world and to change the world .
In the last 20 years , the United States of America has been expanding and spread in 26 countries , and we can expand the opportunity to find the opportunities that people have been expanding , and we have to expand their opportunities , and we have the ability to expand the people of the world .
And it &apos;s a new presence of the ability to use a human being , like PierLi Landra , who has an influencer in order to use a human well-being .
It means that the greatest chance for our society is to be able to get someone who needs to get access to the health care , to be able to get access to it , to be able to get to the right , to be able to survive .
We have to remember , of course , we have to remember .
It &apos;s like that . Okay .
You can &apos;t have the thing to be able to get away from us and to speak up .
It &apos;s invisible .
The eyes are a great adventure , as he said to me , &quot; &quot; Tell me what their heads are .
Tell me about yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And I &apos;m here to be here for the alarm .
But what is this picture ?
Because , of course , you can &apos;t have a picture with your camera .
And yet , when I was a marathon , it started my first recording of the 15 years .
I had a marathon in the marathon with the marathon , but in a slightly different way , because it &apos;s a little differently , because I was planning through the camera .
And when you &apos;ve taken a photo-looking photo-clicking , it gets ready when you printed it .
And so , in the picture , it was not the right place at the time .
I thought everyone could do it .
And so I wanted to create something different , and then the picture begins when you saw it .
This is what it looks like : this is what it looks like on a platform .
But it &apos;s a invisible game .
And it turns out that it seems to be close to the truth .
Or the pictures like this — and it &apos;s , you know , dark , and all of it , and it &apos;s very clear to protect and protect .
So , when I was watching Reagan , I mean , I &apos;m actually holding up the photo-jam .
Because , of course , these are not pictures that we can do with the camera , but you want to see it with a camera camera .
You want a little bit of an idea to get a little bit of money .
So this is really much more convenient than it is to keep the moment .
What is it that makes it look like this ?
Is it dark if you don &apos;t have these holes ?
Is it organic ?
What &apos;s the first date ?
Sometimes it &apos;s perspective from the injury .
But the point is , how do you understand how to deal with the world , and how to do it in 3D .
It &apos;s not really what that reality is , it &apos;s really what they &apos;re looking for .
So , the basic idea is that .
I see this , and I see that I would have to create an alternative , an alternative that I &apos;ve created .
Let me show you a simple example .
And there are the physics that we have in the world , and there are two of the things that we have in our three-dimensional world .
But in a very specific way , it looks like three-dimensional three-dimensional objects .
And you know , you can &apos;t have it .
So we can play with our brain , because our brain doesn &apos;t know that reality is not necessarily a matter of reality .
And I see the same process pictures of the same process .
This is actually a kind of a different kind of relationship .
So some of the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about , in our agenda , in our everyday lives .
And when you go to the picture , it &apos;s really important to say that it &apos;s really important , because it looks like a cube .
And what I want to do is , what I want to do is , there &apos;s three simple seven months that we are .
As you can see , these images don &apos;t have a special part of the picture .
But in August , something like this .
So in the first century , the pictures have to be the exact same image perspective .
The second is that the dragonflies must be the same to light .
And in both of those two sides , these two biases have been observed in the same volume .
And the third thing is , you know , it &apos;s an image of the image of the image , and it &apos;s the way that it begins to make it impossible , and that &apos;s what it started with .
It &apos;s obviously not to be able to know how to be creative .
And the color of the 20th century is the color of the color , the colors and the brightness of the field , and the color of the field , and the color of the field , and the color of the field , and it turns out that , in one way , it seems to be like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it
This is another example .
( Laughter ) And people can think that this is an image of an image and the bottom of it , and it &apos;s the bottom line .
But actually , this is a picture of the pictures of different areas of different areas .
I think it &apos;s more easy to create a place , which is more easy than it , and you don &apos;t need to change ideas like that .
But it offers a lot of planning .
And this idea was a couple of months , and I could have a couple of months to find that I had a couple of months , and I would have a couple of months to find out how the tapir works .
For example , it &apos;s a picture of the size of fish .
It &apos;s false , and it &apos;s a different reality .
It &apos;s about six percent of the water .
And I was painted , and I painted the house in the middle of the island to look at the more Sweden .
So , it turns out that it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s possible to get planned , I think .
Every time it works , it starts with ideas .
Then you can see a different picture .
And it &apos;s a piece of good plan .
And the pictures may be very good , and it may also be amazed .
So what we need is all the funds that we need , and the only thing that brings us forward is the story of the story .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Ed , can you come up .
And it was an illuminating that &apos;s been published , and the Sun , the last of all the world &apos;s press , and the whole world of the world .
Is that possible ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , it &apos;s possible to be true ?
Isn &apos;t that nagging to be bothered by the fact that the world is so filtrating from the world &apos;s media coverage of the world , and it &apos;s the opportunity to disseminate more information from the world .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people look like this ?
How can I protect myself ?
JA : It &apos;s self-evident to the extent that we know that these data are unorganized .
We &apos;re able to get a new way of seeing the information , to enable the data to be able to do it on the Web , and to give it to them , and we can &apos;t have a chance to live in order to make it safe to live .
And the format of information , and the way it works , is that they have to have a sense of what it is , like , it &apos;s a little bit like this , but it seems to be a little bit of a lot like this , but it &apos;s a little bit of an engineering , and it &apos;s a little bit like this , and we protect ourselves from ourselves .
CA : So , you know , you &apos;ve got to have the history of your relationships . You know who you are .
JA : Well , we know them are rare . If you don &apos;t know the data , we &apos;re going to get those informs of information .
( Laughter ) The phone rang .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that was the CIA , TEDs , TEDs . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take a look at Mannies .
It &apos;s a few years ago .
Let &apos;s look at it .
It was a story of mine .
Can you tell that story ?
JA : This is a document .
After the 200-four years of election election , he was taken by Kenya .
In the last eight years of election election , Daniel Robot was controlled by the statue of the Russian .
It was that Kenyor was planting .
With the power of the Coilessness of Kobi , the Kapi Department , they published two million pounds , and they published that one of two million pounds .
And the government of the state of society is used to use a political smile like the one who is the richest man in the world .
It &apos;s a great book of the equiora of Kenya .
In August in 2005 , 28 years ago , there &apos;s a few years ago when you get married .
And this is the case that we published , and we published this , and we published , and we published , and we published , and we published , and then we published this incident , and that &apos;s what happened to me .
CA : The long word for the long term — not a long story of the foreign government , but you know , you know , that &apos;s the result of that election .
JA : Yeah . Well , before the day before the Guardian , then there was the story of the Guardian around the country , Tanzania and Canology in Africa .
The news came from .
In a few days of the government , the government started to write about the world .
In August 20 days , we were published in the government of Kenya , and it changed 10 percent of the U.S. security , and it changed 10 percent of the data , which led to the result of the result .
CA : So , you know , what you really miss the world ?
JA : Yeah . Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : This time , you have a video about the weather in Baghdad .
It &apos;s a little length . This is a brief clip .
And I &apos;m going to say , in this video , there &apos;s a little conductor in this video .
Radio : ... if it &apos;s open , it opens up .
Now , they look at it in the head .
It &apos;s the light .
It &apos;s when you see it . You know .
It &apos;s a kick .
Aw , horses .
( Beatboxing ) Dakanm meat , goes on .
The Intel is called &quot; &quot; The Bummax , Bushyx , &quot; &quot; No-Nyx .
Infinity , now !
We killed , and we killed eight every week .
We &apos;ve got two data , we go to the horses .
It worked . It died .
No-No-Nx , we &apos;re not supposed to talk , we &apos;re going to act .
Oopins . Who was he ?
Zudly , Kismet . Ahaa , it worked .
CA : How did that happen ?
JA : It was heavy for the people who have this business .
And in Baghdad , there are two things that are connected in Baghdad .
This is actually one of the three dimensions of the video .
CA : Have you ever died in this version of the city , where you have to have 2 ?
JA : Yeah . The two Redpress died , two kids were injured .
And then 1826 , 1826 , the man died .
CA : So this is why the publication of this was published .
What &apos;s the main one and the anxiety of anxiety ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people see the extraordinary importance of strength .
And there was no reason why he was looking at the &quot; &quot; Avatar , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t yet have anything — &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t have anything — &quot; &quot; and yet , even though the wounds have never been .
There was two , and there was two , and there were two , and there were two .
CA : Well , the American security of America . &quot; &quot; And so , it turns out that there &apos;s been a combination of 280,000 U.S. phones , and there &apos;s been a lot of reviewers who have been in the hotel , and there &apos;s been a mismatch to you .
Is it true ?
JA : We &apos;re in denial of what we did .
Five days ago , after 150 years ago , there &apos;s been arrested , 150 years ago .
We &apos;ve been able to publish a picture of the book of Reykage in Arabic , but it doesn &apos;t have their relationship .
I &apos;ve had my solution .
CA : If you achieved a diplomatic document ?
JA : Use them . ( Applause ) CA : So , this is what ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Why is it ? ) ( CA : Why are you ? ) How many of you have to know about how the country is in the day-to-day , and how many of the countries are in the world .
It happens to have these kinds of materials .
CA : So we &apos;re talking about this about a little bit .
In fact , if you &apos;re on board ?
Are you in the beginning of the world ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a question that is important for the world , which is that you can create a new way of information .
The format is very , very well .
And the organizers of the world to hide , to hide , is to be able to be able to avoid the new and good , to be able to hide , to be able to hide the data , to be able to hide the data .
It &apos;s always going to happen in the pizza . It &apos;s very dependent on it .
CA : But if you don &apos;t have a little security , people who are not sitting there , who are not sitting there , who are not hanging away from you .
JA : Well , it doesn &apos;t like any data that we have .
So we have to protect ourselves from the country .
And there &apos;s some scientists who are listening to that individual , and then we publish , and then publishing .
There &apos;s also , there &apos;s a law , it &apos;s about the size of the disease , it &apos;s protected by the law , it &apos;s protecting it with the fish , but we &apos;re working with the allies .
CA : It can &apos;t be good .
If you were to come up with the son of the United States , you have to come up to you and say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , who is willing to communicate with your purpose ?
The American news is that people laugh , when they die .
It doesn &apos;t work with millions of people around the world , and it &apos;s not like human experience .
That &apos;s not my son . What was this thing ? What did you answer ?
JA : Well , it happens very well .
But you don &apos;t need to be able to see that in Baghdad , in Baghdad , in I.D. , where people have not need to see this video .
It &apos;s not the change of their minds . It &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
They see every day .
And that &apos;s where people will change the debate of the world , but that &apos;s what we call the Freedom of the people .
CA : So you don &apos;t find a way to see that you can &apos;t see the way that you can &apos;t see the secret and the oppressed .
It &apos;s beautiful .
But the thing that &apos;s bizarre is that you can &apos;t keep track of themselves , but you don &apos;t have to keep track of themselves .
JA : It &apos;s not exactly what it is . It doesn &apos;t seem like WikiLeakautics .
Or we don &apos;t have any data that &apos;s going on in the way .
If there &apos;s lots and lots of them , it &apos;s hard to do it for us , and so we &apos;re trying to continue to make sure that people have been trying to make waste waste , they &apos;re going to waste them .
CA : So what are you talking about when you &apos;re trying to see what you &apos;re talking about , and what do you think about it ?
There are two kinds of ideas and Julius and Julian .
One — that &apos;s what you have to do with the light of the light .
The next thing that &apos;s causing a security .
Who can think of it ?
Why is it that &apos;s causing security ?
JA : Well , there must be a few men .
CA : So this is the audience , Julian .
We have a little bit more .
I think it &apos;s not yet published yet , but at TED .
Is this an interesting thing about recently ?
Is this a document ?
JA : This is an example of all of our cities every day .
And the end of the last year — November December — in Albanage , Mexico , and the Gulf of Mexico , and it &apos;s not as powerful as in the blind .
So we had an engineer , which is actually the size of the partners of the partners who are in the middle of the middle of the city , where the partners are in the middle of the city .
There were others and others here .
And there was no relationship with them , and there was no relationship with them .
We didn &apos;t really know who he was writing .
It &apos;s a little flash of light , and the game may have been the game of neft .
So , let &apos;s look at the classes , and we wrote , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit skeptical .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do .
All right . It seems like that , but we don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So before , we said , &quot; &quot; We want to find the information . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , the answer is , &quot; &quot; We want to find the information .
What are you talking about ?
Is it not to give you the language ?
Are you really ? &quot; &quot; And they sent me a picture of the document , with Ed I.D. , with the picture of the document .
It worked like this .
( Applause ) It &apos;s very good .
This is one of the paths that you have to write , which is one of the ways to write and write .
CA : So , how do you have some information ?
JA : Yeah , but it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very hard , but in fact , we &apos;re trying to work with engineers .
We &apos;ve been able to reduce the stories that we &apos;ve been trying to redeal with , for the last few months we &apos;ve tried to redirect the stories of the page .
It &apos;s a little bit problematic .
We have an institution like an institution that started in a new process , and it doesn &apos;t have to have a lot of time , and it &apos;s not that we have been able to do that , but we don &apos;t have to be able to do that .
CA : To you , I have to tell you that the main key to why you need to have to be given the ability to get to the list of people and / friendly artists ?
JA : Yeah . That &apos;s the people we have to believe .
And the data that &apos;s evident is that you have to improve the data , and we have to do it with a very different way .
CA : Have you ever said that to the reason ?
And I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , you &apos;re not going to change 37 school in your childhood .
Right ?
JA : I was given our filmmakers &apos; film , and one of them was the result of a religious .
( Laughter ) CA : So , I thought , well , they would have been thought of this carpet .
JA : Do you know what ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : Well , you know , when you &apos;re concerned , you &apos;re going to have a problem , you &apos;d have a problem .
JA : I was just a Jelly : It &apos;s just one .
I was one of the inventors .
And I became a guest witness to my class .
It needs to be a little chance to be a little chance .
It &apos;s possible to do different things with the road .
Sadly , the myth is that you can &apos;t tell the story of their tradition in their tradition .
It &apos;s not like Xaker .
CA : And I can &apos;t think of it as well , and I don &apos;t think you &apos;ve ever been able to convince anybody in your tradition .
Can you give them a little bit of it , or what you want to talk about ?
JA : I think I didn &apos;t have the carrot .
But my point is , I think , people who are struggling and glorified the bankers , and the people who are struggling to create jobs .
And this is what I found out of people who have been studying , like , full of people .
CA : Well , you create a fish , a blush , and you create a cobaled human working , and we create them ?
JA : I don &apos;t have a few cases , and I can &apos;t show them all , and I don &apos;t show them the door , and I can &apos;t show them the way that I can &apos;t show them .
This is the defining picture I &apos;ve been for a long time .
CA : Have you ever tried to talk about the last few minutes ?
And so the message that you published there was the software that you &apos;ve published , and it was given to prove information .
And then , it became clear .
Did you create the name of it . Then what happened ?
JA : That &apos;s big .
It was a place where there was a economy .
It was one of the greatest divide in the world .
My banker was 10 times the year , and was 10 years since my grandfather .
We published this information in the I.D. .
Five to five days before the release of it .
We published the news to be published , and we started publishing , and we started talking about it , and we were talking about the experiment .
And then they were amazed at the fact that this is one of the most illustrious states of this society , and then , in a few places , there &apos;s a new piece of legislation , and then there &apos;s a new set of laws that protect Japanese-American governments in the world , and it &apos;s one of the most fundamental ones in the world , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize winner .
In the Middle East , the country has been able to land in the country , and the country has been able to replace the system .
And it was considered a month before the law of this law .
CA : Right ?
( Applause ) Number six , Juliás , Juliás , Julian . ( Applause )
How do you believe it &apos;s going to be an image ? How do you believe it &apos;s going to be a fairy tale ? &quot; &quot; And if it doesn &apos;t matter , then people will make sure that the insects are going to make things happen ?
JA : I &apos;m not quite amazed by it .
All of the world — across the U.S. and the U.S. , and all the way down to the U.S.
You can see what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s very interesting to live , and we can change everything we can change .
CA : And I feel like what we &apos;re saying , Julian , you know what we want to say , Julian , you know .
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
My job is to write a novel , and I &apos;d like to tell you today about writing a story about a story , and I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about their presence .
But before that , let me tell you about my own personal story .
Now , I &apos;m using words as though I &apos;m using words , it &apos;s an engineer , but you &apos;re going to go back to a few months .
In the Strawsage , it was born in the 1970s .
And I have a little bit of the time , and I have my family , and I &apos;m going to come up with my mother and Brilliant .
I grew up as a single child of faith in my life .
It was a little bit silly in the 1970s .
My family was a large family , who grew up in our village , where I grew up in my mother , and I grew up with my mother .
I grew up in fact , and I grew up in the world of two women .
It was my mother , the world of war , the world , and the name of the world .
On the other hand , the religious , religious , fewer or fewer , was my tradition .
And what I was saying was that he was looking at the face of his wife and his wife , and he was amazed to make a different pattern .
They were sad , people who live in their village , people who live in their village .
And every time I was my tradition , my tradition of my tradition , the number of girls who were forced to get us out of the number of girls who were going to get us up .
Then one of them would go to the block .
And one of them came to visit the next week .
And I know that so much of my eldest hand , and a war in which there might be a witness , and I know that there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to come up with a lot of them , and that &apos;s not what people have been worried about , and that &apos;s not what people are worried about .
So I asked my grandmother to figure out what it did ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , we have a lot of people , but the power of our main organizations . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons . &quot; &quot; And in my hand , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons , if you want to have no idea , if you want to have no idea , you want to get it , you want to get it up .
It &apos;s in the rubble of the economy .
Each one of us is now , and we are now on social and perfections .
We &apos;re all about it .
We &apos;re born in a certain family , and we &apos;re born in a certain family .
But if you don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know if you can &apos;t interact with the world that we &apos;re talking about in a world with a remote world .
We can get rid of the energy , and the hope is that we have a very long time in the world .
Our friends , our partners , our colleagues , our family , our family , our family , and we are very similar to ourselves .
In Turkey , like my tradition , the women are doing something like this , which is a little bit like a flash of light , or the sad part of the day — to the bottom .
And it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of faith in the belief that a person exists , and a lot of people are looking at their appearance .
It &apos;s one of the great safety of our world , but it &apos;s one of the biggest security struggles in our world .
And there &apos;s a place where there &apos;s all sorts of places , and liberals and women , and they &apos;re religious , and they &apos;re gay , and they &apos;re gay , and there &apos;s a lot of faith .
And then , in the form of these things , and the kinds of things that are in the form of these kinds of things , and the kinds of things .
Now , my writing is , in my mind , is the key to the carrots vaccinate .
Now , when the calculations may not be dispersed , then we can open up the lines in our mind .
And so looking at all of these things , and we can enjoy what we see .
I started writing stories from eight .
My mother gave me the verb , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s a very good idea to write my stories .
Now , I think it &apos;s the time that I think it &apos;s at the time that I think it &apos;s very rare .
My parents were good at home , but I was really good at telling stories of these stories of friends .
I was a kid who was going to be amazed , and I was an inattractive kid who would have been amazed , and I was an inattractive kid , and I was an inattractive kid , and my mother would have thought to be a good idea .
But he didn &apos;t know that my life was already more than the matter of my life , and I wanted to say that I wanted to write about my life .
And I started to write about it , and I started writing about some of the things that were about them .
So , like this , I started to write this way .
I was amazed by the stories of some of the most amazing things that were in the popular Bible .
Give me a little bit : I &apos;m going to tell you about my life .
This one has led to another cooker .
My mom became a certificate .
And I was at the same time , and I went through the middle of this small , middle class , and I fell into the middle of the city , and I was the only species in the school .
I fell out of the very first time to be a typical foreign word , like &quot; &quot; typical foreign &quot; &quot; — all the miles from all of the miles , but this is what you &apos;re looking at when you see how the classroom was going to be in the classroom .
In fact , these kids have been regarded as their own personal identity , not their themselves , but they were regarded as much as they did .
We &apos;ve been amazed to the United Nations , and it was fun , and it &apos;s alien , and it &apos;s outside , and it &apos;s hidden in the name of a filthy event , and it &apos;s outside of religion .
And as I was like this , as young as I would like to love , she &apos;d always hurt .
And so it turns out that when I was in this school , when I was in this school , it became the letter A , and it blew up , and it blew up , and it turned out to be a fake .
( Laughter ) I spent time on the time of my life , and my thesis was to be married to be married .
I saw the first time in this room for the first time .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; Midly Expresas Exracos . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They asked him to ask me , &quot; &quot; You know , they &apos;ve asked me , &quot; &quot; they asked me to throw my head out of the way .
And I learned about three strings of the triangle , and this is what it was like : the black side and the conquest .
And after the Spaniards , we went back to Ahi and We returned to Angelir .
I think I could have thought that my news and my stories can be transformed by myself , and that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do with myself .
And the elders gave me a sense of my litigation , my litigation , of my litigation — and I was able to figure out how I was going .
I loved the Istanbul that I love 20 years old .
I lived in a very literal and alive world , and I wrote a little bit about my novel .
I was there in the eighteenth year .
And I had to know what I &apos;d seen when I was talking about three more than three .
He had a shareholder , and he had to sell a drink in his shop , and he would not mentor with anyone who was talking about the scripting and marches .
It took a long long time in his head , and he was sitting in front of his eyes .
And I saw him in my head , and I saw him in my head , and I saw him in my head , and I &apos;d like to show him in my mind , and that &apos;s what I think about , in fact , is that the transgender side of this network is in a network of translucent relationships .
And when we have a world of Death and the cliffs , we have an experience that we have , and we have a few hours .
And I &apos;ve always convinced that there was a way to read stories .
I don &apos;t want you to know that there &apos;s a very good bet , but I don &apos;t want you to know a good novel , and it gets away from us , and it gets away from us , and sometimes we start to recognize the people we &apos;re not talking about .
And then I went out of the incident of my life , and then I went to college and I went to college .
It was not only about geographic ; it was a complete change in language .
I started writing English .
I think the cursor , the cursor , the size of my English writing , the reason why I didn &apos;t write in English , and the reason I was trying to change is because of the change .
I just like writing in Turkish , I write like I write in English , and I like writing in English , and I think it &apos;s more like calculus and I think .
I think it &apos;s all sorts of other kinds of connections .
And the people in the world , who are the millions of people in the world , who are able to study it later .
Which is when you teach at the moment , when you learn that later , when you have to lose it .
And then , as we don &apos;t know , we want to make better words , and we want to make better words , we want to make better things , like , because our brain and language are big .
This is a difference .
But if we learn from it , it can be style of style .
This was what I found in Bostonica — the mountains of living and uninhabited style .
I could go back to my own tradition of my own faith in my life , and I could go to my visit to my visit , and I &apos;d been amazed at the time , and then I could go somewhere , and then I could go somewhere , and I could go somewhere .
My mother liked my own life .
( Laughter ) But I went to try to decide where I decide to decide .
And so I began to come up with the aucarace of Arizona , which is why I couldn &apos;t feel much more than two points in the world .
My part of my piece is always a grave , and I &apos;m a piece of music , and I &apos;m a piece of music .
I think my stories , I think , is always my stories of my stories .
And I think it &apos;s my idea that when you connect the story more deeply , it loses its own voice .
I &apos;d like to think about it with you .
One of the images that I wrote in English was one of the words of literature , and one of the things that I wrote in English was this one .
He said , &quot; &quot; I like the book . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; You could write a little differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked what he meant .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you look at your hand , there &apos;s plenty of people , there &apos;s a lot of statistics , American , American , but there &apos;s only Turkey , but there &apos;s only Turkey who is going to be a college . &quot; &quot; Well , it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of women who are going to see what it means to me .
But I know that I continue to continue to make it happen .
He wanted to be a friend of mine .
He wanted it to be a book , which was a book called a book .
We all know about the world of stories , and we can see the stories of the story , and we can see the stories of the story , and we can see that in the beginning of the story .
We don &apos;t have the software , particularly the writers who are not at all .
If you &apos;re in the Islamic world , the woman who &apos;s in Islam is waiting for you to write about Islam as well as the Islamic name of Islam , which is better than the woman .
They &apos;re looking forward to the way that you can write the typical typical stories of the 20th century , and they &apos;re waiting for you to go away .
And in matter of matter , my goodness , my surprise is that the world exists in literature .
The software of the software is not like the creative people who have their ideas , but they seem to look like a bunch of authors and countries of their community .
It &apos;s not the difference of our anger , but they &apos;re waiting for our culture .
In 1986 , the writer and the 13th , James Baldsson asked her about homosexuality , and they asked him about homosexuality .
The people who took the hardware , the blue writer , was trying to find him as a blue writer , and he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have anything else ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have anything else in it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When politics is , the idea is that we have no idea .
There &apos;s a tremendous cathedral of literature that all of you who have not seen from women in black .
Ten years ago , 10 years ago , I was very good at all .
We were three printers , and one of the manifestations of the FIlippe , one of the Inuit , the Indonyonian , the country .
( Laughter ) But there was no idea of literature , and there was no idea of literature .
We were alone .
They &apos;re waiting for the writing stories about the stories of the Bible .
It &apos;s a cession .
It &apos;s not just a lone nut , they become the explorers of the Sun .
And I &apos;m trying to make sure that it doesn &apos;t exist , and it doesn &apos;t exist .
All around the world .
I saw this in the first time in 2005th year in August in 2005 .
And I was working , and I was working with the eyes of the women of women and family , and I was writing a lot of my friends .
And it turned out that my little story became a big macro-problem .
I wrote about the &quot; &quot; Turkish , &quot; &quot; and I write about the kind of thing that I wrote about , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m amazed .
But I &apos;d like to tell you all two things that are just about numbers .
Just a story .
I don &apos;t want to reduce the definition of what I &apos;m talking about , and I don &apos;t want to reduce it .
And so I like to see how life works , and I &apos;m sorry .
They &apos;re known to see the writings , and the political books of the political books are not the language of literature .
And so , like , &quot; &quot; Well , the truth of the matter is that the truth of the truth and the truth is , &quot; &quot; I have a good understanding of the truth .
And it &apos;s a piece of art . &quot; &quot; The politics of politics separate us from each other .
One of them is that it makes it .
They &apos;re very likely to come up .
One is a border .
Strip &apos;s meeting .
The Black Sea is made out of a great deal .
It &apos;s water .
There was a story that was called &quot; &quot; eureka , &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; eureka , &quot; &quot; where they were very time-consuming stories of people who were very often very likely to go .
They change the way that they vibrate in different forms of different patterns on the stage .
He went to listen to him , and people , who are the Muslims , who are the Muslims , who are not rational .
Ladies and gentlemen , the middle of the Middle East , the Central Africa , the Bond and the Banela Nannies .
And stories today are continuing to continue .
The Palestinian and Israeli Brandi and the Israelites can &apos;t wake up each other , but it seems to be a Palestinian person who looks like an indescribated writer , and it &apos;s going to be connected to the end of the story .
You have to take us further away .
And if it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s not good .
The book is — and the kid who was going to be very attentive and felt .
But there &apos;s also the security of the book .
And then the software and the Sufi soul , who came up with the sign of the Scandinese , had to make sure that the first thing that happened to you was that the first job of the Scandin &apos;s books had to go into the water .
To the Sugons , &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t see that you can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And the problem today is that we don &apos;t see the problem of ghettos , and the problem today is not limited to any of us , but we know more about it , we know that we know that we know that we know , we &apos;re more likely to know , we &apos;re more likely to know .
I love it : living in the motion of the computer .
One of the top of the world is fixed .
And the other hand is a perpetual rule , and the third beat .
And I &apos;m in my eyes .
It &apos;s a part of the mountains that I wrote in the summer of Istanburement , and the other part is , the other part of the world is connected to the world .
And I think it &apos;s an opening , and it &apos;s a university , and it &apos;s also the belief that they belong to a university .
You see , you see , you see the meeting with Istanburement , you see the meeting of 1400 years of Oanger .
And there &apos;s a place called &quot; &quot; Agribe , &quot; &quot; and there &apos;s a place called &quot; &quot; Avish . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a place called a view .
That place is among the buildings of buildings .
I really like this slide .
We don &apos;t believe in the fact that we don &apos;t believe in the world .
We &apos;re making sure that the people who are committed to be dictated by the exhalan-free experience of living and change in the world are defined as iconic .
And I think it should be the objective of artists who are looking at things .
I &apos;m going to write in the world , and most of the time , I &apos;m gay .
And I love to think about 10 proof post-ups .
And I like to love my anger .
I can write about the women of my Romania and write about women &apos;s women , and it &apos;s going to be a woman who &apos;s going to be a great miserable man .
We can write about everything we can write about .
Audo Lord says , &quot; &quot; Our clever ancestors says , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean .
And I don &apos;t realize that , why don &apos;t we even learn how to write about the script that you &apos;ve seen in the world .
It &apos;s not very good for this .
It &apos;s not based on what we &apos;re doing , what we know , what we know and how everyone is .
We teach stories about how they felt .
We have to know the stories , we have to recognize other worlds .
And it &apos;s like the nest entrance , like the nest entrance .
And yet , even though it &apos;s not hanging from the state of state , it &apos;s very clear .
And I would end up with the assassination accused , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , we &apos;re happy , we &apos;ll be friends , we &apos;re happy ; forget about the world . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And my big idea is that there &apos;s a little bit of an idea that &apos;s going to get rid of the secret .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s a woman who belongs to an A , and here are the women who belong .
They are women .
And I was quite amazed by the Sun .
Two years ago , I &apos;ve lost my grandfather .
It was my father &apos;s shirt , and I was running out of the right , five months .
And I started to realize that this is the time .
I &apos;ve been looking at my life , and I &apos;ve been talking about my peers , and I can tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re not kinder , you know , that &apos;s the only way you have to be more .
( Applause ) We &apos;re going to have a world of women &apos;s women .
We &apos;ll be very similar to the very core of the word .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And it &apos;s because it &apos;s very rare , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s very rare .
And as recently as a man , he started talking about it , and he started talking about it at night .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not saying — &quot; &quot; You know , you know .
If it was five hours of space , it would be more interesting ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They &apos;ve invested less of the males less .
So this is what I think you want to do with this particular question , if you want to eat it all , and you want to eat it , &quot; &quot; If you want to eat it ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You know , they &apos;re going to be a little tennier , but no one , you know , play a little bit , say , &quot; &quot; Well , they &apos;ve been able to do it , but they &apos;re not always , because the leaders who are trying
Increasingly , you have an I.D. .
It &apos;s not to be a good leader , but it &apos;s not going to be a good leader .
It &apos;s very difficult to see the Titanic .
I think Lehman Brands , who were not Lehman Brothers , were still married , and they were still married .
( Applause ) When Garders are seven hours old , seven hours , seven hours , seven hours , seven hours , seven hours , and maybe they could see it .
One of the great things that we &apos;re dealing with is the very good thing for our authenticity , which is the best good for our authenticity , but to the extent to our life that we live in , and what &apos;s good for us .
And I hope that you can see the power of the night in which you have to see the great ideas in your wake , to see the power of the night .
Thank you very much .

My husband &apos;s brain disease is a disease .
What &apos;s the problem ?
Dr. Francesca Bennmen .
They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve been considered to be considered normal to be considered .
I found that in my brain , I found that there was a disease .
I was like a kid with a body of women who had no idea .
If you can imagine the brain , the brain is related to the number two .
It &apos;s a part of the honor to honor .
The parallel works is parallel processing .
It &apos;s been consolidated .
And how do you think about things differently , and they eat things differently .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . ( Applause )
And the right brain is a picture of the motion of our bodies .
Now , the way that you get to the energy of the energy , the way that you see how the Earth looks like , how it feels and how they felt , how they felt and how they felt , how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they
It &apos;s an energy in which we can connect with the skin of the right brain .
And we &apos;re at the point , and it &apos;s very precise .
And our left brain is an entirely different place .
And the left of the left is thinking .
And the left is that the way to get the information out of it , and the way it &apos;s special about it .
And the left is thinking about language .
The mountain world is connected to our world outside of our world .
This is us : &quot; &quot; If you have to go back and get your banjo .
And when he says he &apos;s supposed to throw it out .
And so , I was a job . I started making urine .
From the fact that the word &quot; &quot; eureka , &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s not a matter of truth .
I feel slowly , slowly , slowly .
And when I was trying to get a shower in the dining room , when you &apos;re trying to get a shower in the hotel .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;ve heard about the answer .
I can &apos;t see it with the atoms and molecules inside the inside .
The only thing I could feel was a foreign energy , and it was strong .
I said , &quot; &quot; What happened to me ?
All of my work is all about my work , and all of my work together , and all of my work together , and all of my work together , and all of my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all of my life , and all my work together , and all my work together , and
I think I can &apos;t hear it . ( Applause )
Bring it out to the front of your eye .
It felt the eyes .
And my left brain is back to my left .
And I &apos;m right at that moment .
And then the brain is saying , &quot; &quot; Huh !
( Laughter ) And then he comes to my crying , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have time to have time . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have time to leave .
I need to call it a village , I &apos;m trying to get a job .
I try to call it .
And I go back and forth , and I go back and forth .
So one of the reasons that I &apos;ve been trying to do this is because I &apos;ve come up with my mind .
I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about the Golden Buy Rider .
And so I had some identity and my life and my life .
And my brain , between two and two , between two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the other realities .
How is it that it &apos;s a great moment , how is it that it &apos;s a great honor ?
And I &apos;ll be able to unite alone .
And if we choose to speak in the very right brain .
