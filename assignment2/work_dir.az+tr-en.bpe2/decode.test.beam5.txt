I &apos;m going to talk today about invisible exploration .
So I &apos;m working in the solar technology .
And my little bit of a little bit of my time is to throw it into power , and then ...
So let &apos;s look at different mirrors .
This is just a little video about what we &apos;re doing .
A minute .
It can be a little bit higher .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) We just — this part of the piece — my part of the piece of the piece — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s my part of the piece . ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) That &apos;s not . ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The Sun &apos;s technology .
Oh , what was time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
And I &apos;d like to urge you to notice .
So , after a few minutes , let &apos;s go back to this . I hope that if you learn how to do it in less than just a few minutes , you can change your life very well .
We &apos;re very interested in language , particularly in particular , about their language .
The different lines of different lines are more interesting : ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s a very simple thing to do .
Narrator : They get to the 10 neutral house .
This is the lucky policeman of America .
And the head is miserable — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re going to fall away . We consume ourselves .
We &apos;re inside .
We &apos;re trying to be invisible to the guy in the world .
As you can see , there &apos;s animals and people do the same thing .
And it turns out that there &apos;s no power and strength in this .
And when you get older , we tend to complete their gestures of their gestures .
So , if you &apos;re willing to pile up against us , then we &apos;re trying to pile up , we &apos;re trying to pile up .
In contrast , we become the glue .
Do you know what ?
And I found that there &apos;s lots of gestures in the middle of the MBA , even in many numbers .
They &apos;re talking about them as a leader , and when they go into the classroom , in the middle of the warehouse , they live in the middle of the room , where they &apos;re still in the middle of the room .
They &apos;re sitting in the middle of the second with little tea .
They just put their hands away .
They &apos;re invisible .
They &apos;re angry like they &apos;re sitting , and they lay their hands .
I was just a few answers .
The first one is probably not going to happen .
And then , it &apos;s very dependent on sexual .
So the women are often more likely to get to this law .
Girls often feel more hopeful than men , and that &apos;s not the result .
And it &apos;s a place where there &apos;s no matter .
And it &apos;s very important for the MBA , because they have an impact on their narrative .
We have to find a lot of women who are going to deal with a conflict of ties .
And the people who are ready to prepare , and women are at the end of women , and they &apos;re looking at different boats .
And I started thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve started to think that the flies are more active in the way .
And if you want to take these videos , they &apos;re going to be able to get more active , and they will be more active ?
And if we were able to do it very much , it wouldn &apos;t have existed .
So if we can make it strong , we can feel much more powerful within our behavior , that we can feel more powerful than the outcome of our behavior ?
And then we know that our joggers and our uncles and our aunts liked their way to think about us .
But the question that makes us fascinating is that you can &apos;t do it , and that &apos;s what we do .
And yet , we &apos;re not going to shake it in the classroom , and we &apos;re not going to smile .
And that &apos;s all the things that have come true .
It &apos;s also about power .
We tend to be able to change the way we feel and feel more hopeful , and we tend to get stronger in the gestures we try to make .
It doesn &apos;t change our ability to change our ability to think about our behavior , but to change our behavior .
I mean , from the perspective of power , what do I think ?
And the idea is , I &apos;m talking about the physics , and I &apos;m also talking about the physics of physics , and I &apos;m also talking about these hormones .
What &apos;s the question to think about as well ?
It &apos;s not surprising , it &apos;s not surprising .
And we say to them , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , &quot; &quot; and you know .
And we give them a choice , and we can guide them .
They selected the gammac game , which is the game game .
And it &apos;s about 60 percent of the power of power , but it &apos;s very important .
And this is what you &apos;re doing at the test .
In the test scores , 20 percent increase in the test of my own experience , which is 20 percent increase in the test .
It happens to be a matter of two to two minutes .
And they &apos;re in Korean .
It &apos;s about 25 percent , and there &apos;s about 25 percent increase in cortical areas , and there &apos;s about 15 percent .
And the two minutes of this is that our brains can &apos;t feel that our brains are more ambitious , more comfortable , or stressed or stressed .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re all meeting with , right ?
We have to think about how we think about how we think about ourselves and how we feel .
And we think about it differently .
And the other question that makes us interesting is that we can take a few minutes of a moment to change the way that our life can change .
This is a joint equisite in the maze .
How do you make it in the way ?
Of course , that &apos;s what makes us interesting .
We can be used to be leveraged by the ability to connect against social capital .
Are there a lot of things wrong ?
This is the nest entrance table .
Some of them are meeting teachers .
Some of them are coming up , or it &apos;s like a business interview .
And so we &apos;ve got ideas that are making lots and lots of jobs , because many of you have been interested in your life .
So we were successful , and meditation pushed them wide , and they said , &quot; &quot; Why should we do it ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we deny this idea . No , no , no , no idea .
You &apos;re not doing it .
It &apos;s not like you know .
It &apos;s about three .
What do you do before the interview started ?
You sit down . You &apos;re looking at the needle and you listen .
You &apos;re looking at things , calculus , you collect calculus , you collect your essence , which is , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do . It &apos;s just like you &apos;re sitting on the feet .
That &apos;s what we wanted to do .
And then when the myriad of the monks and their strength and strength and strength and strength , they had a very large business interview .
He had a video that had five minutes .
They were teaching them to not use their intelligence to do it , but they were not allowed to do themselves in their own way . They looked like this .
In five minutes , it &apos;s more likely to be worse than whether it &apos;s protected , but five minutes .
Nobody likes it .
Now , Maranan Lauria call it &quot; &quot; social media . &quot; &quot; And this is the increase in humanism .
We had to see them from one of the interview themselves .
Then we showed up , we showed up on the set of marks .
They were unaware of the things that we were looking for .
They didn &apos;t know who they took , and then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to work . &quot; &quot; And then they showed up , &quot; &quot; We want to take them to work .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to take that .
And they &apos;re more positioning about it . &quot; &quot; And why is it that makes it effect ?
It &apos;s not their performance .
Their gender depend on their hands .
And we looked at the other show , and for example , the degrees of nitrogen is how fast it is ?
Who has the luxury of it ?
There was no difference in this .
The thing that &apos;s important is that it was not just the same .
People who showed themselves the real opposite .
So they put their themselves together .
They had no effect , they showed themselves .
And this is what happens .
And when I said to people , we think about our behavior , we think about our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , but they say , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that just staying there ?
I &apos;m talking to you about the point of truth .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not like this .
And I don &apos;t want to feel what I &apos;m going to do .
I don &apos;t want to be a journalist .
I don &apos;t want to be where I don &apos;t belong .
I &apos;m trying to get it very good . I &apos;d like to tell you a little story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my place . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to talk about a little story .
At the age of 19 , I had a very heavy courtyard .
They &apos;re surrounded by desert .
I was translated around a few times .
I was impressed by the way , and I had to go out of the brain , and I was trying to go out the college , and I remember the answer , which is very painful for me .
I was in my name , because I was known as a kid who was eager to be a kid .
And so , I tried to go back from college , to come back .
They told me , &quot; &quot; You won &apos;t be finished .
And it &apos;s a lot of things that you can do with it , but they said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , that &apos;s your fundamental property that you have to have , you know , you know .
I felt like I was completely immersed .
I used to work , I worked , and I was working on my own , and I was making my work .
I ended up drawing .
I had to go and spend four years of time , and I was willing to go ahead and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been willing to go . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Where I ain &apos;t bored . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Where I ain &apos;t bored .
I was tired .
The first one of the reasons why 20 seconds is the first one I had to say about 20 different differences in Princeton .
I could avoid it .
And so I became afraid of the morning , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And he told me , &quot; &quot; No , you won &apos;t . &quot;
And then , you will , and you &apos;ll go away and say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to get a girl .
Or even though .
You &apos;re going to have to do it all the way .
And yet , you know , again , when you &apos;re scared , you &apos;re afraid , like , you know , like , &quot; &quot; Ah , it &apos;s been taken away . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Ah , I &apos;ve been taken away ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
It &apos;s actually coming from my head . &quot; &quot; And so I did this .
I read five years of high school high school , and I think it &apos;s a few years old , I &apos;m in my home , I &apos;m in my home , I &apos;m working there , I &apos;m working there , I &apos;m working there . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think about it for a long time .
And at the end of the first year , I was a student , and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not supposed to be involved in your class , you &apos;re going to wipe it up , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to wipe it out . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know him very well .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not my place . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; I don &apos;t belong to my place . &quot;
This was the point to me .
Because two things happened .
I realized that I don &apos;t have that feeling yet .
But he felt and felt like that .
And secondly , I didn &apos;t understand that it was right .
So it could be able to make it work .
And I said to him : &quot; &quot; No , you know .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you that there &apos;s a lot of the essence of the core , and it will show the core of the core , and you &apos;ll let go of the very best , and you &apos;ll let go of the best , and that &apos;s what it happened to you . ( Laughter ) A few months later , he was raised to me . ( Laughter ) A few months later , he came up to me , and I saw how much it was .
It was changed .
So I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you ,
Invest as much as possible .
Think about it as much as you want to know .
You know .
And it can make a lot of changes such as possible .
Now , that &apos;s two minutes ago .
Two minutes , two straight , two .
So , if you &apos;re going to get a promotion , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the kitchen , in the kitchen , in the kitchen , or the table .
Get your hand up .
Do you root your brain in your brain .
You increase your sanitation .
I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell them that I was a girl . I couldn &apos;t tell them what I &apos;m wrong with . &quot;
You see , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m telling them who I am . &quot; &quot; You go away .
And I &apos;d like to leave you with you , and I &apos;d like to tell you about it , because it &apos;s very rare .
It &apos;s not the experience . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So this is what you &apos;ve learned and you &apos;re meeting with people , because people who have been able to benefit from this kind of technology , and they &apos;re not necessarily static , no matter how static technology can &apos;t be .
You can get it to them .
Because the third thing is , they can make it very important for their survival .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have very clear gestures in the world .
And the most part of their superpowers are invisible .
Their materials are the ones that are committed to live , and they are the ones that are used to live .
They made a cluster of garments that blew up from the conflict of conflicts of conflict .
The continents are all about the heavy , honest and necessary job of all benefit , but it doesn &apos;t thank them for them .
Here , in Brazil , there &apos;s 90 percent of the products of the products that are coming up in Brazil .
Most of the victims are employed , and there &apos;s a lot of them coming out of the road , and they &apos;re going to be recycled .
It &apos;s a few of Cartresses , and they &apos;re ready to get out of metal , or the cars that are ready to get out of metal , or maybe they are the car .
This is why I &apos;ve never met the reason that I &apos;ve ever been meeting with his fellowship .
I &apos;m a graffiti artist and an activist , and I &apos;m not sure what I &apos;m talking about , and that &apos;s the issue of the world .
In 2005 , I turned to the squares of my work in the world .
But I &apos;d like to support my catalog .
And my work and the myriad of my work was more and more attention than my work .
These days , the press and social meditation are played in the press .
And it &apos;s true that I &apos;ve been working with this world that I &apos;ve been working with this world .
And I was in a lot of other squares , and I was coloring in a lot of other places in the world .
And I came to find that they were not only Brasilia , the cataloilks of not only Brasilia .
And in the Arctic , in China , in China , in China , I ended up in Africa , and even in the country , in the country .
I realized that there was more to me than that , because it was a big job .
And then I created a movement under my shirt , &quot; &quot; Carum &apos;s eyes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I created a movement under the title of this .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; Cardonism , &quot; &quot; that was a very large movement that was created by the way to which I was creative .
And they agreed to support their dreams , supervisas , hair , hair , hair , hairy boards , and they agreed to be known by governments , and they agreed to be known .
And while we were to be judged by our cartresses , our carrots and villages to see them , they gave them a very good place to see the world .
They would have been given other foundations for corruption : the fact that they are transmitters and laugh .
And finally , they would have been this magnificent and big journey , and they would be part of the great journey .
&quot; &quot; Cardonism , &quot; &quot; Sao Paulo , Rio de Jano and Kurie .
But we created the Pramppx of the city , where we created the Phimhix , which is the theory of the city , and we created the Phimhix , which has been made by the Sun .
So he could have a ham .
In two years , 170 catalog , 800 miles , 800 miles , and over 100,000 years , and over 100,000 years , &quot; &quot; Carum &apos;s eyes are &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Cardonism , &quot; &quot; they were moving in the local schools .
And they would have been the people who are looking at it , and they would have been given the people who are being respected and respected .
They could come in from their observable cards , their income and their relationships .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you about the catalogs and the invisible strengths in your pocket , and I &apos;m calling you .
Try to see the world without borders , and there &apos;s a whole thing .
No , no , there &apos;s more than 20 million people in the world .
You can see one of the things that you see when you see one part of our community .
Thank you , thank you .
( Applause )
In October 5 seconds , in 1990 , in the 1970s , in Manhraib , in the hotel , in Manhraib , in the hotel , the Prime Minister of Libya County was assassinated by the leader .
The first great reason is that it had been eradicated from the very nature ceremony , and yet , when they cross the road , they were set up in the middle of the community , and then they set up their plans for the other type of advice : tunnels , synesthetic , and the head of the BMTon &apos;s head .
And the plans of the plantiveness of the FTB was at the top .
But in 1993 , 1993 , in 1993 , the World Trade Center , it didn &apos;t know if it was a bomb .
And in the end of the moment , Nosair is defined by hand .
It &apos;s my father &apos;s father .
And in 1986 , I gave the world an image of him in the University of Penn , in the U.K. — and I gave the world an image of an architect who had been honored to be a kid .
And then my family , after dinner , started to change in our family .
I didn &apos;t have to realize that the very few people had noticed that very few people had noticed very few people .
And I &apos;ve been able to study them from my experience : when people have been hearing one of them , then we don &apos;t realize that each one of us has a very long time to understand that they have their lives .
In every single religion , you can get to the people who are struggling to believe in each nation , and others have to come up with a little bit of the people who are struggling to drag them into their lives .
A few months ago , a couple of weeks ago , he told me about a couple of weeks ago , and he told me about a few weeks ago , and he told me about a few weeks ago .
And I &apos;d like to tell you about it .
We landed on the heart of the FTBa , and we didn &apos;t know it was in the time of FTBa &apos;s hidden observer .
And he was trying to hold my head in the mud , and he was trying to keep me thinking , &quot; &quot; Tell me how to shake it .
And the last laugh I &apos;ve been throwing away is the little bit of a little bit on the surface of the day , and the result was that there was startup , and I think that &apos;s what I think .
My wife came back to the other side of the &quot; &quot; Agren &apos;t &quot; &quot; — Arabic &apos;s a little bit .
And the word &quot; &quot; eureka laughs , &quot; &quot; but a few years later I figured out how they shop .
They felt that my father had existed .
And the result is that these are 700 of the women who were fully known by 700 parts of the World Trade Center , where the World Trade Center of The World Trade Center went through 700 and more people in the world .
These people are taking care of myself and devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was calling . &quot; &quot; People .
When I was 35 years old , I changed the way that my kids drove 20 years , and I became a little bit of a young child .
And some of us would have noticed that we were hungry , and we would have another bird .
And I was always a new one of the time , as a new picture of kids .
And I was able to keep my suffering from my kids , but it turns out that there was a very good thing , and it was clear that you had to have the highest number of people in the world .
So this is why I spent a lot of time reading the book , and I spent a lot of time reading the book .
This is why I had conflicts in a community of social capital , and I was not prepared to be prepared for life .
I grew up in a facility where people were trying to see whether or religion like religion and religion .
So what led my eyes ?
One of my first experiments came to think about this kind of thinking about the year 2000 or the year 2000 .
And I was able to make my college work at the National Guard Convention on the National Guard Convention .
And I was sitting in my pocket , and I was standing on the street , and I was standing on the street , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t belong to any of the things that were in the world .
It was the people who had the harms of our women .
And I found that one of the kids that I grew up in their recent days was one of their kids .
This is a remarkable few days , but I realized that there was no enemy at all , but I realized that there was no enemy .
He had not been a friend of mine , and I &apos;d like to tell her right away , and I &apos;d like to have a sense of proud of my life that I had to know that my life was invisible to me .
And one of my great favorites is that I found the work that I found in the summer of the summer of Bumbleich , where I find the work that I found .
I was a very diverse group of people who had a lot of faith , and this experience of experience , and this experience .
I had to teach a very large part of my life , and I was teaching a story that all sorts of deer .
It took it up to work , and I had been able to work in one of them , and I &apos;ve been able to work in one of them , and there &apos;s a lot of people who are most likely to go out of their lives .
I had love .
And I would like to do that with my kids that I would teach a child with stereotypical types of stereotypical types of stereotypical experiences .
I was unaware of how you had a sense of how you had a sense of how it was there , but it was very good for you to know what was going on .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; And I had to be honest with myself that I had to be honest with myself , and I had to be honest with myself , and I was able to teach myself that the moral and religious nature of the people had helped me .
In the famous part of the word , I had been able to throw it back in the famous principle of the dictionary .
And the inspiration came out of the place , and I was really interested in the realization that my worldview was more positioned to my worldview , and it didn &apos;t come in the park .
One day I was talking about my day , my mother &apos;s worldview , and my mother told me a word that I couldn &apos;t take away from my life .
He looked at me and he looked at his eyes , and he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking at people . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking at people .
And I figured out how much I had to tell you about all of a sudden .
My Zak Ebrame isn &apos;t a step .
And I started to change the way that I had to start my suffering with my patriarchy .
Why did I get to the security ?
It &apos;s very clear .
And I hope that one of those moments , perhaps , is that someone who seems to have heard my story , and I think that &apos;s what happens to me , and I think that &apos;s the moment that I didn &apos;t have any fanatics .
When I was , I &apos;ve chosen to use my life as a tool for my life , my life , my life .
Thank you very much , and I &apos;m going to try and push it out and push them up .
And I &apos;m going to try and do this because I &apos;m going to try and see if I don &apos;t think about any kind of otherism .
And as a simple example of my religion , I am living in a living place where I &apos;m not afraid , and I &apos;m alive , and I &apos;m living in the way that my son has to go through the road .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m sleeping . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in the morning .
Without it ?
They took a step on a step . But I wanted to ask you to ask me , &quot; &quot; Why is it written in Arabic ? &quot;
Who ? Anybody ? Well , there &apos;s no problem .
Recently , one day , I sat in my restaurant , and I had dinner .
I looked at the office and said , &quot; You know , you know ? ( Applause )
He looked very strange to me thinking about the word wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The French graduate , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; French graduate .
He said , &quot; &quot; Great , you &apos;re going to do it ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Wow , you know .
He was a good color , and he would say , &quot; &quot; If you have the number of people in this world , then I didn &apos;t look at it . &quot; &quot; And if you were the number of the poorest in the world .
What do you mean in the words &quot; &quot; Menu &quot; &quot; ?
He was a Liberian boy who &apos;d been a Liberian man , and he had a little bit like the window .
How about that kind of diagram ?
I started thinking .
This blew me up .
This is really good to see .
And in fact , in my own country , it &apos;s not because I think it &apos;s in their own way .
Is it possible ?
How is it that we have to see ?
But there &apos;s really a lot of people here , like me , who are in their lives , and they &apos;ve always been in their lives , and they &apos;re not just paying attention to anything that they &apos;ve ever done .
Have I ever forget about my entire anger , my ideas , my anger , my cry ?
Our kids could have the best idea of the world .
What I found in Arabic is that it &apos;s not just to fit everything .
Should I forget to be one of them ?
Did it be here ?
And yet , I tried to figure it out .
And I didn &apos;t want it to be the proud of the real world .
It doesn &apos;t answer the students of the day .
It &apos;s not the language of science , and it &apos;s not the language of exploration , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used to , and it &apos;s not the language that we used to deal with , and it &apos;s not the language that we used to use in the air .
If we were like this , they stopped our palm .
Now , what do I have to use ? We have to have that supreme !
We want you to use the Arabic language . Should we use it ?
This is a reality .
But there &apos;s another reality that we have to think about .
It &apos;s a moment of language .
It says that if you &apos;re in December , you have to be compassionate in your master &apos;s master to know .
In the main language of liberal language , it &apos;s really hard to express their ideas .
Huh ?
And the first time that device is used to write the first time in the first summer .
The whole idea of all of the ideas , the imagination and the brilliance of it , had been dominated by small boys in the village .
So on the end of the English writing , he had enough press .
In fact , when you hear his writing in Arabic , in Arabic , at the summer of English , you have that feeling .
You can imagine that you can imagine , in the English language that says , &quot; &quot; Wow , that boy is in Arabic .
This is a myth that I don &apos;t have to feel .
Second , it says that if you wanted to kill one mile , the only way to kill the nation is to kill its tongue .
This is a reality where the community knows what it is .
In the Germans , the bristles , they , the grass , these nations .
So they &apos;re not allowed to protect their language .
They &apos;re looking at it .
And so they use a lot of money to use language to improve language .
How do we know more ?
Well , what we developed out of the developed world , which is that we had to come up with this opportunity , and we &apos;d like to stay with the world .
Once upon us , they were able to come up with the fact that there were countries like us who were in the countries of the country , where they were able to come up with a number of women , like Mickaya and so on and so on and so forth .
They hold language to their language .
Because if you get a product in Turkey , or if you get a product out of it , and you don &apos;t have a little sticker , it &apos;s not the local product .
You couldn &apos;t believe it was the local product .
They &apos;ve been translucent like that , and they &apos;re unskilled as much as they are .
So they were able to innovate and be allowed to innovate .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what &apos;s going on in Arabic ?
It doesn &apos;t remind you of anything , right ?
It doesn &apos;t matter how and why .
Language is not just the promise of the words from our mouth , but it &apos;s not the promise to be afraid .
The terminology of our life , which is based on our command and our insecurities , is the terminology .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; when you say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; you have a special picture of every one of you in a special day , special history .
Language is not one or two or three or three words .
It &apos;s an idealized idea of how to think about how we think about how our thinking , how we see each other , and how they see us .
What &apos;s the unified graph ?
And you can say , well , this is a human being , not ?
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Amondtizing , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Aunt , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re not going to be a son , &quot; &quot; and if you were a son , &quot; &quot; Aw , you &apos;re going to die ?
What did you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , I go out and go home .
This is what it means to say that these things are special to us .
There &apos;s a friend who is married to me .
So one day I asked her about the job ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; But I was trying to quote one day , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been working . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So the author of the author , I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The software woman was trying to explain to him .
He was raised to himself , and he said , &quot; &quot; How much would you have ?
He wants suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the press ? &quot; &quot; This is one of a few miles from a few .
And so we started thinking this way to think about it , because the women can &apos;t say that the woman is , and it &apos;s okay to deal with that .
Everyone told me , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I was trying to go , &quot; &quot; I was trying to go , &quot; &quot; I was trying to go back to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; If I listen to her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to go out and unveil this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And this is the problem , which is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve passed my hands , and I drove my hand . &quot; &quot;
Let &apos;s reassure this .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We &apos;ve been able to translator , and we &apos;ve launched the campaign to speak to the Arabic language of civics .
And so , so many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why would you be nervous ?
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t have the problem . &quot; &quot; No problem .
This is the blessing of the campaign to protect the language , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you if you &apos;re going to ask me . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t accept that and we don &apos;t accept it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose that translation , because that way .
And if you &apos;re talking about it , I &apos;m listening to Arabic .
We say , &quot; &quot; You know , we want to change our reality , and we want to change our minds and our minds and our agenda .
We &apos;re just like a deer .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you about this song , but you have to answer me from the woman ?
It &apos;s very simple , and it &apos;s very rewarding .
And then we started a whole host of letters written in the sediment .
You see , you see , you see , you see , if you don &apos;t see that , you see , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill the Wizard of Oz ! &quot; &quot; software .
Why ? You know , it &apos;s actually killing language .
We &apos;re not supposed to kill our religion .
If we had to have to have to have , we had to deal with our identity .
We &apos;ve got to tapir ourselves .
We had to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s a serious issue that we have to be able to be able to be granted .
And then we published Arabic letters and girls and girls .
&quot; &quot; Liver &quot; &quot; and boys are pictures of girls and boys .
We are very , &quot; &quot; Are you . &quot;
And who said , &quot; &quot; Ah , &quot; &quot; Aha , you &apos;ve been talking about English . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And you give me a much more beautiful word to me , which is better .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go on the Internet . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a world fan of the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that doesn &apos;t hurt us .
But what we need to believe in the future is that if you don &apos;t have to believe , we should be able to invent things that are bigger , and we need to invent that , and we need to invent that , to make us think about that , to make us feel and feel that they want .
It &apos;s ideological .
If we don &apos;t have to fly in the back , and we can &apos;t see it , and then we can be creative .
Each of you is a creative project .
It &apos;s a path of creativity in your main language .
Let &apos;s begin with the moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel and a quick film .
The novel can be global .
And it can lead to the Arabic language .
It &apos;s not just saying , &quot; &quot; There is no way to go out there . &quot; &quot; There is no way .
But we have to know and believe that we have to have a part of that , and it &apos;s our debt to be part of the way that we get to that .
So , what can you do today ?
Who ?
And if I &apos;ve spent time in time , I would like you very much to say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re in English , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; or in English .
But don &apos;t write in Arabic in Arabic in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is cool . This is not language .
You &apos;re entering the virtuosal language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back to the place .
This is the first thing we can do .
The second thing we can do is we have a lot of other things .
So we &apos;ve been collecting each other to believe each other today .
So we &apos;re here to focus on the importance of the preservation of preservation of language .
Now , I &apos;m going to give you a twist .
The first time it &apos;s ever known for her to have his father .
My daughter was born , I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the assigned , dear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) So we &apos;re going through the Gulin , our essence of ourselves . ( Applause )
And so a few years ago , this is why the American fleet of American Liosstod Morgan &apos;s foot on the surface .
I found a couple of things when I was going to study 30 days .
And instead of going to the end of the months , it became more likely to go to prison .
So for a month , I took a picture of a picture .
So before I go to 30 days before I go to the exam .
And I found myself .
And by the way , this is , by the way , can &apos;t write words .
But you &apos;ll end .
It &apos;s very cool .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m a computer .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m written by my writing . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer .
So I found that they could have a little , free , free and constant opportunity to be an opportunity to be .
Actually , they &apos;re crazy .
( Applause )
The first day that I started to college is full and optimistically filled with our hope .
I had the very high school , my eyes , my eyes , and I started with a journey of love , and I started with the journey of my life .
This is a very challenging image of a very challenging , high energy , and the journey that passed a long , high-energy journey .
And I was afraid , I felt like I felt that I had felt that I had a very strong feeling , and I was afraid of the men , who felt you were wrong , and I was afraid of the real world .
But I &apos;ve been able to hide these silences very well .
The total inspiration was so deeply convincing that I knew that even I knew that there was my first gist , and I &apos;d never known about it .
And as I did , as I did earlier , I was reminded of a very few times when I was walking around , and I was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , the hotel , the hotel , the hotel , the hotel , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to go away .
I had no idea that I had no idea .
And then , on the floor , I put the book on the battery .
&quot; &quot; He opens the door . &quot; &quot; I was wrong .
This was a masterpiece .
And before the day , I was talking about my weeks , and then I was talking about my weeks at all .
&quot; That &apos;s a journey . &quot;
And I &apos;d like to be friends and simplicity for a while , and then I &apos;d like to be friends and hopeful , and I thought , well , this is a very good idea that I would never give you an awful lot of emotions at times .
For a Miguel , I was really proud of the people I was in the world .
I was angry at the time , but I felt like I was trying to find my insecurities and my insecurities .
And I was talking about my father , and he came up , and he arrived .
And it turned out that there was a lot of people who were talking about this : normal people aren &apos;t hearing sounds really serious .
And so I started to get a little bit of fear , which was my Ranger , which was my father , which was my wife , and I gave it to my mother .
I took my husband to visit her arm .
And I had to see if I had a handle , and I was really troubled , and I had to look at my comfort , my self , and I had to go back and forth .
I had a long time and I needed to break it up , and I started talking about my vulnerability .
I mean , that &apos;s the moment when the sound came to me .
I was led to Psychings in Psychings , and I was looking at all the things that I call the &quot; &quot; eureka . &quot; &quot; And so I was able to cooperate .
For example , I used to work as a professor of talking about what I &apos;d like to call the apathy , and when I was working , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to know , I &apos;m going to try , I &apos;m going to try it .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to read , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m reading . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to read it .
After that , it started to get out of the control of the scale .
I was forced into the country , and when I was running , I was putting in anti-schizophrenia , and then the top one : I was the most part of the job , and the rest of it became a sense of vulnerability .
My favorite life is not a great life experience , but I was afraid that I was afraid that I had the fear that I had to believe that I was my product .
This is a climate change in the world , a state of psychosis , and it started to get down to the number of sounds and dreams .
I had a very similar experience , and I had a very similar experience .
For example , if I &apos;m a fan of them , I &apos;m going to make them feel that I &apos;m going to change my life , and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Why do I look at all kinds of things ? &quot; &quot; And they started to get stuck .
The first thing is , the first one I had to do with the myth of sacredness , the more extreme , and the more extreme , the more extreme , and the dramatic tapir .
Do you see the status quo ?
And in the meantime , the streets of the cup of water on the side of the road , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been doing it , and that &apos;s the light that &apos;s lit up on the side of the cup . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the fact that I was , and this is at the moment that my students are on the side of the street .
Eventually , the fear , I became unauthorized , inconsistent , inconsistent , unincomprehensible , and I was not in this case that I felt free .
Two years later , let &apos;s go .
I was very angry at the time of all the girls : crazy sounds , fantastic sounds , weird , unlivable .
And I had a quote from Ruaja , who had been educated , and I had an opportunity for training , and I had a license for psychosis , and I &apos;m a fan of psychosis , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; It gets more comfortable than schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I want to leave you with that schizophrenia .
Now , I &apos;ve always been thinking about it , and I think , at the time , I think it &apos;s going to die of a difference , and I think it &apos;s a difference .
He was sent and knocked down a whole series of Muslims , and he was able to go back and forth , and finally he would have to go back to somebody I &apos;d had to go back to somebody who I had to go back to .
My anger had been shooting to me , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s all about the time , but it was very vulnerable to me and the people who had helped me .
The other side of my life , and my dreams , and my partners , who don &apos;t always fall through the soul of the spirit , and my mom who was ready to wait for it , and I was ready to wait for it , and I was able to wait for that time , my parents who were ready to wait for them , &quot; &quot; Tell your mother-in-law .
I believe , Eleanor will be able to do it .
Sometimes it &apos;s in the snow , and it turns out that it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to thank you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to thank you to thank the beautiful people who are waiting for me to come back and forth . &quot; &quot; So , I don &apos;t want to thank the beautiful people who were waiting for me to go back and forth .
But they were able to get me through the past , and it became the ceremony .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;d like to tell you what I &apos;d like to do , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve always been talking about , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve always been talking about when I was a kid . &quot; &quot; And so , the way I was trying to deal with this was , I realized that these sounds and those sounds that were wrong , and I didn &apos;t have my dreams .
Of course , it was hard to believe in the past , and it was hard to believe that I had to learn how to read it , so I had to learn how to teach myself that I didn &apos;t want to know .
For example , I learned that if I had to teach my home , I was learning how to teach myself about whether I had been educated , and I felt like I felt like this fear and how I felt .
I believed to them .
I was sitting at the door of my parents , and I was sitting at the door of my parents , and I had to draw them out of the way to protect them from my parents .
There was a lot of people in the house , because there was a lot of scientists in the house , who were armed with guns , and they were sitting in the middle of the room .
&quot; &quot; It doesn &apos;t work with me .
Do you see it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have a plastic shot ? &quot; &quot; That was it .
And then I was able to make sure that I was able to know how much I felt when they were hidden in the position of the words that were hidden in the position of the words of the words , and I &apos;d thank them to remember how much I felt , because you know how much I felt , and I think it doesn &apos;t cause me , and I &apos;d convinced them that it doesn &apos;t cause it .
So let &apos;s throw them out , but I started to respond to them , but I started to make a sense of responsibility to learn about how we needed to get to study .
And I found that every one of these things that I couldn &apos;t solve and never solved was I found that I had found that I had no idea of all of this , and I had found that I had no idea that I had ever had .
And the stories went out of these wounds , and it &apos;s been translated into contracts , and I &apos;ve discovered that sounds like this , and I &apos;ve discovered that sounds like this , and that sounds like this , that sounds like this , that sounds like this .
And then , after all , I &apos;d been back at the bottom of the closet , and I &apos;d been back up , and I &apos;d been back out of the closet , and let &apos;s go out of the course of another role in my mind .
Ten years after my time , I was a very high alarm , and I was a very high alarm about the degree of psychosis in the history of psychology , and one year later — I took the highest magnet , and then I took it up .
One of the things I was from the top is my grandmother .
I &apos;m talking about the way that I &apos;m talking about , from the military .
As Osmakken said he said , &quot; &quot; As Osmakken said it .
In the moment , you know , you know , you know , you know about it .
I &apos;ve been working in the press , and I &apos;m going to continue to write a book , and I continue to continue , and I continue to continue , and I continue to keep talking about it , whether it &apos;s wrong , whether it &apos;s wrong .
For all this time , I &apos;ve been able to study them all over the course of all this time , and it increases the sense of conviction and respect and respect .
And I could help other people from the sounds of my mind that I could help other people from their voices .
I mean , I mean , I &apos;m working at the beginning of the Internet , and I &apos;m working at the end of the city of the pyramid , and I &apos;m proud of the end of the pyramid of the pyramid , and the discovery of Dr. Sandcos and Dr. Sandra Essex , who refer to this as a function of the work , is that it seems to be a challenge , and it seems to be a challenge , and it seems to be a challenge , and it seems to be
And the people that have overcome their values and respect to them , and they need to support them , and they need to join them in a full foundation .
This kind of community is possible , and it &apos;s already being built .
We have a similar phrase , which is that we don &apos;t have a turn of social change .
It doesn &apos;t have to play a goat .
It doesn &apos;t take care of it .
For me , it &apos;s not just what you &apos;re talking about , and what you don &apos;t really have to appreciate , is that you have to change the world , and that &apos;s what you have to change the world .
In the last 20 years , the United States of America is dominated by the United States , and there is no spread in 26 countries , and it &apos;s dominated by people who have been expanding the opportunities , and we can expand the opportunity to the human potential , the human potential , the human potential .
And as Pier Levine said , it &apos;s an unconsolidated presence of the ability to use a human being in order to get human health .
It means that the greatest chance of our society — to get somebody who needs to get access to health care — to be able to get access to it , is to be able to break and provide a promise to break and provide .
We &apos;ve got to be able to remember , to remember , to remember .
It &apos;s like that . Okay .
You can &apos;t have the thing that &apos;s happening in our data , and we don &apos;t have to speak up .
It &apos;s invisible .
The eyes are a great adventure , as he said to me , &quot; &quot; Tell me what their heads are .
Tell me about yourself . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
So I &apos;m here to talk about the driver of my solution .
But what is this picture ?
Because , of course , you can &apos;t have a picture with your camera .
And yet , when I was the marathon , the marathon began when I received the first picture .
I had this idea that I had a marathon in the marathon , but in a slightly different way , because it &apos;s a little differently , because I would be planning through the camera .
And when you &apos;ve taken a picture with a laser scanner , it gets ready when you get the button .
So , the picture is not just the right place at the time .
I thought everyone could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , which is the picture of the picture , which is the picture of the picture .
This is what it looks like : this is what it looks like on a platform .
But it &apos;s a invisible game .
And yet , it seems to be close to the truth .
Or the pictures like this — and it &apos;s , you know , dark , but it &apos;s very difficult to maintain and protect and protect and protect capitalism .
When I think of Reagan , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m actually holding up the photo-jam .
Because , of course , these are not pictures that we can do with the camera , but I &apos;d like to have a camera camera .
I &apos;d like to give you a little bit of an idea to deal with the continent .
So that &apos;s really what it &apos;s like to keep the moment of happiness .
What is it that makes it look like this ?
Is it dark if you don &apos;t have these holes ?
Are they related ?
What &apos;s the first date ?
Sometimes it &apos;s perspective from the injury .
But the point is , how do you understand how to deal with the world , and how to do it in 3D .
It &apos;s not really what that reality is , it &apos;s really what they &apos;re looking for .
So the basic idea is that it &apos;s very easy .
And I &apos;d like to have a long time , and I &apos;m going to create an alternative tapir , an alternative that I create .
So let me show you a simple example .
There are the physics that we have in the world of three numbers , in the physical , three-dimensional , 3D .
But in a very specific way , it looks like three-dimensional three-dimensional objects .
And you know , you can &apos;t have it .
So we can play with our brain , because our brain doesn &apos;t know that reality is not necessarily a matter of reality .
And I &apos;m going to see the exact same image of the same process .
This is actually a kind of a different kind of relationship .
So some of the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about , in our agenda , in our everyday lives .
And when you take pictures of the football , it &apos;s really important to know , because it seems to be a bit of a problem .
And what I want to do is , you know , there &apos;s three simple seven months that we have to do .
As you can see , these images don &apos;t have a special part of the picture .
But it turns out , like , something like this .
So in the first century , the pictures are the exact same pictures of the pictures .
The second is that the pictures have to be the light of the dragonflies .
And in both of those two sides , these two biases have been observed in the same volume .
And the third thing is , you know , it &apos;s an image of an image , and it &apos;s the way that you can &apos;t make it out of the way that it started , and that &apos;s what it started with .
It &apos;s a combination of how this picture can be created .
With the difference between the different side of the world , we &apos;re making the boundaries of a variety of different regions of the world , with the color of the field , and the gap between the skin and the color of the field , is that there seems to be a single combination of hundreds of holes , and yet , there are hundreds of millions of noise .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) And people can think that this is an image of an image and the bottom of it , and it &apos;s the bottom line .
But it turns out that this is a picture of the pictures of different areas of different locations .
I think it &apos;s more easy to create a place , which is more easy than it , and you don &apos;t need to change ideas like that .
But it offers a lot of planning .
And this idea was a couple of months , and I could have a couple of months to find that I had a couple of months , and I would have a couple of months to find out where the tapir works .
For example , it &apos;s a picture of the size of fish .
It &apos;s false , and it &apos;s a different reality .
It &apos;s about six percent of the water .
And I was painted , and I painted the house in the middle of the island of the island of Sweden .
So , it turns out that it &apos;s possible to get a close outcome , I think it &apos;s possible .
Every time it works , it starts with ideas .
Then you can make a different picture .
And it &apos;s a piece of good plan .
And if you take pictures , it turns out that it &apos;s very beautiful , and it &apos;s really cool , and it can be quite complicated .
So what we need is all the funds that we need , and the only thing that brings us forward is the story of the story .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Ed , can you come up .
So it was given a data , which has been published in the last few years , and the whole world is broadcasting more and more information than the data published of the world .
Is that possible ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , it &apos;s possible to be true ?
It &apos;s a little bit of insanity that the world is so filtrated by the world &apos;s press , and it &apos;s a small activist that &apos;s going to go back to more information than the world of the world .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people look like this ?
How can I protect myself ?
JA : These are the ones that we don &apos;t know about , and they have different ideas to get to us .
We &apos;re able to get a new way of seeing the information , to make the data available to the Internet , to make the data available to be able to avoid the fact that we don &apos;t have to die .
And the format of information , and what they think about , is that there &apos;s a little bit of a theory that you can see , like , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit like the idea that there might be a little bit of an engineering , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit hard — it &apos;s going to be a little bit hard , and it &apos;s a little bit of it .
CA : So , you know , you &apos;ve got to have your relationships . You know who you can &apos;t know who you are .
JA : Well , we know them are rare . If you don &apos;t know the data , we &apos;re going to get those informs of information .
( Laughter ) The phone rang .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the CIA , TED-shaped , the coding code . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take a look at Mannies .
It &apos;s a few years ago .
Let &apos;s look at it .
It was a story of mine .
Can you tell that story ?
JA : This is the document &apos;s Clinic Report .
After the 200-four years of election election , he was taken by Kenya .
In the last eight years of election election , Daniel Robot was controlled by the statue of the Russian .
He was standing in that Kenyor .
With the power of the Coilessness of Kobi , the Kobi , who came up with the power of corruption , they published that one of the two million pounds in this case .
And the government used to use a political smile like the one who was the richest man in the world .
It &apos;s a great book of the African jug of Kenya .
When I was 28 years older than the election election , I was able to get the papers out of the last 28 years .
And this is the case that we published , and we published this , and we published , and we published , and we published , and we published , and then we published this incident , and that &apos;s what happened to me .
CA : The long word for the long term — not a long time to come up with the government of Kenya , but you know , it changed the result of that election .
JA : Yeah . Well , before the day before the Guardian , then there was the story of the Guardian around the country , Tanzania and Canology in Africa .
The news came from outside .
In a few days of the government , the government started to write about the world .
Twenty days later , he was published in the government of the government , and he changed 10 percent of the foreign security , and he changed 10 statistics from the government , which was the result of the result of the results .
CA : So the information you really have about the information that you leaks around ?
JA : Yeah . Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : This time , you have a video about the weather in Baghdad .
It &apos;s a little length of time . This is a brief clip .
I &apos;m going to say , first of all , there &apos;s a little conductor in this video .
Radio : ... if it &apos;s open , it opens up .
Now , they look at it in the head .
This is the Enlightenment .
It &apos;s fine . It &apos;s fine .
It &apos;s a kick .
Aw , horses .
( Beatboxing ) Dakanm meat , goes on .
Here &apos;s Oldy Cyx Theso-Nx , Bushyx .
I needed to go back .
We killed , and we killed eight every week .
We &apos;ve got two data , we go to the horses .
It worked . It died .
Tho-No-Nx , Tho-Nyx , a fake talk .
Oopins . Who was he ?
Zudly , Kismet . Ahaa , it worked .
CA : So how did that happen ?
JA : It was heavy for the people who have this business .
And in Baghdad , there are two things that are connected in Baghdad .
This is actually one of the three dimensions of the video .
CA : When I was talking to you about the fact that I had 11 , 11 years have been killed by the fact that there was 11 .
JA : Yeah . The two Redpress died , two kids were injured .
And then 1826 , 1826 , the man died .
CA : So this is why the publication of this was published .
What &apos;s the main cause and anxiety of anxiety ?
JA : Well , I think , I think people see the extraordinary importance of strength .
And there &apos;s no reason why you can &apos;t have any one of them , and there &apos;s no reason why I can &apos;t have any one of them — and you can &apos;t have anything — and they &apos;re going to laugh at all of the things that were going on .
And there was two jetnalistic , and there were two jetnalistic , and there was two .
CA : And the American security Organization of America , the LuGraise Manning , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s been about 280,000 U.S. workers who have been resigned by the year .
Is it true ?
JA : We &apos;re in denial of what we did .
Five days ago , after 150 years , there &apos;s a 150 of 30,000 sketches that have existed .
We &apos;ve been able to publish a picture of the book of Reykage in Arabic , but it doesn &apos;t have their relationship .
I had a solution .
CA : If you achieved a diplomatic document ?
JA : Use them . ( Applause ) CA : So , this is what ? ) JA : Yeah . ( CA : Why is it ? ) ( CA : Why is it ? ) ( Applause ) JA : So , how many of the people in the world have been here in the world , and the people in the world are suffering from their faces .
Mystery of mystery is that you have these kinds of materials .
CA : So we &apos;re talking about this about a little bit .
In fact , if you &apos;re on board ?
And what do you have to publish in the right studies ?
JA : Well , there &apos;s a question that is important for the world , which is that you can create a new way of information .
The format is very , very well .
And the institutions that have been able to hide , and they &apos;re able to hide the news , is that the news that those things have come up to be a new and good thing to be able to hide , to be able to hide the data , to hide the data .
It happens to be the case . It &apos;s about the history of Christianity .
CA : But if you don &apos;t have a little security , people who are not sitting there , who are not sitting there , who are not hanging away from you .
JA : Well , it doesn &apos;t like any data that we have .
So we have to protect ourselves from the country .
And there &apos;s some scientists who are listening to that individual , and then we publish , and then publishing .
There &apos;s also , there &apos;s a law , it &apos;s about the size of the disease , it &apos;s protected by the law , it &apos;s protecting it with the fish , but we &apos;re working with friends .
CA : It can &apos;t be good .
If you were to come up with the son of the United States , you have to come up to you and say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , who is willing to communicate with your purpose ?
The American news is that people laugh , when they die .
It doesn &apos;t work with millions of people around the world , and it &apos;s not like human experience .
That &apos;s not my son . What was this thing ? What did you answer ?
JA : Well , it happens very well .
But you don &apos;t need to be able to see that in Baghdad , in Baghdad , in I.D. , where people in Baghdad , they don &apos;t need to see it .
It &apos;s not the change of their minds . It &apos;s not a matter of opinion .
They see every day .
And that &apos;s where people will change the debate of the world , but that &apos;s what we call the Freedom of the people .
CA : So you don &apos;t find a way to see that you can &apos;t see the way that you can see and the way that you can &apos;t see the secret .
It &apos;s beautiful .
But the thing that &apos;s bizarre is that you can &apos;t keep track of themselves , but you don &apos;t have to keep track of themselves .
JA : It &apos;s not exactly what it is . It doesn &apos;t seem like WikiLeabor .
Or we don &apos;t have any data that &apos;s going on in the way .
If you have a lot of them and lots of them , it &apos;s hard for us to continue to make a waste , and they &apos;re trying to help us to continue to waste a waste of things , to make them waste .
CA : And you know what I &apos;m talking about when I &apos;m talking about what I &apos;m talking about — TEDizable , what did they think about this ?
There are two kinds of ideas and Julius and Julian .
One — the truth is that you have to see why they are necessary .
The next thing that &apos;s causing a security .
Who can think of it ?
Why is it that &apos;s causing security ?
JA : Well , there must be a few men .
CA : This is the audience , Julian .
We have a little bit more .
I think it &apos;s not yet published yet , but it will be published .
Is it an interesting thing to deal with recently ?
Is this a document ?
JA : This is an example of what we see every day .
And the end of the last year — November , was in the Albni-Mexico , in the Albni-Mexico , in the Albni-Mexico Gulf , and it &apos;s not as powerful as in the blind .
So we had an engineer , which is actually the size of the partners of the partners who are in the middle of the city , where they were able to have a little bit of the size of the team .
There were others and others here .
And there was no relationship with them , and there was no relationship with them .
We didn &apos;t really know who he was writing .
And we became a little bit skeptical , and there could be a game that would have been the game .
So , let &apos;s look at the classes , and we wrote , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit skeptical .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do .
All right . It seems like that , but we don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And then one week ago , we said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we want to find the information . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , the answer is , &quot; &quot; We want to find the information . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the answer is , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s have a little bit of information .
What are you talking about ?
Do you think it &apos;s a law ?
Are you really ? &quot; &quot; And they sent me the picture of the document , with the Great I.D. , with the picture of the document .
It worked like this .
( Applause ) It &apos;s very good .
This is one of the paths that you have to write , which is one of the ways to write and write and write .
CA : So , how do you have some information ?
JA : Yeah , but it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very hard , but the engineers are the future of engineers .
We &apos;ve spent the last few months in the last few months trying to redirect the stories that we were trying to redeal with for the last few months .
It &apos;s a little bit problematic .
We have an institution like an institution that started in a new process , and we don &apos;t have enough labor , and we don &apos;t have enough labor , and we don &apos;t have enough labor .
CA : To you , the key to saying to you , is that you should be paid to be given the point of the parole , or to the gymnasalists ?
JA : Yeah . That &apos;s the people we have to believe .
And the information that happens is that you need to improve the data that &apos;s being made in a slightly different way . We need to be able to deal with us with a very different way .
CA : Have you ever tried this thing ?
And I was like , you know , I read it , and you &apos;re not going to change 37 schools in your childhood .
Right ?
JA : I was given our filmmakers &apos; film , and one of them was the result of a religious .
( Laughter ) CA : So , I thought , well , they would have been thought of this carpet .
JA : Do you know what ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : So , you know , when you &apos;re going to know your story , you &apos;re going to have a problem , you &apos;d have a problem .
JA : I was a journalist .
I was one of the inventors of activists .
So I got a little bit of a happy age to my friend .
It needs to be a little chance to be a little chance .
It &apos;s possible to do different things with the road .
Sadly , most of the dragonflies have been talking about the number of the Russians .
It &apos;s not like Xaker .
CA : And I can &apos;t think of it as well , and I &apos;m not thinking , well , you know , if you don &apos;t know who you &apos;ve got a doctor &apos;s stamp on . What &apos;s important ?
Can you give you a little data about them , or what you want ?
JA : I think I didn &apos;t have the carrot .
But I think the key to my point is that people don &apos;t create jobs , and people don &apos;t create banks .
And this is what I found out of people who have been studying , like , full of people .
CA : It doesn &apos;t create a fish , it doesn &apos;t create a cooler , the brightness ?
JA : I don &apos;t have a few cases , and I can &apos;t show them all , and I don &apos;t show them the door , and I can &apos;t show them the way that I can &apos;t show them .
This is the defining picture I &apos;ve been for a long time .
CA : Have you ever tried to talk about the last few minutes ?
And so the message that you published there was the software that you &apos;ve published , and there &apos;s a product on the side .
And then , it became clear .
Did you create the name of it . Then what happened ?
JA : That &apos;s big .
It was a place where there was a economy .
It was one of the greatest divide in the world .
My banker was 10 times the year , and was 10 years since my grandfather .
So we published this data last year .
Five to five days before the release of it .
We published the news to be published , and we started publishing , and we started talking about it , and we were talking about it .
And all the way to the extent that everybody was going to deal with the fact that this is not going to deal with , I think , a few years ago , when I met a couple of places , and then I met a couple of places in the world , and then there &apos;s been one of the most sophisticated laws that the people in the world , the Nobel Prize in the world , with the Nobel Prize Nobel Prize winner .
In fact , the United States also has been able to land in the system , and the country was able to get into the system .
And it was considered a month before the law of this law .
CA : Right ?
( Applause ) Axism , Julius , Juliá.
How do you believe ? How do you believe it &apos;s going to be a great picture of the Great Wall ? &quot; &quot; And if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s going to make things happen ?
JA : I &apos;m not exactly the exact same .
All of the world — across the U.S. and the U.S. , and all the way down to the U.S.
You can see what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s very interesting to live , and we can change everything we can change .
CA : You know what we &apos;re looking at , which is , you know , you know what we &apos;re talking about , Julian , you know , you know what we &apos;re saying .
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
I &apos;m trying to tell you a story , and I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about a story today about a story that I &apos;d like to talk to you about , and a little bit about the presence of this .
But before that , let me tell you about my own personal story .
Now , I &apos;m using words as though I &apos;m using words , it &apos;s an engineer , but you &apos;re going to go back to a few months .
In the stratosphere , in France , in the 1970s .
And I had a little bit of this incident , and I had my family , and I came up with my mother .
I grew up as a single child of faith in my life .
In the 1970s , in the 1970s .
My family was a large family , and I grew up in my family , and I grew up in my mother , who grew up in my mother .
I grew up in fact , and I grew up in the world of two women .
It was my mother , the world , the world , of the world .
On the other hand , the religious , religious , fewer or fewer , was my tradition .
And what I was saying was that he was looking at the face of his wife and his wife , and he was looking at a different pattern .
They were sad , people who live in their village , people who live in their village .
Every time I was my tradition , my tradition of my tradition , the number of girls who went to visit , would have gone away from the number of jewels .
Then one of them would go to the block .
One week later , he arrived at the time .
I know that so much , and I know that I had to speak up , and I know that there &apos;s a lot of people who have been talking about it , but I don &apos;t know if I had to come up with a lot of people who have been trying to get me out of my own way .
So I asked my grandmother to figure out what it did ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s a lot of people , but the power of the world . &quot; &quot; He replied , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons . &quot; &quot; And in my hand , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons , if you want to have no idea , if you want to have no idea , you want to get it , you want to get it up .
It &apos;s about the size of the economy .
Each one of us is now , and we are now on social and perfections .
We &apos;re all about it .
We &apos;re born in a certain family , and we &apos;re born in a certain family .
But if you don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know if you can inform the world that we &apos;re talking about in a world where we don &apos;t know anything about a world .
We can get rid of the energy , and the hope is that we have a very long time in the world .
Our friends , our partners , our colleagues , our family , our family , our family , and we have a lot of other kinds of things .
In Turkey , like my tradition , the women are doing something like this one , which is like a bit of a flash of light , or the flash of light on the spot , or the fact that you can see the cup .
And it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of faith in the belief that a person exists , and a lot of people are looking at their appearance .
And it &apos;s one of the great safety of our world , but it &apos;s one of the biggest security struggles in our world .
And there &apos;s a place where there &apos;s all sorts of places , and liberals and women , and they &apos;re religious , and they &apos;re alive , and they &apos;re poor and they &apos;re poor .
And then , in the form of these things , and the kinds of things that are in the form of these kinds of things , and some of those kinds of things .
Now , my writing is , in my mind , is the key to the carrots vaccinate .
Now , when the calculations may not be dispersed , then we can open up the lines in our mind .
And so looking at all of these things , and we can enjoy what we see .
I started writing stories from eight .
My mother gave me the verb to me , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; I mean , it would be a great idea to write about my stories .
Now , I think it &apos;s the time that I think it &apos;s at the time that I think it &apos;s very rare .
My family was good at home , and I was really good at this stories that I had to tell my friends about friends .
I was a kid who &apos;s going to get excited , and I was an intorent feeling that I &apos;d like to close , and I was an intruteer kid , and I was a nerd , and I was a very good idea .
But he didn &apos;t know that my life was already more than the matter of my life , and I wanted to say that I wanted to write about my life .
Instead , I started writing about myself , and I started writing about things that were about them .
So , like this , I started to write this way .
For me , I was very interested in my writing about how many of them were in the courtyard of Stobik .
Give me a little bit : I &apos;m going to tell you how to explain my cartoons .
This one has led to another cooker .
My mom became a certificate .
And I was at the same time when I went to the middle of this small , middle class , and I fell into the middle of the city , and I was the only species in the school .
I had a very long time when I was talking about &quot; &quot; literate &quot; &quot; to me as a typical foreign word , and there were kids all across the desert , but this is what you see when you see what a costume was in the middle of a closet , and the moment of the experience .
In fact , these kids , in fact , have been considered themselves , and they &apos;ve been regarded as much as they did .
We were like , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve looked like that , and it &apos;s fun , it &apos;s fun , it &apos;s a bad mistake , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s outside , and it &apos;s hidden in the way that you hear it .
And as I was like this , as young as I would like to love , she &apos;d always hurt .
And so it &apos;s very good for me , when I was in this school , in Turkey , in Turkey , and it blew up , and it blew up , and it took a 0 to Turkey .
( Laughter ) I spent time on the time of my life , and my thesis was to be married to be married .
I saw the first time in this room for the first time .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; Midly Expresas Exracos . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They asked him to ask me , &quot; &quot; You know , they &apos;ve asked me , &quot; &quot; they asked me to throw my head out of the way .
And I learned about three strings of the triangle , and this is what it was like : the black side and the conquest .
And after the Spaniards , we went back to Ahi and We returned to Angelir .
I think I could have the idea that my imagination and my stories might be able to communicate with myself .
The elders gave me a sense of shame , my litigation and my father — and I was able to figure out how I was going .
I loved the Istanbul that I love 20 years old .
I lived in a very cosmopolitan and living in a living environment , and I wrote one of my novel .
I was there , and I was there .
And I had to know what I &apos;d seen when I was talking about three more than three .
He had a shareholder , he had no drinks in the store , he would not sell a drink in his shop , and he would not speak to the gay guys .
It took a long long time in his head , and he was sitting in front of his eyes .
And I saw him in my head , and I saw him in my head , and I &apos;d like to see him in the middle of the night , and that &apos;s what I saw in my mind , and that &apos;s what I think about in the next week , is that the transgender side of a network of transgression crying on the side of the road .
And when we have a world of death and the cliffs , our experience is just a few hours from the search for a few hours .
And I &apos;ve always convinced that there was a way to read stories .
I don &apos;t want you to know that there &apos;s a very good bet , but I don &apos;t want you to know a good novel , and it gets away from us , and it gets away from us , and sometimes we start to recognize the people we &apos;re not talking about .
And then I went out of the incident of my life , and then I went to college and I went to college .
It was not only about geographic ; it was a complete change in language .
I started writing English .
I think the cursor , my seduction , is the reason why I don &apos;t write English , and the reason why I don &apos;t write the reason why I can &apos;t write and change the way that I can &apos;t write .
I like to write in the words of &quot; &quot; I like you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to write more and more insecure . I like writing in English , I love it , and I think .
I think it &apos;s all sorts of other kinds of connections .
I &apos;ve been able to study English as a million people in the world .
Which is when you teach at the moment , when you learn that later , when you have to lose it .
And as we don &apos;t talk to religion , we want to talk more about better , we want to make better words , we want to make better things , like , because our brain and language are big .
This is a difference .
But if we learn from that fear , it can be style .
This was what I found in Boston — the mountains and a bankrupt style .
I could go back home to my own tradition of my own faith in my life , where I was going to go to my visit to my grandmother &apos;s Day , and then I could go somewhere , and then I could go somewhere , and then I could go somewhere .
My mother liked my own life .
( Laughter ) But instead , I went to try and decide .
And so I began to come up with a journey between Arizona , where I didn &apos;t realize that there was Istanbul , and I couldn &apos;t feel the difference between the two points of the world .
My part of my piece is always , you know , the physical and ruhi perspective .
I think my stories are always cheesy for me and my stories to keep my parts .
And I think it &apos;s my idea that when you connect the story more deeply , it loses its own voice .
I &apos;d like to think about it with you .
One of the things that I wrote in English is one of the things I wrote in English , and one of the things that I wrote in English was this one .
He said , &quot; &quot; I like the book . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; You could write a little differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked what he meant .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you look at your hand , there &apos;s plenty of people , there &apos;s a lot of statistics , American , American , but there &apos;s another species that I think there is , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a person who is a college . &quot; &quot; Well , I think that &apos;s the person who was going to be a college student at the University of Boston , and I &apos;m going to try to figure out what I &apos;d like to say .
But I know that I continue to continue to make it happen .
He wanted my grandmother to be my friend .
He wanted it to be a book , which was a book called a book .
We can see the world of stories , and we can see the stories of the story , and it &apos;s going to be the spread of stories , and it turns out to be what it affects .
Most programmers , particularly who we have not decided to engage with this .
If you &apos;re in the Islamic world , the woman who &apos;s in Islam is waiting for you to write about Islam as well as the Islamic name of Islam , which is better than the woman .
They &apos;re looking forward to the way that you can write the typical typical stories , the typical typical stories .
And in matter of matter , my goodness , my surprise is that the world exists in literature .
The software of the software is not like the creative people who have their ideas , but they seem to look like a bunch of authors and countries of their community .
It &apos;s not the difference of our anger , but they &apos;re waiting for our culture .
In 1986 , the writer and Gailre James Baldeve enabled him to ask her about homosexuality , a few years ago , about homosexuality .
He was trying to figure it out as a blue writer , and he said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t see that in the blue print , and so I don &apos;t have anything else ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you have anything that doesn &apos;t have it ? &quot; &quot; And my mind is the same as the same .
There &apos;s a tremendous cathedral of literature that all of you who have not seen from women in black .
Ten years ago , 10 years ago , I was very good at all .
We were three printers , and one of the manifestations of the FIlippe , one of the Inuit , the Indonyonian , the country .
( Laughter ) But there was no idea of literature , and there was no idea of literature .
We were alone .
They &apos;re waiting for the writing stories about the stories of the Bible .
It &apos;s an informal currency .
It &apos;s not just a lone nut , but they become the result of the larger mass of their larger mass .
And I &apos;m trying to make sure that it doesn &apos;t exist , and it doesn &apos;t exist .
All around the world .
I saw this when I saw that in 2005 , in 2005 , when I saw the words in the century .
And I was working , and I was trying to write , and I &apos;m writing a lot of my friends , and I &apos;m writing a lot of my friends .
My little story turned out to be a huge macro-problem .
So , I was writing about the &quot; &quot; Turk . &quot; &quot; So , some of the people who wrote me were a little bit of magic .
But I &apos;d like to tell you all two things that are just about numbers .
Just a story .
I don &apos;t want to reduce the value of what I &apos;m saying when I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a storyteller .
And so I like to think about how much life doesn &apos;t matter how to cope .
And the software of the software , they &apos;re known to be known , but the political books of the literature , the language of literature .
And so , like , &quot; &quot; Well , the truth of the matter is that the truth and the truth is , &quot; &quot; The truth of the matter and the truth is .
And it &apos;s a piece of art . &quot; &quot; The politics of politics separate us from each other .
One of the things that happens is that it makes sense .
They &apos;re very likely to come up .
One is a border .
He doesn &apos;t know the front lines .
The Black Sea is made out of a great deal .
It &apos;s water .
They had to say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell the stories of the people who have not been talking about their peers , but they &apos;re very likely to tell stories .
They change the way that they vibrate in different forms of different patterns on the stage .
He went to listen to him , and people , who are the Muslims , who are the Muslims , who are not rational .
Ladies and gentlemen , the middle of the Middle East , the Central Africa , the Bond and the Banela Nannies .
And stories today are continuing to transcend borders .
The Palestinian and Israeli Brandi and the Israelites can &apos;t forage for each other , but it seems to resonate with a Palestinian writer who read the head of a Palestinian writer who read the story of a Palestinian person .
You have to take us further away .
If it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s not good .
The books and the kids who are going to be happy and feeling .
But there &apos;s also the security of the book .
And then the software and the assassination of the Rumi , who was the director of the Scandinese spirit , had to go back to the end of the first job of Rumi &apos;s books .
To the Sugons , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know if you can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And the problem today is that we don &apos;t know what the problem is , and the problem today is not limited , but we know more about it , we know that we know that we know that we know , we know that we know that we know , we &apos;re more likely to know , we &apos;re more likely to know .
I love it : living in the motion of the computer .
One of the top of the shopkeeper is fixed .
And the other hand is a perpetual rule , and the third beat .
I &apos;m very interested in my grandfather .
One of the things that I wrote in the writing is called Istanburea , which is another part of the world , and the other part is connected to the world .
And I think my grandfather is also the local , and it &apos;s a university , and it &apos;s still everywhere .
And you know , you &apos;re going to get the meeting with Iowa , you see the meeting , and you see the meeting of 1400 years of Oanger .
And there &apos;s a place called &quot; &quot; Agribe , &quot; &quot; and there &apos;s a place called &quot; &quot; Avish . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a place called a view .
That place is among the buildings of buildings .
I really like this slide .
We don &apos;t believe in the fact that we don &apos;t believe in the world .
We &apos;re making a choice where we think about gender in the presence of the people who are blogging and changing their places in the world .
And I think it should be the objective of artists who are looking at things .
I &apos;ve been working and I have a lot of celebrity .
And I love to think about 10 proof post-ups .
And I like to love my anger .
I can write about the women of my Romania and write about women &apos;s women , and it &apos;s going to be a woman who &apos;s going to be a great miserable man .
We can write about everything we can write about .
Audo Lord says , &quot; &quot; Our clever ancestors says , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean .
And I don &apos;t realize that , why don &apos;t we even learn how to write about writing about the things that you &apos;ve heard about .
Maybe it &apos;s not very good for this .
It &apos;s not based on what we &apos;re doing , what we know , what we know and how everyone is .
We have to teach stories about how we felt about them and each other .
We have to know the stories , we have to recognize other worlds .
And it &apos;s like the nest entrance , like the nest entrance .
And yet , despite the fact that they &apos;re not hanging out of the politics of politics , and that &apos;s good news .
I would end up with the assassination of assassination , saying , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;ll be friends , we &apos;ll be friendly , we &apos;ll be friendly ; it &apos;s the world of gravity . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And my big idea is that there &apos;s a little bit of an idea that &apos;s going to get rid of the secret .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is the woman who belongs to the A , and here are women who belong .
They are women .
So I was quite amazed at the time .
Two years ago , I &apos;ve lost my grandfather .
It was my father &apos;s shirt , and I was running out of the right , five months .
I started understanding the value of the Yuxa .
I &apos;ve been researching my life , and I &apos;ve been talking about my peers , and I can tell you that you &apos;re not going to be more expensive , you know , the only way that you have to be more expensive , you know ?
( Applause ) We &apos;re going to have a world of women &apos;s women .
So we &apos;ll be the most underlying word .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And it &apos;s very rare , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s more likely to be able to get a little bit .
And as recently as a man , he started talking about it , and he started talking about it at night .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not saying — &quot; &quot; You know , you know .
If it was five hours , it would be more interesting ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Most of the guys themselves have fewer porridge .
So this is what I think you want to do with this particular question , if you want to eat it all , and you want to eat it , &quot; &quot; If you want to eat it ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s about eight , but it &apos;s just a few tenths , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; You know , they &apos;re going to be a little tennier , but they &apos;re going to be a few tenths , and they &apos;re still poor .
Increasingly , you have an I.D. .
It &apos;s not to be a good leader , but it &apos;s not going to be a good leader .
Sometimes they &apos;re enough .
I think Lehman Brands , who were not Lehman Brothers , were still married , and they were still married .
( Applause ) When Garders are seven hours old , seven hours , seven hours , seven hours , seven hours , seven hours , or eight hours old .
One of the great things that we &apos;re dealing with is the very good thing for our authenticity , which is the best good for our authenticity , but to the extent to our life that we live in , and what &apos;s good for us .
And I hope that you have to see the power of women &apos;s eyes to see the big ideas in your pocket .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
My husband &apos;s brain disease is a disease .
What &apos;s the problem ?
Dr. Francesca Bennby Bennage .
They said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve been considered normal to be considered normal to be considered .
I found that in my brain , I found that there was a disease .
I was like a kid with a body of women who had no idea .
If you can imagine the brain , the brain is made of two cents .
It &apos;s a part of the honor to honor .
The parallel process is parallel processing .
It &apos;s been consolidated .
And how do you think about things differently , and you think about things differently .
Give me a minute . Thank you very much . Thank you . ( Laughter )
And the right brain is a picture of the motion of our bodies .
Now , the way that you get to the energy of the energy , the way that you see how the Earth looks like , how it feels and how they felt , how they felt and how they felt , how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they felt and how they
It &apos;s an energy in which we can connect with the skin of the right brain .
And we &apos;re at the point , it &apos;s full and the eye .
And our left brain is an entirely different place .
And the left is thinking about the method .
And the left is ready to get out of the way that the landing lands .
And the left is thinking about language .
The mountain world is connected to our world outside of our world .
This is us : &quot; &quot; If you have to go back and get your banjo .
And when he says he &apos;s supposed to throw it out .
And so , I was a job . I started making urine .
From the fact that the word &quot; &quot; eureka , &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s not a matter of truth .
I feel slowly , slowly , slowly .
And when I was trying to get a shower in the dining room , when you &apos;re trying to get a shower in the hotel .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;ve heard about the answer .
I can &apos;t see it with the atoms and molecules inside the inside .
The only thing I could feel was a foreign energy , and it was strong .
&quot; &quot; What did you see me ?
All of my work is all about my work , and all of my work together , and all of my work together , and all of my work together , and all of my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all my work together , and all of my life , and all my work together , and all my work together , and
I think I can &apos;t hear it . ( Applause )
Bring it out to the front of your eye .
It felt the eyes .
And my left brain is back to my left .
And I &apos;m right at that moment .
And then the brain is saying , &quot; &quot; Whoa !
( Laughter ) And then I think , &quot; &quot; Ah , I don &apos;t have time to be able ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have time to be able to get a decision .
I need to call it a village , and I &apos;m trying to call it .
I try to call it .
And I go back and forth , and I go back and forth .
So one of the reasons that I &apos;ve been trying to do is I have the numbers of numbers that I &apos;ve been trying to do with my head .
I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about the Golden Buy Rider .
And so I had some identity and my life and my life .
And my brain , between two and two , between two and two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the two and the
How is it that it &apos;s a great moment , how is it that it &apos;s a great honor ?
And I &apos;ll be able to unite alone , or strong .
And if we choose to direct the direction in our right brain .
