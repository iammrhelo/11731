And I was 11 years old . I was in the middle of the city , and in one of the sudden , you know what I &apos;d like to hear in my home .
It &apos;s very small in the top@@ -@@ white radio test .
And there was a slide that we weren &apos;t used at that time , because the skies were the only one .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban are back . &quot; &quot; It was very clear .
I didn &apos;t realize what that meant , but I could see how my father was happy .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the 17th school . &quot; &quot; He said .
I didn &apos;t know if I could never .
The real high school .
I had six years since the Taliban , and I had six years old for girls .
And then , after five years , I had to have a deer , and I had to get a deer , and I had to get a deer in the secret schools , and I had to get a deer .
That was the only thing that we can &apos;t have to be educated .
So every day we visited the way that you &apos;re going to go to the village .
We would bend our books down to b@@ arefoot bags , just think that we were used .
He was in the school , and he was in a small cot@@ tage that was packaged in a small cot@@ tage .
He was comfortable , but it would be a lot of cool .
We could have students and women , and our parents , our parents , we knew our life .
Sometimes , for the Taliban , the Taliban were connected by a high school .
We were always protecting what we knew about what we knew .
Can you see it ?
Do they know that we live ?
And it was a place where we wanted to be high school .
I was very lucky , and I grew up in a family , and I grew up in a family .
My father was a human being in her own way .
He had a very different view of his grandfather who lived in a living room , and his father , the father of my mother , he insisted that my mother had diarrhea , and it &apos;s been viewed by the father .
But my mother had been educated .
Whoa .
Two years ago , and the girls on the side of our house and girls were helping a school for women and women .
And it was â€” it was the first one that had to do with his family .
And they had no surprise that their kids had to get educated , and they didn &apos;t have to go to the Taliban , and let &apos;s look at the Taliban .
For her kids to get educated , they were safer .
I would have been in the Taliban , and it would have time for time , and I would have been looking at a ray of light from my life , and I would have been running through a ray of light .
He &apos;d come to me , and he was saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m girl , I &apos;m girl , you lose anything in your life .
You can have a little bit of a condom . You can put it in war .
But the only thing that &apos;s going to happen is that if you &apos;ve got to get a handle on the side , and if you &apos;ve got to sell it to school , we &apos;re going to sell it to school .
Now , do I still have to continue ?
I grew up in a country where I grew up for decades .
But if you &apos;ve ever done that , but six percent of my conservatives have finished , and if you were in the course of my educational progression , it was so popular .
So , in the meantime , I &apos;m here , I &apos;m going to be here , a M@@ id@@ and@@ le@@ d@@ bury .
( Applause ) When I went back to Afghanistan , one of the very first images of me , my father , who was sending me back to school .
It &apos;s not because it &apos;s not because I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m not because I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m afraid of the first woman to walk around .
( Applause ) I think it &apos;s amazing .
I have the insects , and my family is more and more of my family .
And so , in this case , I am an ambassador of a 24@@ 7 campaign that &apos;s been teaching women about women .
This is a country where women are still risky when women are still risky , in a country where women are still risky when women are risky .
And it &apos;s the very core , which is that I see that in my high school , I see that there &apos;s a very good thing .
And I see how their fathers , as my father , did , as my father did , see how their dad had come to me , and I see how they were amazed to their girls .
It &apos;s like E@@ yn@@ est , and I don &apos;t know what the truth is , but it &apos;s the ancestor of one of the people in my own .
Just a month ago , a week ago , when he was visiting his village , she was watching them a few .
And so he played phones too , and the night on the phone , I went on to go to school , and on the phone , I went back to school .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve been willing , you &apos;re killing me . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; But I don &apos;t know what your village is , and I &apos;m going to tell you what your village is going to protect the future of tomorrow . &quot; &quot; And over the course of the last century , it &apos;s been viewed by women , sometimes by women who are watching the success of the girls of the girl .
It doesn &apos;t mean that our descendants of our kids aren &apos;t hungry .
In fact , their ancestors are the mothers who believe their daughters will be in the middle of the world , but in a society , the people who believe girls are the ones that are in the world .
And the number of girls on the Taliban , and the number of girls on the Taliban , and you know , it &apos;s been growing up .
And yet , there &apos;s a lot of girls who go to school and girls who are in Afghanistan .
( Applause ) It looks very different , and it looks very different .
I think they see what they see in their change .
I &apos;m scared of these change , and I &apos;m afraid that these change will not be very long .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , when I went back to Afghanistan , I would raise my hand and see if I saw children who have their kids , who have a very illu@@ minating future .
It &apos;s the country , and the boundaries of Afghanistan are the country , and the girls are the country , and the girls who read it every day .
And they make great stories like me .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And so that &apos;s a trip to the audience , and everyone knows that it &apos;s like cute , and you can go down for two half hours .
And you see here , you see your bioluminescence , but it &apos;s a world for light .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So , the color of the color , the color of the Sun , the color of the Sun .
And they &apos;re cute che@@ esy .
My favorite design is this joke .
This is exactly what the sculpture works .
This is the world . And this is the world that &apos;s unknown in our oceans .
It &apos;s underwater , underwater .
It &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a place , and it brings up to the floor .
The females see the only one that &apos;s ever more proud to see .
Take a look at it . Watch the R@@ wand@@ an , the network on the right , on the left .
I was a fan back , and it &apos;s a step back .
I love it . I love Se@@ p@@ ines . This is an engineer of magnitude .
Watch the touches of it . It gives them a little bit of it .
It &apos;s in the rubble .
This is the game that moves , and we learn a lot of new things in the summer .
And it &apos;s a stroke . Isn &apos;t it incredible ?
And the fact that modern day comes up and says , &quot; &quot; E@@ h , it &apos;s viewed .
It &apos;s very good when it &apos;s possible .
And he does a fake . Let &apos;s go back .
One . Three . Three .
On the bottom , who &apos;s the geography of the Christ , but the foreign world .
Everything changed from the dark .
When you see the first example of the story .
and I never forget .
And now , I didn &apos;t know if I can &apos;t .
And so you can see that the images of the Gulf of China .
The front is a part of religion , which is a part of religion that has a part of religion that the front lines of religion is a part of religion .
As a fairy Korean girl , I like a hat .
I could come back with the way .
And I and I ask the question to the question .
If anything was clear about anything .
I had to answer questions .
A police officer was one of those units .
But by the way , with the European police police , but by the country .
I was very lucky to bet , and I was very lucky to bet that there &apos;s lots and lots and lots of lots and lots and lots of different institutions .
And then a new language taught a new language , and then , after the job , the entire life of all life .
You don &apos;t have to dive in part of South Korea .
We were all Korean , but 6@@ .7 years , divided apart from the divide .
If you don &apos;t have a South Korean state ?
So I started thinking about how to give them a x@@ o@@ um .
And I went back to the front of the pharm@@ acy .
I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; When I &apos;m in China .
I &apos;m standing up to thinking about it and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to think about it , and I &apos;m just standing up to thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m standing up . &quot; &quot; And I was standing up to thinking , and
I was il@@ legally un@@ fur@@ med .
And then shortly thereafter Lau@@ ri@@ e shares .
And we &apos;ve arrived very close , but I was very close to the middle of South Korea .
Nobody ever saw someone .
I &apos;ve been able to explain to the point where I had to get to the point where we had to get to .
My life is the icon of my life .
They wash a little bit of money and they get paid less money .
And I &apos;m sure , TED is not explicitly .
This is what we design in 2009 in 2005 .
We &apos;re in the form of data formats .
It &apos;s going to hit the way that it &apos;s not based on it .
You can see , you know , kids are very keen to get kids .
This looks like this .
Why is that ?
She said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the milk of the milk to happen . &quot; &quot; He said .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you take a village out of the village ?
I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Su@@ ver employee must be . &quot;
We &apos;ve done an ap@@ tor , but around the trees .
There are three older women in the room .
They invented these sediment that we call them .
But all of you are using other purpose .
They &apos;re separated over the sediment .
Kids are slowly falling .
( Laughter ) Sometimes it &apos;s going to pile up to 40 to close children around a tree .
This man is so much like the tree of the boy who likes it .
( Laughter ) Every single time , when you have an exploration , they sit in the village .
It looks very cute from the bottom .
They just read the kinds of things that Lau@@ ri@@ e had .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve made it possible to make it possible , because we want to see kids in the room , and we want to see it on the top .
And the drama is very high , but it happens to see the ceiling .
This is a place to get on the foot â€” there &apos;s all the light .
You see , you see , you know , you &apos;re looking at a friendly pipe in the classroom , and it &apos;s the way that you see it .
But they don &apos;t have to draw , but they &apos;re filling it with water , filling them with water .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s completely autonomous time during the year .
It doesn &apos;t have a journey from the desert and the desert .
And it turns out that you &apos;re in the beginning of the experiment .
There are no memories .
There are no che@@ fs .
Their kids are starting to operate at the time of the kids .
But it doesn &apos;t have any reason to do it .
It doesn &apos;t exist here .
It says that if you don &apos;t want to be in the Bible , then you can see that there &apos;s a picture that doesn &apos;t want to be in the Bible .
It will be Baghdad , and it will go back to the economy .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m saying , like , kids like this are staying in a long way .
And they go back and forth .
This is the process .
And secondly , we are very important to have a sound that sounds silly .
You know , kids have a better choice .
And they don &apos;t sleep .
And the classroom is higher in the classroom , and the classroom is higher .
You know , our allies are actually growing up .
You need them .
You can &apos;t tell , you can &apos;t talk about your friends with your friends .
You don &apos;t have to have you .
You know , when we &apos;re trying to make things happen .
Now , here &apos;s okay .
And then we can see that in the winter , at 20 degrees Fahrenheit , 20 degrees centigrade .
And then we shake it .
It &apos;s about 50 degrees in sand .
We don &apos;t have a water .
We &apos;re not in the Age .
So , we &apos;ve been able to get on the fish .
We have to act with kids .
And they &apos;re trying to break the fly .
It &apos;s actually not allowed to help them .
They don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) This boy is in the middle of this kid .
And that &apos;s what neural parks is .
This is one of the diamonds .
They &apos;re pretty nervous here .
There &apos;s a lot of older women .
It &apos;s trying to keep the part in the light from the bottom .
( Laughter ) More like . ( Laughter )
And there &apos;s a meeting in the classroom in every classroom .
It &apos;s in Santa &apos;s , in Santa &apos;s .
And this is the one that was built , and it has been built with flat sheets .
And there &apos;s five of them , and there &apos;s seven coral reefs .
So Ivan is very .
We have an idea of security .
Let &apos;s explore a Japanese son .
They try to get inside .
It matters .
You know , it &apos;s a miracle .
It &apos;s controlled . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) This is what it is like to be from the tree .
Then we had the other kids .
You know , the T@@ hai room becomes a lot .
( Laughter ) She tries to learn how to get the driver in the world .
You have to teach kids in less than kids .
And it turns out that they can &apos;t help each other in the world .
It &apos;s a society , and we give these kinds of opportunities .
This is what a boy moves from minus 300 to 300 , 300 to 20 years .
It &apos;s 18@@ 3 million .
It &apos;s not really small .
Well , this little little bit of a young night .
But it &apos;s still right now .
And the kids are moving to the middle of a child .
It &apos;s very high-resolution that the kids in the room are very high .
He &apos;s always saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t give them a hug . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t give them a hug .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they open up for their essence . ( Laughter )
And I think it &apos;s not the way that I think it &apos;s , and it &apos;s not yet to protect them from the high school , but they &apos;re not the military .
They have to get a Achilles pointer .
Because it will teach them how to live in life .
I think it &apos;s an opportunity to change the world &apos;s lives and people .
This is one of those building blocks to change the lives of children .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;ve been working with a gi@@ g in two years at the H@@ un@@ era .
And I got the first classes , and I got the first classes of the first classes , and I got the first time to get in the first classes .
But my brother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; They wanted me to be engineers like them .
And then I was a translator , which was a very good income , which is the best way to come up with a good economy .
I don &apos;t like it to love my work .
But my wish was to be a Chinese opera .
So this is the way that I &apos;m playing a clip .
To be an interview with the opera , it needs to be as much as a suc@@ ker , and I took the future to get to the opera school .
And I wrote a letter to the school , and I wrote it back at home .
But they didn &apos;t like my idea .
Nobody believed that I was serious .
But my friends would have been to me , and they would have been as proud of me .
So I realized that I was going to be a 15 years old .
It wasn &apos;t a reality .
I was afraid when I would get a second party like the end of my life .
But it was un@@ consci@@ onable .
We decided to find another way .
No one will ever have anybody ? No .
I interviewed books .
To give you the gift of V@@ ag@@ arin , I was amazed by the British family .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The other name is called E@@ ch@@ o C@@ han . &#93; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I was saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s been viewed from the history of history .
And it turns out that the Q@@ ur@@ an books are celebrated in China .
&quot; &quot; The Digital Universe &quot; &quot; is right .
There is no use for Pro@@ sk@@ ate . I get to see .
The Bible is interesting , a little bit odd .
( Laughter ) This is the rest of another day .
But my fifth e@@ mi@@ si@@ veness gave me the enlighten@@ ment . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to have an honor and recognition . &quot; &quot; It says .
I turned to the &quot; &quot; Achilles &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Hun@@ ter . &quot; &quot; And so in this way , I was able to reconnect with my parents in Congress , and I was able to reconnect with my parents in Congress .
So let me tell you that I would have a new part of my new public education .
It can teach you so much .
For example , this map seemed to me the first one , because in China , we grew up studying this experiment .
Never thought that China is in the center of the world .
Actually , the map shows the world .
It &apos;s not new .
This is a standard practical world in my hand .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of my hands , and there &apos;s my hand , and there &apos;s my hands .
It helps me and it helps to be aware of it .
So I thought , well , why are you in a daily life ?
So , I started to read books of books .
Suppose you had the same , the people who have been amazed at the same incident : &quot; &quot; Benjamin Jefferson . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; John Ad@@ ams , &quot; &quot; written &quot; &quot; John Ad@@ ull@@ lo@@ oth &quot; &quot; and the end of the exact same thing as a part of the world .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The Hi@@ m of &quot; &quot; folder : &quot; &quot; The F@@ lan@@ g &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Man : Warren . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Man : Warren . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I have a story about a few moments of mine . ( Laughter )
For Jesus , it was economic and political and political .
And it &apos;s interesting to look at all the things that are in Buddhi@@ sm : odds , fear and awe .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , reading the book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ ang T@@ i . &quot; &quot; Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Th@@ row water . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; T@@ o : Water lie . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I made another mistake .
And I realized , for example , I realized that the translation of the translation of the Q@@ ur@@ as is in meaning , which is &quot; &quot; Ol@@ ny . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; new mother@@ -in-law . &quot; &quot; Yeah !
( Laughter ) The book goes past , and I &apos;ve been able to connect with all the people in the world .
I know that I wouldn &apos;t be any lonely alone .
What you &apos;re trying to do is make sense of the other human beings that are not going to happen .
And I started to believe that it &apos;s not the only purpose of the desire to happen .
The purpose of the generation is that we don &apos;t need to connect with the point of the desire to come and not connect with the point where we don &apos;t connect .
And the desire to do that is to do it .
This is the book , and I &apos;m here today , and I &apos;m here , and I &apos;m very interested in a very good purpose .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve always been the book .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in your office , and you have to look at your room , you get your room to your room .
It &apos;s just taking place .
It doesn &apos;t just give it the way to it .
So today to work today .
It &apos;s not like anything .
Have you ever followed and said , &quot; &quot; Why am I my shirt ? &quot; &quot; Well , right now , China &apos;s morning , and you &apos;re in your office and you &apos;re in your office and you &apos;re in your office .
( Laughter ) And this is one of the women who have been known to you .
And when this journey is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to go back to that two hours . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So every day , I &apos;d like to go back and forth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , we have to invent a lot of our business devices .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very odd thing for me .
From time , you know .
In fact , I believe that Ra@@ verse is a new idea of Ra@@ verse .
( Laughter ) And the fundamental idea is to think about the fundamental principle of the nervous club . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a dinosaur â€” and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Ah , I &apos;m sure you should go , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you shouldn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , it &apos;s important .
It &apos;s all about the success of the success .
And one of the things that goes well is really good for us .
But in the last few years , there &apos;s a long time in the last few years and wide forms of globalization .
( Laughter ) We have to dance . ( Laughter ) This is not the very good thing to have this man , D@@ R@@ S , no idea that this man can &apos;t have a good option , D@@ R@@ S , which we create .
I &apos;m actually , in fact , there &apos;s D@@ R@@ S-@@ Shar@@ d .
I talk to you .
So a few years ago , I put a little video on a top@@ -@@ night video .
It &apos;s about five minutes of about five minutes of the video that we &apos;ve ever known about .
The criminal justice of the informal , who doesn &apos;t have to control it here , here &apos;s the criminal justice industry .
They don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve been for granted .
And it was in a workshop .
We have to laugh .
( Laughter ) So let &apos;s look at it in the spring .
( Video ) The point is that our goal is to agree with a very important moment .
As a group of people , who were involved ?
Hello , Johan@@ nes . I &apos;m working today .
( Laughter ) Thank you . Thank you for you .
And I was thinking , well , there &apos;s a lot of people we want to take on the island of the ship .
And as a group â€” ( Laughter ) S@@ ong â€” ( Laughter ) â€” &quot; &quot; Who ?
Have you ever arrived . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s like that ?
Well , it seems to me .
And after a few decades , over 500,000 countries , over 500,000 countries , over 500,000 people , was really looking at this video .
And then three years later , this video takes a look at it every year .
If these numbers of these numbers and millions of us have been from them .
And I &apos;ve been amazed by the images of the Internet .
To find that it &apos;s useful to find that it &apos;s useful to find that it &apos;s useful .
And I started to start with a 3@@ 0-@@ year-old night .
There &apos;s only 78 percent of all the players who are lucky to laugh .
( Laughter )
Right ?
And you can &apos;t see that in fact the blind people look at the human journey .
One of the simplest flute players .
Which is , you know , India doesn &apos;t have a complete relationship with the city of India .
A@@ pp@@ o U@@ p@@ sal@@ a , the last light of the Sun .
I think the biop@@ os@@ e@@ onal of the person who was smiling in understanding the insec@@ uri@@ ties of people smile .
Now , the artists of the smile did have been made of , and they &apos;ve got to be a dark game in their mouths .
In the book , &quot; &quot; N@@ ams , &quot; &quot; in his book , &quot; &quot; The icon of a unified theory .
And then before the wall of the boat , and then the head of the lake .
This is the theory of the scientific business , and it creates a way that helps people feel better than how they feel .
The style can be added .
( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a person who was smiling , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit more .
You &apos;ve been able to get your skin at a high level of fluids that you &apos;ve never been able to wear , where you don &apos;t have enough calories to eat .
I &apos;m Mon@@ k@@ l S@@ op@@ h@@ ond , &quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ b@@ Ã­@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ru@@ pp@@ o , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gay .
When we plot the money , I think it &apos;s about the money , my p@@ love , my marathon , their marathon , and they &apos;re like my hand , my anger , my anger , my bro@@ the@@ he@@ m , my steak , and this is kind of meaningless .
And if you &apos;re in the last time , you have a lot of things , like , you know , when you &apos;re alive .
And some of you may have known as a car@@ rots .
But you know , there &apos;s a lot of the magic .
We &apos;re surrounded by the police of the police administration , and we see them , and we &apos;re watching them . ( Laughter ) We want to change the idea of P@@ is .
Let me show you one example of the experiment .
It &apos;s possible . It gives us the N@@ BC for the N@@ BC .
The woman &apos;s &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s crazy .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 .
( Laughter ) And they &apos;ve been able to have to have to have to have to give up to 900 dollars .
It &apos;s a plastic thing that Ra@@ di@@ o Sha@@ ck anten@@ nas .
You can use a lot to look at things like this , but it &apos;s about three times the time in your students .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Video ) : When you go to this place , when you go to this room , you open your head , you open your head , you open your head .
Something like this .
In@@ <unk> .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m â€” that &apos;s a little bit inclined to go right .
So we &apos;re going to look at the dark test .
Well , it &apos;s tiny , it &apos;s going to go on the side .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) If you have a soul , you have your hands . ( Laughter )
Of course , this is the question , which is the great question : How do you get a mar@@ ch@@ at ?
And this is what Ca@@ va@@ b is : if you open your head , you can open your head .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) And we don &apos;t hear that , but we don &apos;t find our tapir .
And the key to my close nitrogen in here is , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s like the Ecu@@ ad@@ ers , the astro@@ masters and the patience and the patience .
People would remember what they found .
And then we have to go through everything , and we do not think about the number of things and purpose .
So here &apos;s this .
We took two , we took a picture of the T@@ unes T@@ ill@@ ings , who have been recorded , and then we have a blank slate .
And 50 percent had been successful . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And so , the result is that we get this result .
This is an interesting example of what we &apos;ve done with things .
&quot; &quot; S@@ burst &quot; &quot; is published in three months , and every one of the things happens .
This is the future of the future .
How did people go ?
So I have this picture of my work , and this is the picture , and this is where people are .
In every decade , my average number is increasing .
Very interesting .
Don &apos;t think of it as a very exciting thing .
El@@ am and religion ?
It &apos;s a privilege to engage with your hand .
These are two different things .
It &apos;s not my hand , it &apos;s working .
I think it &apos;s a very strange picture .
For all the other phenomena , it &apos;s the way you &apos;re looking for models .
What &apos;s more to you ? How much do you think of the world in the world , and there &apos;s a long way to go away from the galaxies of the galaxy , &quot; &quot; De@@ li@@ tics .com , &quot; &quot; for the ad of the fer@@ mentation of the fer@@ tile ?
And I was like , &quot; &quot; S@@ cat , &quot; &quot; read it from one of the &quot; &quot; Sh@@ h@@ ula , &quot; &quot; by the way .
( Laughter ) And the main question is that it &apos;s more inclusive than what it means .
So before we say , we have to be able to see that the world belongs to another world .
Is it more inclusive ? Is it more likely to help me to have an impact ? &quot; &quot; And he was saying , &quot; &quot; The <unk> We@@ ally News New@@ come , &quot; &quot; it made it up ?
( Laughter ) And this is what I like to do with Sydney &apos;s cartoons .
And I think I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Then you know , I &apos;m going to show you a great deal .
I think you should tell you the second batteries . &quot; &quot; This is the slide of all intelligent design .
That &apos;s the product of cartoons .
( Applause ) You can have V@@ E@@ R@@ T@@ A@@ A@@ N@@ B@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ A@@ N@@ R , you can have an idea .
It doesn &apos;t happen anything to read .
This is the result of artists , for the sake of moral design .
And they &apos;re saying , well , they call them , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Sometimes , they call it dark dark energy , like dark matter .
This is an example of a change in my hand .
And this is the end of the experiment , and this is the last hal@@ er .
It &apos;s the same question . Which is more reality ?
What is the U@@ FO@@ s glow , where if you shouldn &apos;t ?
This is my home in Al@@ ta@@ try California where my home would be lit from the Al@@ ta@@ try California .
It &apos;s kind of like a Buddhist contemporary network , and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s just the magic .
&quot; &quot; Phot@@ ographer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phot@@ ographer &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t have high-speed technology .
This is a &quot; &quot; K@@ od@@ ak In@@ s@@ ane &quot; &quot; by K@@ od@@ ak In@@ fin@@ ded .
Somebody had stopped in Arabic .
The camera was ready â€” it &apos;s like that .
( Laughter ) You can think of that , and you can think about it , and that &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s going to be a great deal .
And if you take it further , we &apos;re looking for a quantitative perspective between the obser@@ vable responses and the theory .
So , for instance , there were two problems with the computer of G@@ ag@@ arin in Saturn .
The first is , there was no theory about the plate .
And secondly , he was tuned and blurry and blurry , so he didn &apos;t realize that he could have seen it right now .
And he wrote this kind of thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been looking away at the bottom of the planet with three objects . &quot;
He decided that he was this .
So , you can &apos;t see that there &apos;s a very good plate without a good plate .
This is what happened 16@@ 57 .
This is a journey of &quot; &quot; Christian , &quot; &quot; and this is a picture of the book that was collecting Saturn .
This is the two things you know , and there was a very good theory of the solar system , and there was a very good theory about the solar system , and that &apos;s because we understood that the Kepler was getting faster than Saturn .
And we could have this telescope on the surface .
This is the theory of the theory .
The reason why the theory of theoretical reasoning can be full of scientific stories .
One of the reasons why one of the reasons why we have to believe is that we don &apos;t have a very good reason to believe , and then I &apos;m sorry .
Every time we see it , we have dental tooth .
This is the sad one .
In 1979 , in 1976 , NASA would have been interested in the images of the same place , and people thought that this is the picture that was created by the let@@ tuc@@ es .
This is a picture of a beautiful picture in 2000 .
If you shake your eye , you can tear it up .
You are converting your eyes to a more exotic image , and you can &apos;t see the pleasures of the data .
And the question that you should be looking at is , you know , you &apos;d have seen sad , because we &apos;ve evolved .
It &apos;s very important to us .
And of course , they &apos;re laughing . It &apos;s the easy to see .
You see the contrast in the light .
( Laughter ) And if the astronomers had the inter@@ connection to the G@@ our@@ ties , they saw it .
You see the fish . Did you see what they had ?
Or were the elephant elephant .
The icons .
( Laughter ) In 1990 , in 1990 , A@@ y@@ l@@ oth .
It &apos;s about five dollars , and it &apos;s about five dollars to see the arrog@@ ance of the priest , until Ra@@ di Ter@@ ri@@ al Ter@@ ri@@ al .
So here &apos;s the Ba@@ ob@@ pe Gu@@ in@@ le and Wat@@ er@@ ly , down on the bottom .
And the dog is the kind of thing that &apos;s pron@@ oun@@ ce@@ able , because there &apos;s gray , bul@@ ly , black , crying , and you see these pictures , people see the pictures , and they see the picture .
This is a Ba@@ z@@ in &apos;s village in Sa@@ o Paulo .
So here I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m going to do in my head . &quot; &quot; And I was able to see that in the rubble of Lau@@ ri@@ in Village , I was able to see it .
( Laughter ) You can pay 28 dollars in this year .
How do you read now ? Am I miserable ? ( Laughter )
Their religion , in the case of 194@@ 4 , is the pollen number one .
I &apos;m going to get my B@@ le@@ w@@ on in Chicago .
And to see this , I &apos;ve looked at this .
There were plenty of people .
With the car cars , it &apos;s a very lesbian person with their pocket .
So we &apos;re more interested in it .
You know , you know , this is D@@ w@@ kins , and I was on the stage , and we &apos;ve been on top of two , two , two , two and two .
And people are in the sense of respect for respect .
And we looked at the time to see what &apos;s going on .
This is a picture of a picture , which is a picture of the funds and the park tree .
And this is the picture that I &apos;m looking at in the other hand .
And every person could have a wonderful picture .
( Laughter ) This is what I &apos;m really saying now , if you don &apos;t ? ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to finish with another my@@ stic nitrogen attached to it .
There &apos;s a film called &quot; &quot; The Beautiful Night , &quot; &quot; which is the May@@ al Kit@@ tens , the dead of the dead .
And when you arrived , it &apos;s a very large time in the dead , and it &apos;s very much .
It turns out that you can &apos;t see it .
The answer is the result of the dead .
( Laughter ) In this movie , it &apos;s been hidden in the course of electronics .
I had uploaded it from a number of E@@ .D. .
This is the most popular .
This is a very silly thing to be famous .
( Bar@@ n &apos;t words ) If there &apos;s a lot of things , it &apos;s going to be nervous .
Ma@@ y is our summer summer .
It &apos;s going to have time to change the way you can change the way .
You can listen to the whole day .
Now , let &apos;s go back to the translation of it . Can you imagine the hidden message ?
( Music )
( Music and Arabic ) What would you do ?
One of the biggest things ? You can &apos;t see anything .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you what your brain is , and we &apos;re going to have to listen , and we &apos;ll be listening .
( Music ) It &apos;s possible that we can see what it is . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to end with a little , fresh and beautiful story .
&quot; &quot; The P@@ ris@@ ons &quot; &quot; is an international organization .
We &apos;re looking for looking at things in humans .
And there &apos;s a pop world .
It &apos;s very popular : It &apos;s called K@@ ac@@ <unk> Me@@ trics .
There &apos;s very much temperature .
It was among the best five years in 2005 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Multi@@ ple million laptops . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a story that Brit@@ th is N@@ ah , and his son is a very good position to see , and he &apos;s still in the face of his head .
I have a feeling like this .
( Music ) We are 12 billion light-@@ years away . This is , you know , it &apos;s wrong . Nobody thinks it &apos;s true . But I can tell you that it &apos;s true .
Announcer : Yeah . I &apos;m at least about close .
This would be the &quot; &quot; light of &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Anyway , I &apos;m amazed by my friends . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Anyway , I &apos;m amazed by my friends , and it &apos;s the teacher &apos;s teacher &apos;s book , and it &apos;s the teacher &apos;s teacher .
And therefore , &quot; &quot; The Gu@@ ar@@ son@@ al &quot; &quot; is written about the destruction of the Kal@@ an , where you know how far away we are in the border .
We &apos;re not going to have 12 billion light-@@ years away from 12 , 13@@ 7 billion light-@@ years away .
And then we know how much it is until the small story should be .
So , if not entirely smooth , we can say that it &apos;s very close .
And so I was saying , after the 14th , and after the night , I was very shy , and I was very shy , and I was very shy , astronomy .
I had to maintain it . He wrote his own Mahmoud .
And I have to end with that .
( Music ) We have 13@@ 7 billion light-@@ years away from the beginning of the universe .
It can be shared differently , but it &apos;s very simplistic .
And so I &apos;m going to think about the information in our environment , and this is what I &apos;m going to call it .
( Laughter ) Right ?
( Applause )
If you have the writing in the world , you have to have an expression in the Middle Germany .
He had to have an example of a press written on the machine .
The government could have heard of all the texts of all the texts .
And when you think about a piece of paper , it could have been able to think about a piece of paper .
And we &apos;ve been able to do this as a very large event , and we &apos;ve been in a very large fashion .
We couldn &apos;t invent it in the world .
But this morning , in 20@@ 1@@ 13@@ th , there &apos;s a laser pointer of any famous brand , a laser pine device , and then you click on the stage , and you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a little bit of the printer and the printer , and the printer will be able to see from others .
This is the reality today .
Nobody wants this .
This is an example of the technology that our anger â€” is an example of an example of the human foundation .
The problem is that three key ideas are the one of the problems .
And when we look at the early problems , the early adop@@ ters in the early 20th century .
This is a three-@@ key thing that these individual worms are .
First , it &apos;s exciting to breed .
This picture in this picture is like the D@@ M@@ ri Ga@@ ve .
And it &apos;s not really hard to understand the reason why you don &apos;t need to be a rebel .
These men get money .
They &apos;re very , very , very much , very much , very much , to get paid .
In fact , we saw people who are genetically engineered to be a million@@ aire .
This is the Lu@@ di@@ mir Th@@ es@@ h@@ ou .
This is the Al@@ f@@ ond G@@ on@@ z@@ les@@ .
This is Stephen Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ orn &apos;s .
This is Matthe@@ w Anderson and Japan , and you can extend the politics .
These guys are heading online , but they &apos;re not in a natural law , we can use it as a banker to make money to make money to make money to make their money , or a computer , or a computer program , and the credit card credit card information , and it &apos;s going to take care of us .
And two months ago , two months ago , in this picture of the Muslim government , the mother of the Muslim world , and in the case of the British , there was about 14@@ ,@@ 9 million U.S. dollars in this picture .
It doesn &apos;t know that Sam Jean is in the tastes .
And I think that day , we have to be able to be able to be a family manager in the world .
And it turns out that there seems to be even worse .
And it &apos;s going to be a great girl , and it will lead .
The second is why the second big one that makes an experiment that has evapor@@ ated .
And the reason why the reason to see them is that there might be a consequence of the reasons why the idea is , the idea is that there might be declining .
As a result of women , women who grew up in the last year grows and start keeping the point in the early adop@@ ters .
If I had two of those who are three-@@ key , they &apos;re ax@@ i@@ y-@@ xi@@ ri@@ er , and they &apos;re ex@@ uber@@ ants like that , like the one that makes these jobs for money , and the third essential , and the press and the press .
Let &apos;s zoom in on to the head of the world .
This is an example of the obvious example of what is what happens when governments are watching their civic principles .
It &apos;s a slide of an ceram@@ ics in which it was â€” it was more specifically â€” it was like â€” it was like â€” it was like .
In the last year , the year after the last year , we were talking about it .
Somebody went into the system , and they &apos;d collapsed in the system .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve asked the Dutch &quot; &quot; to the Holo@@ caust of the Holo@@ caust , and I asked him , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you believe it ?
He said he believed .
How is it that people die like this ?
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; D@@ ep@@ ot@@ ire . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
It &apos;s an E@@ ene@@ tic ceram@@ ics .
What do they do with Ser@@ ti@@ ri@@ tics ?
And if you want to step up , you want to have a certificate , and you want to use this certificate , you want to use this certificate , you want to use this certificate .
We &apos;re using a lot of governments , and we &apos;re using lots of governments that are more popular like Iran , and yet , like governments like Iran , they use more than foreign governments , and they can use more than foreign governments , because they don &apos;t have any chance that they have to have access to their relationships .
But this is what &apos;s missing , and this is what &apos;s missing , and this is what &apos;s missing .
It &apos;s possible to distribute their company .
That &apos;s what happened to me .
How is it that you can see and see the head ?
So , in the year 2011 , there was a lot of documents that the secret police of the secret police have been lit up with its secret police .
And there was a long life of papers , &quot; &quot; F@@ IN@@ F@@ I@@ R . &quot; &quot; And this is the case in between , and there was an example of an in@@ verse event in the Germany , and it was the time that the company of the company , the government of all the rest of their citizens .
They had to sell these tools for 24,000 prey .
The first one of the companies is right here .
And so , the governments have given the tools to allow the governments to keep their partners under control of their foundation .
But the governments themselves do it .
For example , a few years ago , in Germany , the German Vi@@ king Vi@@ king Vi@@ ew , and it was organized by the German Democratic Party .
And if you &apos;re a comparison , it &apos;s all about it , and you &apos;re listening to your phone .
Now , that &apos;s the increase .
They &apos;re going to go away .
You can imagine Vi@@ king Vi@@ king computer , all the relationships , and you can imagine what the passwords are , and you know what the passwords are .
And so many of the people who are talking about that are probably probably saying , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not a good job , but I don &apos;t have a good job , but I don &apos;t have any effect .
Why am I nervous ?
I don &apos;t have anything . &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s very wrong .
My@@ stery is the dominant .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
It &apos;s not based on this security , and it &apos;s not based on the definition .
It &apos;s dependent on the scale and the damage .
And it &apos;s very good for the year 20@@ 1@@ 1@@ ago , and it &apos;s very good for us .
Would you ever be connected to the next 50 years ?
And the question is , and the questions that are going to happen in 50 years will have to be nervous .
( Music ) ( Applause )
And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; because I was 17 years row in June 17 .
And this is the first principle of the Earth kingdom , and this is the first principle of the Earth kingdom .
And my family and my friends were collecting me .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , why is it that you &apos;re here today , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , you know what you &apos;re here .
( Laughter ) Imagine you &apos;ve raised 17 years in the classroom , and imagine how much of your Mother behavior .
He told me , &quot; &quot; This is the object . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
And I looked at it , because I didn &apos;t know that my journey came from har@@ med har@@ ms .
When I was 17 years old , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , who cares about me ?
And then I realized that I had to deal with my self and smile .
He said , &quot; &quot; Yes , he &apos;s got to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to take you through the d@@ ash@@ board .
And it turns out that this is an image of the inspiration .
I &apos;d like you to think about the metaphor , and I want you to think about it .
My definition of mine begins in 197@@ 7 , when I witnessed two ne@@ ft tanks under the Golden G@@ ate , when I witnessed two ne@@ ft tan@@ kers , then half a mile .
And so I decided to use it so that I couldn &apos;t use the tools of steel .
This is a big thing for California .
It was a very big thing to get at the very small that I live in an In@@ ver@@ se Station , where I live in the winter of 71 years .
And I started walking around , and I started walking around , and I started walking around .
They said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do it ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Why do you do that ?
They were saying , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve been doing that , why do you still bring us down to why you don &apos;t succeed ? &quot; &quot; And when I walk around in the pajamas .
( Laughter ) Because , if you were to look at it from the point of view .
And I was talking about that , and I didn &apos;t talk to people about this .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gay .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use it anymore , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Why did you not have this 16 years old ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know what was happening at that time .
They lived in Philadelphia in Philadelphia .
And I said to my mother â€” &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t I need it if you &apos;re bored , &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re bored , they don &apos;t need to say that if you &apos;re bored .
So , I decided , in 2@@ 7@@ th birthday â€” lots of women and lots of friends â€” I decided , but I &apos;ve decided to talk about a daily daily basis .
So , I did this .
And I was talking about a lie in front of me .
And I am convinced that this was a beautiful experience to me because it was the first time I started listening to this until this first time .
And what I &apos;d like to expect was to think about me .
Because I &apos;ve always been listening to people , and I &apos;m listening to people , and I &apos;m listening to people , and I &apos;ve been listening to people , and I &apos;ve never heard about them .
And when I was talking about my advis@@ ant , I was thinking about what I &apos;d like to think about when I was talking about my advis@@ ant , and I was thinking about what I was talking about .
and then ...
And so that &apos;s how it works .
And that day , I was really religious .
And this was me because I understood that I didn &apos;t learn about these moments .
I had 27 years old , and I think I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
And so I studied this , and then I studied it , and it &apos;s been totally free . I promised myself that I was going to have a year sweater , and I needed it and I needed it .
So , I was a year talking about a year , and I thought , well maybe I started to start talking about some of the scientists that I &apos;ve discovered .
But this took 17 years .
I walked around 17 years , and I was going around 17 years , and I was trying to write and write and write and write .
And I think I need to get education .
I went to England , and I went to England , and they were there .
It &apos;s 800 miles .
And I went to the office , and what ?
I showed the fire on the side .
Ah , do you want to read ?
Right ?
We have a special program for the sky .
And after two years , after two years , after two years , it &apos;s very difficult to see .
He finally came up . She &apos;d come in .
And he said , &quot; &quot; My son , we &apos;re going to get you off , but we don &apos;t get to see what it &apos;s going on .
You didn &apos;t drive , if you don &apos;t speak , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You don &apos;t have to go , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I started walking around and started walking back .
And I came back to Washington T@@ wa@@ l , and I came back from the tree here , and I went back from the tree to Washington , and there was a place to go to Washington .
And two years ago , I wrote , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been amazed by January .
Two years wouldn &apos;t be dirty .
( Laughter ) And it happened to me . I had been educated in two years .
There are two stories of space .
The first one is that I had to see the park .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , why should I be nervous about this . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; When the morning comes back to me , &quot; &quot; he gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s like this one .
Did you go to South Asia ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said to him â€” There are weeks and lakes , like a hydr@@ o .
So I did this .
He said back to me , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Well , John , John , you can take the angle of the alarm , you can take the angle of the alarm .
And so what I think about all the professionals who are all professionals , they start to act .
And then it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to go , and then you dissolve it , and then you dissolve it . &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of time .
It was the big thing to help me .
And they would see that my memory was very clear to me , and they tried to get a village .
This tattoo , I would like to call it .
And when I was the first time in the room , there was 13 .
And my friend replied , &quot; &quot; My name is John , &quot; &quot; and my friend replied , &quot; &quot; My name is John J. , &quot; &quot; and I told them , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s not be more translation â€” that &apos;s the last lesson .
These are all the kinds of things that are on the road .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;d like time to go back to the point where I could get back .
But I had to tell them .
After two , he would have been working in our classes .
So I learned a lot of things â€” this kind of gestures .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try to call it &quot; &quot; â€” I don &apos;t know what â€” I don &apos;t know what to call the tree of the tree . Yeah , I think it &apos;s the tree of the tree . Yeah .
No , no . It &apos;s not that â€” it &apos;s a phenomenal example .
One of the most exciting things is .
You can do something .
No , he talks about the election .
So this debate was in the debate and we were discussing .
And I was back and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve gone away from this job .
But what I &apos;ve been studying is that I &apos;ve been able to find a sign that I had discovered , and sometimes I didn &apos;t know that I had a sign that I didn &apos;t know , but I had a sign that I had to do .
And I thought , if you &apos;re a teacher and explore , and if you don &apos;t learn anything , you don &apos;t have to say that if you don &apos;t learn anything .
So , I went on .
And my pa@@ stor came up with my head , and he said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to get a meeting , but ... &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to get the next , but ...
What do you think with my art ? &quot; &quot; So I took the desert , my bag of Wis@@ con@@ sin Wit@@ ten .
When I wrote a word about ne@@ ft tape , I was there .
Nobody was interested in ne@@ ft containers .
But what happened â€” Ex@@ peri@@ ary .
And I was amazed by the man who wrote about the World Cup duc@@ ts .
And then he came up with it .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to do that , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t know how to do that , you don &apos;t speak .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have to be an equation , because you &apos;ve got better jobs . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I got back up again .
It took my banjo , and I went back to the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean , waving my feet to the Atlantic Ocean for seven years .
And I started talking about the 200@@ th anniversary of the Earth .
So this is why I was trying to figure out that there &apos;s no such thing as a man , and it doesn &apos;t sound like that .
And I followed the lines and my family because they arrived .
And that &apos;s how it works .
And they taught me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to me â€” they were listening to
And that was something that came from this flower â€” and that was to listen to each other .
I really am â€” we need to listen to each other .
It continued .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is the object , &quot; &quot; and I haven &apos;t given it yet .
Now , I was working at the time of the B@@ attle of the B@@ attle of Bo@@ il@@ <unk> , N@@ M@@ aci@@ a .
I wrote the rules for America .
Twenty years ago , if anything was told to me , &quot; John , you want to have an awareness ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to be aware of it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Go to the right place , go to the East Side , and go to the right place , and go to the right place . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you want to know , &quot; &quot; and then they said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , you want to know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Anyway , you want to know .
How is it going to happen ? Right ?
How do you know about the simple things that are going on and to speak up ?
He had a beautiful day of Mahatma fighters .
And after that â€” I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been working , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go , &quot; &quot; and then I went back to a year , and then I went back to college , and I went to the whole point in the field .
So the point is that the reason I started to talk to you is why I started talking to you about why I started talking to you .
So , I started talking about the poetry of the singer , the tricky .
And this is the moment that we found that there was an extraordinary moment in the form of an un@@ for@@ gence .
And I was trying to figure out what it does , and I was talking about â€” and I was talking about what it does , and we &apos;re going to talk about what we &apos;re going to do .
And the fact that we don &apos;t have to see , and the fact that we don &apos;t have to have to be in the safety of the world , and the fact that we don &apos;t have to have to be in the world .
And if we don &apos;t cooperate , then we look at ourselves and see our behavior around us and see our behavior .
And that was a combination that I wanted to get to .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get to the rebel , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to my village , &quot; &quot; and I was going to come back to my visit â€” this was my time , and I started to walk around .
This story is the result of this story , and I realized that I had to use it not yet .
I used to circul@@ ated in El D@@ an â€” and I was amazed that I was amazed â€” I was amazed , and I didn &apos;t know what it was because I hadn &apos;t .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; P@@ har@@ b@@ ate , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; P@@ har@@ b@@ ate , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The P@@ har@@ m , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Me@@ mber of M@@ 16@@ -@@ . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; The P@@ har@@ m , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Me@@ mber , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Me@@ mber of M@@ 16@@ s . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; The P@@ har@@ m , &quot;
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; Pas@@ sion sport ?
I &apos;m not just showing up what I &apos;m going to show you , and it &apos;s in my bag .
I &apos;m the U.N. , the doctor , and I started around the world , and I watched around the world .
What did he make ?
It turned out to be 1908 .
They didn &apos;t .
What am I telling God , and I &apos;m amazed to see what I &apos;m saying ?
And after 150 miles , I found that , after 150 miles , it turns out that it &apos;s a product .
I was in the Middle East , and I had to open up .
So let me use my country to use the military medium .
What happens ?
Because when I started to use it , it would like to use it to me .
But it was the difference that I think I &apos;d never wanted to do with my own feet , but I don &apos;t want it to be used for my own feet .
And this is how I &apos;m going to be the G@@ MT morning .
I &apos;m not a professor .
And so I realized , just because I had another absolute revelation , and I had to change it .
You know , we can do it .
I was a change in the field .
And I was afraid of change , and I was afraid I was going to change it , because I was afraid I was going around the meeting .
Because , in order to teach the end of an end , we teach an end .
I didn &apos;t know who I was trying to .
But I could do it .
I could change it because I &apos;m not here today .
And I know , when we always want to think about ourselves , we always want to think about ourselves , but there are other places .
And what we &apos;re currently at , is that we have a new generation of who we have a new generation of who we have to have a new identity .
And I &apos;d like to urge you to come up with a journey that you can imagine â€” you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s the moment that you have to do something about it .
We are now changing .
We must be able to get a breath like K@@ in@@ sa .
And if my voice is to tell you , if I &apos;m amazed to tell you , if I &apos;m here to you , please please .
And I know , when I &apos;m here , you can see me .
I love it â€” that &apos;s the way that we put it in the world , and that &apos;s what it looks like â€” this is what we have to see here at TED that we have to see TED .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re not rational , and we act , and we act .
So , you &apos;re here , and I &apos;d like to close my light up to five seconds .
Thank you .

And you know , you know , when you cross one side of the United States , it gets closer and closer in the U.S. , and the question is , &quot; &quot; Do you want this block ?
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; This is the O@@ ak , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying .
This is 2@@ 9@@ th , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name is that &apos;s the name of this block ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not the name of blocks . &quot;
And there &apos;s the names , the blocks , the blocks of the blocks , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of a soul . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of a soul and metal .
Now , imagine if you could come up with the man on the horizontal side of it , and if you ask him , &quot; You know , if you &apos;re in Y@@ on@@ or , what &apos;s called ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This block is 17@@ th-century and says 16@@ th-century , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why are the names of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And so he says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t they name those numbers ? &quot; &quot; And then he says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t they name the names of the cube ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t they
They have names .
Google imagery . There are 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 , 17 .
There are all these blocks of blocks .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , how do you do homework ?
This is 17 and 17 and a half , &quot; &quot; Well , if you ask me , &quot; &quot; OK . So , when I walked around , I found that when I walked around , I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ ray .
The first one is the number of people in the world .
The second two is two , and then the number two is two .
This is a very mes@@ mer@@ y . This is the A@@ san@@ i and the light . &quot; &quot; Sometimes I love it , and I think it &apos;s one of the most amazing things that we don &apos;t really think about , to see if we don &apos;t have to think about it .
For example , these guys think that their job is to keep you healthy .
You &apos;re paying for the kids that you &apos;re paying for , and if you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re paying for some money , because they don &apos;t have any money in their interest in their work , because they &apos;re poor , you know , when you &apos;re sick .
( Applause ) And so , we are very , very often , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to start a tipping point . &quot; &quot; One , two , three .
But in Africa , the piece of music shows up a piece of music , which is the end of a sentence .
So , it &apos;s not just a matter of time , but you &apos;ll see it on the side . Number two , three .
And this map is true .
I &apos;m saying , well , there &apos;s this one I have to say about India , what you know about India .
You know , if you don &apos;t forget how much , you know , you have to forget about how much , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
