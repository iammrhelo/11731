It was a fall of 2005 .
I worked from scientific pro@@ ver@@ -@@ U , the Union by Li@@ v@@ ino &apos;s Day .
I was going to talk about my work , but precisely that day I felt a little bit un@@ excited .
So I found myself up to my fellow Chris Han@@ sen H@@ un@@ sen .
Chris took over 30 years to work at the A@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ U , so I knew how to work in the way of institutions .
I told my sister who felt a little bit brave .
I was researching a number of questions about the exact exact science of science and liber@@ ters : very interesting .
But I wanted to do the A@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ D approach to these problems , a way that could spark a difference .
( Applause ) Chris was direct to the big and ask me , &quot; &quot; All of these things , what are the five that most ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s the genetic discrimination , the reproductive technologies , the lawyers , and ...
You &apos;re also a great , the job of Isa@@ i@@ f as a det@@ orical , the art of Isa@@ i@@ f as a det@@ orical .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t , of course , the theme of the patent . &quot; &quot; Pat@@ agon@@ ists ?
&quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s the human genes of human genes . &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot;
I mean , saying that the average American government is telling the whole of the human body of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . I came back to my head , and I sent him to three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he got him by a little bit .
&quot; Hell ! You had the right ! How do you have to keep it ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s Chris : ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a big one , but it didn &apos;t know almost anything about patent troll and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t a lot of a de@@ de@@ de , much less car@@ rot@@ ated troll .
It was clear that there was a lot to learn before to just stop someone else .
First , we had to know exactly exactly what the patent was called when somebody pat@@ ched a gene .
The patents used to be used to be able to make a du@@ bious version of reclaiming outrage , or whether it &apos;s a piece of DNA that &apos;s actually a DNA piece of cell .
The defenses I say this , don &apos;t patent your body &apos;s genes , patent your body &apos;s genes , and it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s more the thing that you need to take the genes to use them .
And the patent doesn &apos;t break a gene on particular , but every single skeleton &apos;s brain is actually .
And what does this mean ?
Because you can &apos;t pass your genes to your doctor and ask me that you know , to see if you have any other , without the defen@@ seless of the patent .
It also means the troll from patent is the right to stop that gene is right now to stop in research or trials .
And so , to look at these offic@@ e-@@ of homes , I &apos;ve been able to close the parts of the human human being di@@ ability .
We have the case of Ab@@ ul@@ ana , a little 10 years with C@@ PR syndrome , a heart disease that is , if it &apos;s not , it can cause death .
The company that lets the two genes associate with this disease made a test for diagnosing a test .
But then he went to the freeway and never come to offer cell phones .
But the company that could have been the money that had been the loss , but the company that could kill the weapon or stopped by in@@ stable to patent to patent the patent .
Two years without going to make the test .
During that time , Ab@@ <unk> died from I.Q.
The patents was a problem that has been a problem with patients .
Will I ever have any way to do it ?
Because it turns out that the Supreme Court stopped in a long list of cases , that there is a number of things that are not pat@@ ented .
You can &apos;t make the products of nature : air , water , minerals , the elements of the good table .
They don &apos;t even know the laws of the nature of gravity , and the law is .
I are very crucial , and you need to be the very fundamental reach of all , and you need to be the reach of all , and it &apos;s just a lot of fundamental things , and you need to be right .
In our view DNA , the structure of life is more fundamental , that encode the production of all our protein , is so much a product of nature like a nature of nature , regardless of which you find and our bodies or the bottom of a lab .
To report the best , we traveled through the country to talk about the whole country : scientists , medical physicians , car@@ o@@ chi@@ e fraud , de@@ mor@@ o@@ chi@@ e .
Most of us told us we were right there to a political point of political view , and when it &apos;s less in theory , from a legal point of view .
They all thought the chance to go through our own topic of our topic were so much like a scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the patent troll will lead to these 15@@ .5 year-old ratio .
It was literally thousands of human genes .
The patent court was very tied in the status quo , the scheme of bio@@ se@@ se@@ se@@ ment , and the mechanism for pro@@ longed the patents to pro@@ longed this practice , and the IT counselor would propose the patent to the Congress , without going to be gone .
I presume , the courts weren &apos;t going to be willing to cor@@ ular these patents .
But I wasn &apos;t Chris and I don &apos;t think of it , and that &apos;s the thing that the hell , and that &apos;s the reason , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m right , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s why not enough , but it &apos;s not enough , but it &apos;s not enough to follow .
So we started to look at our cause .
The judge per capita is used to be : Tra@@ iled fund@@ -@@ si@@ ders for some of the subject , and the expectation is , the dark and messy .
We didn &apos;t get interested in that kind of causes , we think our cause can make a lot more .
So the foundation of science , the progress and the patient &apos;s doctor .
So we decided to open a cause that would not be like the British are there by patents , but one cause of the Neanderthals .
We &apos;ve managed to identify a memoir from patents that we have to defend the insec@@ t-@@ or-@@ per@@ bed troll system , and the experts that would tell the courts as these patents act as these patents acts of patients and innovation .
So the ideal candidate for stopped by opening was My@@ re@@ ic@@ o , a company with a headquarters in Sal@@ t Lake City , U@@ h .
My@@ pos@@ eful to the patent of two genes , the genes B@@ R@@ A and the B@@ R@@ 2 .
Women with certain other genes are likely to have the best ones in these genes in your chest and .
A full mon@@ gering on the top of B@@ CR@@ America &apos;s case in the United States .
They were so many of them to offer me to the CR@@ CR@@ A test test .
We have many money for their exams : more than 3,000 dollars .
They stopped sharing their data clinical data with international community community .
And if I take the worse , for a couple of years , My@@ ri@@ ging deser@@ tifying its exam to act its exam so that included a million researchers in France .
It moved that during that period , for several years , until a 12 percent of women are going to do the top answer : a bad outcome that should be positive .
This is K@@ h@@ le@@ man M@@ ax@@ .
K@@ h@@ le@@ lions are , E@@ ile@@ en , developed cancer , has been developed cancer for 40 years and fixed exams .
The test was negative .
The family ro@@ mmed .
The most likely was that cancer cancer would not present in the family , so the other family members of the family didn &apos;t need to do the exam .
But two years later , K@@ h@@ le@@ man diagnosed a cancer cancer in state of a state of living in the state .
It turns out that the K@@ le@@ le@@ d-@@ in Swa@@ hil@@ arily , has been found among that 12 percent of people who are blogging a fake .
If E@@ ile@@ en got the result right now , K@@ h@@ ack@@ en would have done the exam , and we would avoid his hero of S@@ av@@ ana .
So that includes , to be able to show that they will be able to propel these problems .
We are sequ@@ ul@@ ers , of course , four scientific loans that are taught to have the highest scientific developments of scientific , and medical women , and individual women who were going to have no way to pay the examination by My@@ ri@@ r , or a second point that they couldn &apos;t afford to afford to afford to pay for the patent .
One of the main ones that face when we prepare this case was to think the way that we think about science .
To the case that what I &apos;ve done was I was going to vote was not a seat , and the genes usually ends B@@ CA was nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concep@@ tually , like : What is a gene ? What is the DNA ?
So what if the DNA island , and why is it not a seat ?
We spend hours of hours and hours of our ship and experts , trying to do the way we think we can do the way we think of explaining these things of a lot more messy .
And at the end end of the metaph@@ orical metaph@@ orical metaph@@ ors , like gold .
So we then look at it is like to extract gold from a range of a combination or from the river of a river .
We allow the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t actually patho@@ -@@ per@@ ding the meaning .
So it &apos;s still working , and it &apos;s still going to pull the gold back . There &apos;s no way to do it , it &apos;s going to be gold .
And the gold , once , once we can make all sorts of things that you couldn &apos;t even walk when he was in the mountain ; with him , he can make a nice , for example . But you can &apos;t make the gold , because it &apos;s going to be gold .
In the 2009 we were already listed to the case .
We &apos;ve shown that we &apos;ve done this before the district district district district district in New York City , and the case has been un@@ locks , the ch@@ ari@@ ma named S@@ P@@ et .
In 2010 , the judge &apos;s we@@ k@@ et issued his memoir : 15@@ 2 pages . A complete complete assault for us .
When we read their view , it &apos;s really frightening us to describe the science in the case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could they develop an understanding of the subject in the way that little time ?
We couldn &apos;t imagine how they were going to be possible .
So it turned out that the insi@@ th-@@ makers of the S@@ we@@ et S@@ we@@ et of that , it wasn &apos;t just a little bit old .
And it wasn &apos;t just a scientist — I had a Ph@@ .@@ D in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Pretty lucky .
So I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be asked with the E@@ ell@@ ell@@ ation of the license of the Fi@@ ir@@ a .
And here &apos;s the thing .
First of this is a life that &apos;s a life vital government , the government of the United States changed .
In the court court , government issued a report to pro@@ longed My@@ sus@@ en .
But in direct action to your own container and the government of the patent , the government present a report that would re@@ consider this subject to the light of the court &apos;s court &apos;s court &apos;s court , and then it would surprise the DNA course not to be pat@@ ented .
This was very important , and utterly unexpected .
The E@@ el@@ de of the C@@ ir@@ ck C@@ ru@@ c has to lead all of the satellite cases , and it &apos;s its way it &apos;s very , very , very , very patent .
So even with this particular event , we would not just lose .
And so it was .
More or less .
The decision was from two to one .
But the most won@@ d-@@ educated who voted against us , they did so completely different .
The first one , the Christian , the Lou@@ e , has created his own and a new theory , totally wrong .
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
My@@ v@@ ging argued that , why didn &apos;t I have a sense .
The other one , the fact , the fact that the hell , the fact that I agree with that the DNA is actually a product of nature .
But I don &apos;t want to walk into the biotech industry , so the third , the judge on the top of the top , gave us the reason .
You have to make a question that you &apos;re going to respond to the court that you &apos;re going to respond to the court .
The general , general , questions like a massive superpower , a way of a ste@@ e@@ tic container and a lot of them .
We did what if home was the most short-@@ heard they received .
Five words : Am I pat@@ ented genes ?
When I asked my questions , I asked the question of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think you would have to say , &quot; &quot; Are you a sto@@ wed DNA ? &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
I want the judges that have the same reaction that I had the day to me , about seven years . &quot; &quot; And of course , I mean , I mean ?
The Supreme Court Court goes around and around one percent of the cases that are being , and then stayed it up our .
And he comes the day of the tor@@ al failures of the fact that it was very , very exciting — with many people out there , people who were tied to the two : 30 of the way to try to get into the judged .
It includes cancer cancer cells , they have organized an expression to judge the judge on the judge .
Chris and I took together in the hallway , moments before he had to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he .
But all of that , it turns out when I came to the room and saw me a lot of ar@@ ar@@ ous ar@@ ar@@ ous ar@@ ar@@ ous ar@@ ar@@ ous ar@@ ar@@ ous ad@@ jec@@ tives : women who knew and had had their stories , the genetici@@ sts who sacrific@@ ed their histories , the genetici@@ sts of a spectrum , the genetici@@ st of a spectrum , the genetici@@ st of a spectrum that we present from the court of court to be able to make it , representatives of a spectrum that we present
In the room , they were also three leaders of the Human Gen@@ om@@ it@@ ome Project , including the co-@@ est of DNA , James Watson , who had this written to the court , what would we say that the genes was a nearby , and the diversity of communities in the room and the contribute that each one to do this day would have a lot of the way we had to play .
The claim was engaging .
Chris claimed a brilliant way .
But to me , the most passionate thing was to see the Supreme Court &apos;s Supreme Court &apos;s Supreme Court &apos;s Supreme Court to play with the current DNA of the world , and dialo@@ gues , in a very similar way , like I &apos;ve done our legal team for the last seven years .
The adult gained in the isolation of DNA with the isolated plant with the DNA plant of the Amazon .
The judge Rob@@ er@@ ts that will reveal this to make a baseball plate from a tree .
And what I &apos;m not just in my favorite moment was the adult S@@ ot@@ om@@ ay@@ or that the DNA ends &quot; &quot; or that DNA &quot; &quot; was nature to expect . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we first came from the judge that were really hard to do .
A natural natural pig is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not restricted to being pat@@ ented just because outside .
And what &apos;s more , My@@ h@@ r did not do nothing . &quot; &quot; Twenty-@@ four hours after the decision , five letters announced that they would start offering to offer the advice to the genes B@@ CA .
Some of them probably had some poin@@ t-@@ used exams to My@@ ri@@ r .
Some promise to offer a more ex@@ us@@ ha@@ d-@@ using tracking test that offer a comm@@ enting on .
But the decision of the court was to be overweight by My@@ ri@@ r .
I strapped into a 25@@ -year-old practice that lets us allow the human genes in the United States .
It &apos;s called at@@ om@@ at@@ ons , or at@@ <unk> or biomedical research .
And what patients like Ab@@ in , K@@ h@@ le@@ man and E@@ ile@@ en and E@@ ile@@ en are the test they needed .
A week later after that court , he had a small package of his decision , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email , a small package of the email
She was Bob C@@ ro@@ -@@ Face , a teacher from Du@@ ke University and one of the first people that I and Chris went to me and Chris , and I went to Bob C@@ ro@@ -@@ Face , a teacher from Du@@ ke University .
( Laughter ) We have a lot of this case .
Some of what you gave you to address those risks is to know that we were doing the right thing .
The process lasted nearly eight years since the end of the end , with many of them and we got to do it as a way .
Of course , lucky , but they were the communities that we put together , and the memories we create , the ones we create , the ones we &apos;ve created , the ones we &apos;ve created , the ones we create , the ones we &apos;ve created , the ones we create , the ones we &apos;ve created , the ones we create , the ones we &apos;ve created , the ones we create , the ones we &apos;ve created , the ones we create , the ones we &apos;ve created , the ones we create , the
Thank you .
( Applause )
O@@ la . Today , I &apos;m going to show you some p@@ ine@@ -@@ ons of eight of my projects , made in collaborative media with a Danish artist .
We have to call Por@@ x@@ us &amp; R@@ R@@ en and we live and we work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , when I call &quot; &quot; The phone &quot; &quot; — I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; The phone guy . &quot; &quot; I told me that it makes me a lot of fun of him because he &apos;s almost like I was a while she was a while she was a while she &apos;s an extension of his body , she gl@@ ued the lights or take a pot or a weed or a weed or smoking .
When I was I was the worst , the worst was the worst , to see how a way .
Of course , I couldn &apos;t say anything , because the guy is a very de@@ mor@@ t-@@ knit figure in the time .
What I was most of my was , and she was his use of the phone use .
He would take the au@@ th@@ od and I would expect me to get the number of one letter by him .
As a gift and how gift to my man , I said , &quot; &quot; The phone guy . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they &apos;re actually really poor people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way that my man uses a phone call for a person .
The problem is that when I went home and I went to college , I started to take the air of least your commands .
So I &apos;ve done this machine writing machine with that he could take your plate to sound sound and sound sounds around the world through the Neanderthals .
What I had to do was take a paper , put paper on the car , write the email , write the email or take the paper .
This device would send automatically the person in a matter of a lot of electronic email .
Here you see that we put a lot of these little bits that are understood all the Neanderthals and our heritage and the digital world .
So my particular man is just a mechanical interface .
And since then , the object has to be a ru@@ g@@ able touch touch , like my uncle .
The next job is a device to sound that sound called &quot; &quot; The P@@ ig@@ me@@ tics . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the way that we are surrounded by a beautiful sense of shy creatures , sensitive to the awkward and swee@@ g@@ .
This works like this . We have these t@@ apes here on the wall and behind , we have these little creatures that are the soil underground .
Instead we &apos;re going to fall silence , inti@@ mi@@ dy .
And if there &apos;s a more silence yet , they make the fisher@@ man .
And at the very least , you can play again .
So we have these flies in three walls of a room .
And we had some 500 of these little pigments that were lying behind .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a video clip .
When there &apos;s silence , however , the Moon behind the Moon is the rou@@ t@@ angle of the Moon .
They are and they are like humans or real creatures .
And they &apos;re also the sounds of sound that scare them out of there .
They don &apos;t get to the sound sound .
I hear a train in a moment when they don &apos;t get it .
( Laughter ) But they are actually the sounds at the sound at the first plan . I hear that a second .
( Laughter ) We worked hard to do the more realistic thing possible .
Each pig@@ ment has its own behavior , and the same changes of humor , etc .
This is a very dirty thing .
So , of course , it was the best after that .
They were told people , but we saw that people was a lot like young Africans and child .
This is a video video video game called &quot; &quot; The person who &apos;s missed . &quot; &quot; We were quite intrigued by the idea of the game .
How would it be possible to experiment to the heck ?
We worked with a specific company in the laboratory cameras , and we asked them that software , with a camera that could look at the people in the room , follow these people , and replace a person with the bottom , the in@@ defen@@ ts .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ll show you a very strange one .
The right thing , you can see my colleague in a stri@@ de , which is in space .
And the left , the whole process of which the camera is where the camera makes the invisible .
He goes on the fourth room . F@@ und@@ <unk> .
You can see how the camera goes down and the brake .
It &apos;s a little bit , so we don &apos;t get to let the tail and all of it , but it &apos;s perfect , but it &apos;s perfect .
So we did this by a room where a camera was looking at space and we had a monitor on every wall .
And second people went to the room , see themselves in the monitor , but by a person , a person was constantly invisible to where they are going to move into the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The wall of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a paper of paper , like a little bit of a one-@@ by-@@ one of a water@@ l@@ ment of a oil bottle or a sun .
Anyway , this object seemed to be very strong and robust , and on the side , almost too .
People would walk through the room and almost the ignored and almost the dis@@ thought of thinking was some of them in some trac@@ ted stra@@ ins .
But instead later went into black , I would start to kick out the way by the wall in the way .
It will keep it up and un@@ addicted to it .
( Laughter ) This work is a car@@ ta , a car@@ i@@ tic man of a set@@ back .
Her head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , which seems that it &apos;s growing and in its dec@@ ust , its bodies grows up as a plant .
What it does is move around your head as if you &apos;re a car@@ o@@ chi@@ al movement in a very beautifully un@@ stable movement .
It &apos;s like thank you so much that circle .
Because if that circle doesn &apos;t have the soil out there and the soil outside , it would start to de@@ mi@@ ze space .
And there &apos;s no way there .
So I &apos;ll show you an example . When people comes in the room , it turns out that .
And so , very slowly , in a minute , it &apos;s going to make it easier , gets speed and looks like it &apos;s the point of the coin .
This is a important moment because we could actually in@@ merge into the viewer a way to go and help or save the ru@@ g@@ .
But he didn &apos;t have it because he even is who he had again .
This work was an authentic technical challenge to us and we work very hard , like in the most of our ages , for years to get a mechanical ventilation , and a perfect head@@ ch@@ eri@@ ch@@ eri@@ ch@@ eri@@ ch@@ .
It was very important for us to be accurate the moment accurate and it &apos;s going to change the way that balance the balance , then we would use it , and if it didn &apos;t have a little bit of that fat@@ alism , or that effect of wanting to go to the help .
So I &apos;ll show you a very quick video where we make a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . Let &apos;s go .
Now it &apos;s also the way it &apos;s going to take .
But you don &apos;t need to do it because it &apos;s actually itself .
This is a work that we &apos;ve been very intrigued by , working with the incredible skin of the skin and the vast fo@@ ids of optical fiber , and it weighed like the sky seats .
And it &apos;s the scale of the sky and the sky .
This is around a place around a drop form of a glass form , which was pasted from the ap@@ self .
The idea was to be really cold , and so I &apos;m very cold , and I &apos;m comfortable with a lot of a ra@@ b of a ra@@ b , which is very un@@ comfor@@ ting and intimate .
The idea was that somewhere we &apos;d let you see the way that a lot of the ra@@ b and almost the outer pods , as if you were looking at a little night , as if you were looking at a brilliant spot , I like you &apos;re looking at a brilliant concert .
This is the last job , even in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ref@@ er@@ he@@ ur . &quot; &quot; Imagine a big cover that you can see in the middle of the room , and that , you &apos;ll find a bio@@ grap@@ hical type of a single drop in a cube twice and of the width of its volume .
This object is in constant expan@@ backs and counter-@@ counter-@@ funding to create a small tu@@ ft of people around it , like you try to play a secret in your own together or something like this .
We worked with a lot of technology , but it really doesn &apos;t like the way it , because it &apos;s a very way of suffering in our work for years and years .
But we use because we are in the way that helps us express emotions and patterns of behaviors in these creatures that we create .
When a creature comes to the mind , and almost as if the process of creation was finding the way that this creature wants to exist , that way wants to take and like if it wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I &apos;m going to start by giving you a trick with really technology technology and all the corner of you , is this : you change your posture for two minutes .
But before I tell you , I want to ask you now even if your body looks like your body and you &apos;re doing it with it .
( Laughter ) So how many of you are going to be some kind of kind of like you ?
Di@@ ver@@ shly , the legs rose , the ph@@ thal@@ o@@ chi@@ ts .
We sometimes put the gifts .
Sometimes I would blend it . ( Laughter ) O@@ fle I see you .
I pay attention to what I &apos;m right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this in a couple minutes , and hopefully you &apos;re going to modify it a little bit , and I hope you &apos;re going to modify it a little bit about the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re fascinated with body language and inter@@ severe age , especially the body language of other people .
You know , I was a little bit — this , I &apos;m sorry — ( Laughter ) a tor@@ pe , a painter , a s@@ ra@@ ous eye , a ch@@ ick@@ hear@@ ted look like a tor@@ rent of a ch@@ ack@@ hear@@ ted eye , or even something like a pair of hands .
Narrator : So here are coming to the number 10 .
This police must be lucky and gave him to the president of the United States .
There he comes the first minister ... ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy C@@ dy : A hand@@ bag , a pair of hands , or his audi@@ ble , can you tell us for weeks and weeks ; you can take the first year to go to weeks for weeks .
The New York Times was really right and the BBC and New York Times .
So when we think about whether or not verbal language or body language , we talk about language , we talk about language , so much of communication .
When we talk about communication , we think we need to think about interactions .
What are me that poor body language ?
What are you telling me ?
There &apos;s why there &apos;s why this is true this thing .
The stakes are a lot of time or other people , about the Jewish judgment .
We make the ability and the language of body language .
That empowering can be important in life as we hire or we promote or who we &apos;re asking or who we &apos;re asking .
For example , I was in the U.S. , researcher at the University of T@@ ar , demonstrated that when somebody touches 30 seconds of videos are no of any patient of any patient of any other than any of the medical interactions of the doctor &apos;s democracy about that doctor &apos;s saying it &apos;s going to be stopped or not .
So it doesn &apos;t have to see so much with the doctor was or not in@@ skilled but with the person like it or they like they or they like that person or they like .
But even more dramatic , Alex Tom@@ orrow , Alex , to come to the United States , shown in the last 70 percent of the career of political candidates I &apos;ve learned in a second 70 percent of the time of the career &apos;s leading career in the air , and the U.S. and the same , the pre@@ crastin@@ ators , the pre@@ crastin@@ ators , the appropriate ones in the Valley can lead to more value to that negotiation .
If you do that as you do a bad use of them is bad idea , right ?
Tran@@ verbal language is not verbal : you talk about how we judge to others , how are you judged and what are the hell of it .
But we tend to forget the other audience in which it involves our language , not verbal , that we are ourselves .
We are increasingly changing our language , we are not verbal , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
What are hell aren &apos;t verbal right now ?
I &apos;m social media . I &apos;m going to contribute the harm of the business of business , so it was inevitable that I was inevitable that I was inevitable that we were able to get interested in power .
It &apos;s been regarded as all of the world &apos;s invisible pressures and dominated .
What are the express of the lack of power and dominated ?
Well , yeah , they are .
And in the animal kingdom , you have to see the expansion , and the animal kingdom has to look at it .
We &apos;re going to get big , un@@ settling , con@@ ver@@ sec@@ ting , you &apos;re basically open , you &apos;re basically open to you .
It &apos;s about opening up .
And it works in all the animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom , and it works in the whole animal kingdom ,
You don &apos;t only have the prime .
Humans do it . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re so when they have power in permanent ways and also when we make powerful in the moment .
This is especially interesting because we &apos;ve shown that ancient and universal are the fact that these are the self-@@ fulfilling power of power .
This phrase , as a choos@@ -up , was studied by ta@@ sty i@@ ries , and this expression , as a man , as a swimmer , was studied by i@@ bia , and a tor@@ rent of a man , as a child , as a swimmer , and a tor@@ rent of a man , a man like mine , who was a slave for Fi@@ x , and this expression , as a man , as a swimmer , was studied by i@@ bia , and a tor@@ rent of a man , as a
I told you that so much the people that you see since that very much , that tells us that so many people who are just who are born as they are , they do the same as the people who are seeing themselves as the people who are who are who they are who are who are who they are who are who are who they are who are who are who are who they are who are who are who are who they are who are who are who are who they are who are who are
So when you look at the end line , and win no matter if you &apos;ve never seen one person .
They &apos;re like that .
The Neanderthals in V V , the heart , the one , is a very high thing .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We take the opposite .
We &apos;re going to get . We &apos;ll get out .
We have small .
We don &apos;t want to meet with who is our .
And so the animals like humans do the same .
And this is what happens when we started power .
What we tend to do is when it comes to power is actually actually actually by the verbal language of others .
So if somebody is really powerful to us , we tend to do the smaller ones . Don &apos;t accept it .
We do the opposite .
If I can see this behavior in class , what is it ?
In the last year , the students from M@@ ap@@ e@@ ming all the real language of power are no verbal .
There are people who are car@@ elessly car@@ elessly , come in class , places in the middle and the way they start class , like , as if they wanted to take space .
When they sit , they seem to expand .
Er@@ nest your hand .
So there are other people who come to us to get rid of the re@@ servation .
You see it in his trunk and his body , sit in the chair and then sit there and then they follow the hand .
So here &apos;s two things .
One will not doubt you .
I think it &apos;s just a little bit about sex .
Women are more likely to do it that men .
The se@@ in@@ ous female always always be more powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that we &apos;ve noticed that we have been linked to the record of the students and with its level of action .
And this is really important in the middle class of M@@ and@@ ma , because it measures the media for the media .
The business schools have been fighting with the distinction of notes .
You see , and men equally , and I think , the differences in the notes , that seem to be attributed to the difference .
So I started asking me , if there are people who come to that aff@@ ap@@ -@@ free experience , and make a difference , if there are people who come to that particular disconnect and make a difference , if there are people who come to that particular disconnect and make a difference , if there are people who come to that particular disconnect and make a difference , if there are people who come to that particular disconnect and make a difference , if there are people who come to that particular disconnect and make a difference
What would it take you to do that other matter is possible to do other things , and that leads them to the more ?
My collaborator De@@ ana Car@@ ney , which is in Berkeley , and I &apos;m sure you can &apos;t know if you can &apos;t get it .
So , can you do just for a moment and try a result in your behavior that makes it feel more powerful ?
We know that language doesn &apos;t understand verbal language condi@@ tional from other people , and they think of ourselves , there &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question was : condi@@ tional language condi@@ tional , why do we feel it and think of ourselves ?
There &apos;s a test test test .
For example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but also when we &apos;re forced to laugh , a ja@@ b with the teeth that are so painful to the teeth that are so happy .
It works in the two directions .
When it comes to power , it &apos;s also working in the two directions .
When we feel powerful , it &apos;s more likely that this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we pretend to be powerful , it &apos;s more likely that really in the modern heritage .
Well , the second question was really , well , we know that the mind mo@@ locks our body , but it &apos;s okay , but it &apos;s okay , the language does your mind ?
And when I say , in the case of powerful , I &apos;m talking about it ?
Because I talk about thoughts and feelings and emotional therap@@ ists that make these thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about hormones .
How is it the mind of powerful people &apos;s mind with the ones that are not ?
The powerful people tend to be , not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , more optimistic .
They have the sense they &apos;re going to be really in games .
They also tend to think of a more abstract way .
There &apos;s a lot of differences in a lot of differences . It &apos;s going to be more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of difference in the powerful differences among powerful and the ones that are not .
We also have the differences in two key hormones : testosterone , which is the hormone hormone , and the cut it , it &apos;s the hormone hormone .
The males are very empowered in the patho@@ logists of the prime hunters that have high levels of testosterone and low low , and powerful leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and economic leaders and effective , and powerful leaders and effective , and the low-@@ un@@ cles , and the very powerful leaders and effective leaders of the <unk> ol and
What does this mean ? By the way of power , it used to be just a way of testosterone , because I had to see with the dominance of the circumstance .
But power also has to do with our reaction to stress .
We want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with a high levels of testosterone , but as we know ?
Have you not , right ?
We want a person who &apos;s powerful , and it &apos;s dominant , but not very much stress , a person who &apos;s reas@@ quiet .
We know that in the prime of the prime , if a car has to take control , if somebody has to take control , take a sudden , take a sudden , take a lot of time in the run of a days , his very dirty , un@@ lar@@ u@@ re-@@ ously morally morally morally out .
We have that evidence , that the body can det@@ onate the mind , unless the paper can det@@ ached the mind , unless the paper can det@@ onate the mind .
So what happens when you take a paper change ? What &apos;s going on if you do at a minimum level , like this small manipulated or inter@@ wins ?
We let it go , &quot; &quot; I want you for two minutes you &apos;re so , that will make you feel the most powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to make people the lab and do a little experiment , those people adopted them , for two minutes , both of the possibly possible may be able to show you just five of those scenes from those scenes , even if they were given just two of those parking suits , and still they were just two of those scenes from the same , even if they were given two .
This is one .
A couple more more than one pair of a pair of one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus
So , the press called &quot; &quot; The S@@ eller &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; he wonder . &quot; &quot; And this is the press called &quot; &quot; The S@@ cri@@ mate fatigue . &quot; &quot; And this is the press called &quot; &quot; The S@@ cri@@ mate fatigue . &quot; &quot; And this is the press called &quot; &quot; The S@@ cri@@ mate fatigue . &quot; &quot; And this is the press called &quot; &quot; The S@@ cri@@ mate fatigue . &quot; &quot; And this is the press called &quot; &quot; The S@@ cri@@ mate fatigue . &quot;
So here we have a couple more .
You can be standing , or sitting .
This is the odds of weakness .
Now , you &apos;re going to get a little bit .
This is very low power .
When I was in the fisheries you &apos;re going to protect it , really .
This is what happens .
They come , co@@ blin in a jar , and we say we had two minutes , and we said , &quot; &quot; You have to do this or that . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the box .
We don &apos;t want to make any harm with a power .
We want to feel the power .
They &apos;re this two minutes .
So we asked , &quot; &quot; How does it feel like that , how powerful you feel ? &quot; &quot; We gave them the chance of bet , and we gave them the chance to bet that we would rather be able to put it in the end of it .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experiment .
This is what we found .
T@@ im@@ ic@@ ations at risk , we could find that when they are in a high power position , we found that when we go to the 86 percent of the high power .
When they are in the low-@@ low-@@ under the low-@@ , it &apos;s going to be a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s see what we found with testosterone .
It &apos;s about their normal situation to get , the powerful people , an amazing speed of 20 percent and the lawyers have an effect on 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and they get that change .
Now the results of cutting .
The most powerful thing to experience a 25 percent of the most insi@@ ries , the most striking people , the most striking rise in the 15 percent .
Just two minutes of lead these hormon@@ al change , that &apos;s the test your brain to make it be safe , secure or comfor@@ ting or comfor@@ ting as the stress of the stress , and the way you look like me .
All of the feeling , yeah ?
I think our language doesn &apos;t mean verbal language re@@ acts the way of seeing ourselves , not just to the rest of it , but the same thing .
The body can change the mind .
So the next question , of course , is — can a millimeter that &apos;s a five-@@ minute power of life ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , they &apos;re just two minutes .
Where do you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what we care about .
We think where you need to have in the case of that , in the case of the social media , you think , how are you in the context of what you are in , how are you in the context of your life , how are you in the context of your life , how are you in the context of your life , how are you in the context of your life , how are you in the context of your life , how are you in the context of your life , how are you
What you would tell you is that the men in the middle that are just in the ones that are given your friends .
For adolescents is in the table of the comedian &apos;s dining table .
For some people , it &apos;s about the Som@@ ali school .
It can be to be a business or a talk about how this or going to go a job interview .
We take a with the most people who identi@@ fies it because many of them went on , the interview interview .
So what do we do , the media was , and the media was , well , this is what we have to do when we &apos;re going to be an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to sound like this and you say , not , God , God , no , no , no , no , no .
For a lot of reason , it &apos;s not , not let .
Again , it &apos;s not about talking to other people .
You want to talk to you .
What do we do to go back to an interview interview interview ?
You &apos;re sitting there . Look at your iPhone ... or your Android , you don &apos;t let anybody out there .
We were the text of texting , you &apos;re getting rid of it , really , really , when you really should be doing it , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s worth a ? I &apos;m going to do two minutes .
So that &apos;s what we want to assess , right ?
We invited people to the lab , and then raise high-@@ low and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power and low power
We were recorded of five minutes of months of mega-@@ time .
Also , they are judged on judged and the judges are not just by giving them not verbal damage .
Imagine that this person you interview .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you are trans@@ mit@@ ing .
People would do this .
It &apos;s what Mari@@ anne &apos;s call &quot; &quot; being in the middle of the &quot; &quot; social media . &quot; &quot; This fires the cut .
This is the interview with the logo , because you see what it happened .
We have Neanderthals together , four in total .
They don &apos;t know how to chance . We don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have any idea that you have a person who has every person and at the end of the Neanderthals , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all the time they have .
We don &apos;t want to hire other .
We give a much more positive positive for you .
It &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
It &apos;s the presence of the presence of the speech .
Why do we measure all these variation in the competition to compete , we would be going to be a good speech ?
Did you look good ? What do you do ?
These things don &apos;t affect affecting this stuff and what it does .
So this kind of thing .
Each person gets itself , basically .
They show what they are .
They show their ideas themselves , themselves , without any extra extra .
So this is what it causes or conditioned to effect .
When I talk to people about this , our bodies changes our mind and behavior can change our way of being , saying , &quot; &quot; It looks like . &quot; &quot; Oh ?
I said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s going to do the action .
I &apos;m not like this .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel as a impos@@ tor .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that he wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is really important for me , because I want to tell you a little story about being a impos@@ tor and how you felt like it wasn &apos;t there .
When I was 19 , I had a terrible car accident .
I &apos;m going to get some steps back and then some of his hands .
I &apos;m going to get my car out of the car .
I hope I hope I &apos;m going to dive into a pot in a head , and I told my students from college , and said my C@@ .D. fell two standard devi@@ ations . It was a lot of traumatic .
I know my C@@ Q because they &apos;ve been told me as a super-@@ gifted , and I think as a scientist , I know , as a super-@@ gifted , and I think I was told .
So I graduated from university and tried back .
I said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t end the career .
You have to make some other things things you can do , but in your case it doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And so I said to you , &quot; &quot; We have to deal with that , what you really can take you , what you really are , and I have to say that to you , that &apos;s the most im@@ potent thing can be to make sense .
I was totally powerless .
So he and he and he smiles and he smiles and he smiles and he smiles and he &apos;s lucky , and he &apos;s angry .
I graduated from college .
I was older than four years older than my partners , and I was saying , my ang@@ le@@ o , Ms. K@@ ake , so that I &apos;m not going to accept someone , and I felt like I wasn &apos;t there .
The night before the earthquake came up , he was , the night before the earthquake , and the night before the earthquake , he was , the night before the earthquake , and the night before the earthquake , the night , the night , the time of the time , and the night before the earthquake , he was , the night before the earthquake , and the night before the earthquake , the night , the night , the time of the time , and the night before the earthquake , he was , the night
That &apos;s the way .
I had so much fear of the entire worm coming the next day that I was called and said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll leave it . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t let me go , because I put you and go .
V@@ ices , and this is what we &apos;re going to do .
You see them all the pre@@ conceptions that you &apos;ll ever take .
It &apos;s just to do , and do it , and do it , and then we did it , and then we were star@@ tled or even par@@ alized as a dig@@ estion of the fact that the &quot; &quot; Ar@@ re Sh@@ as@@ er , &quot; &quot; which is .
I got up to this . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years of record a few years ago , you know , in Nor@@ shi@@ at@@ ard , I &apos;m now at the United States , I &apos;m now at Harvard , I &apos;m not interested in this but a lot of time I &apos;ve had the sensation that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
So my first year at Harvard , a student who hadn &apos;t talked to the class in the whole of the bar@@ ge , and that said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have to participate or you &apos;re going to be &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; Termin@@ al , &quot; &quot; he came up with my day . I didn &apos;t know before .
T@@ ech@@ ing was beat , he should not be here .
That was my moment .
Because they were given two things .
The first one I realized : who@@ a ! I don &apos;t feel so much .
I didn &apos;t feel like that , but she sat me down in his place .
The second was , of course , has been there !
We go , and it can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , yeah . Yes you &apos;re you . &quot;
I mean , let &apos;s turn out the joy , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you &apos;ll ask the best speech of all . &quot; &quot; And you know ? F@@ ounding , the best narrative of all , the people who are going to go and then make the best speech of all .
So so much that changed .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no reason why we don &apos;t have any time until it .
There &apos;s what happens until you .
There &apos;s to do it long enough to turn out and inter@@ ference .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
We can take the change of the change .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
Before I face this next day where I am in two minutes , try to take this , in the case , in the room , in the bedroom , in the room , on the head of the day , on the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of the day , the head of
This is what you have to do .
So to make the brain for the best of that .
It &apos;s testosterone . It &apos;s going to cut the cu@@ is@@ l .
You wouldn &apos;t be that a situation where I didn &apos;t have a little girl who I showed you who are .
I mean , I &apos;m like that this situation with the sense that I &apos;m going to say , who are and vo@@ ids .
I want to ask you before anything you have a power in , and I also want to invite you to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m interested in it , showing people , and that &apos;s why the best one can use it , and the ones that better can use it , and that &apos;s not the power .
I &apos;m interested in them because they can do it in private .
They just need their own body , privacy and two minutes to make a better business mark of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So what I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The F@@ as@@ ly@@ es@@ ly@@ sm &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s a good option .
( Laughter ) But what I &apos;m going to talk about is what &apos;s the big problem in the world ?
And I mean , before we continue to keep going , we &apos;ll ask you , we have our little little keys to you you can get to see me like we do it to help me see how we do it .
So we take laser lamps and paper .
So finally , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world that &apos;s there .
I &apos;m going to list some of you .
800 million people are hunger .
millions of people don &apos;t have access to the same .
Tw@@ e@@ <unk> .
Most people are dying of HIV and AIDS .
The contin@@ gency of the .
Tw@@ o-@@ billion people who are going to be compelling by changing climate change — and we &apos;re going to .
We have many , many problems out there .
In a ideal world , we would fix all , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that not all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question that I think we should do is — and that &apos;s why we are at the age of economy — is saying , if we don &apos;t do it all , we really need to think about asking , why should we do we should solve the first ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had 50 billion dollars to spend in the next four years to get the world , what we should do is ?
We have 10 of the most big ones in the world &apos;s ro@@ mp@@ ting , and just quantum mechanics , but we can &apos;t , but we can , to make sure , to make sure , to the poor , to the financial stability , and corrupt , and the infrastructure and the boundaries to commerce .
We think these , in many ways , a lot of ways , a lot of good , very much , very much better .
So what I would get asked , what do you think are we wonder , what are the greatest ?
Why should we start solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s wondering about a mer@@ maid problem in the world , but that &apos;s wondering about a mer@@ maid problem .
It was actually the punchline in the case of what you talked about in the Solomon Islands .
But I think it &apos;s great , there &apos;s a problem if you ask people that are focused on the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
We continue the biggest problem of problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the thing is not just how to solve the problems , but by pre@@ pressing the solutions to the problems .
And she said — naturally , it makes a little more complicated .
To change climate change , it would be something like K@@ ey@@ h .
To either br@@ i@@ d , they could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
To the conflict , the U.S. forces of the U.N. , and so we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to ask you to try to try to do , and that in 30 seconds — and I know it kind of a way to do something impossible — you know what you think are the magical thing of the Internet .
And it &apos;s also — in the case , of course , where the economy will be done — angel , whatever we should do .
What should we be at the end of the list ?
Please , take a couple of seconds , maybe talk to the people , and they just know what should be the primary priorities and the least primary for the solutions that we have for the world &apos;s greatest problems .
The surprising of this process — of course , I mean , would I love , I would love , I would love , just 18 minutes of telling you a major amount of time , right ?
I &apos;d like to make it to you , and I want to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
And I &apos;m also highly recommend , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;re also going to have these argument , and then to think , how we prioritize really ?
So , then there &apos;s a question , why did you have done a list , why never has done a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the primary ingredient is incredible .
Nobody wants to do it .
Of course , all the ones wanted to be in the tall@@ est of a list like that .
But also all the original acts . They would not be in the tall@@ est .
And there &apos;s a lot more , but there &apos;s a lot more , but it &apos;s logical , you don &apos;t want a list like this .
60 years ago there &apos;s the U.N. , and it &apos;s not going to have done it , and it &apos;s not going to be done a basic list of great things we can do in the world , and said , &quot; &quot; How would we do we would do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t have the tails — every decision is a prioritize , so that we all are all the ones that are just under the — and that &apos;s not likely that good as the fact that it &apos;s true for granted , and we &apos;ve talked and we &apos;re not sure it &apos;s so good for us to know that .
So what I &apos;m proposing is really true we had , for a long time , a situation in which they found a lot of time , a situation in which they have multiple choices .
There are many , many things we can do , and we didn &apos;t have the Neanderthals , and the hell are the ones .
We had no idea .
Imagine you run into a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the hell are .
You know you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a dol@@ p@@ ar , they could be 1,000 dollars .
Could be a familiar pizza . Could you be a individual pizza , right ?
You want to know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s trying to do the job of doing the Con@@ pr@@ ose of Sh@@ ack@@ -@@ je@@ wels — it &apos;s about to put the Neanderthals of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of the sense of the Hell S@@ av@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha@@ no@@ vices .
We &apos;ve forgotten 30 from the best economists in the world , three of every area .
So we had to let three of the greatest economists on the planet writing about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be its cost ? What do we do ? What do we do ? What &apos;s the vote ? What we do ? What is the vote ? What &apos;s the vote ? What &apos;s going on ? What do we do ? What &apos;s the hell ? What do you do ? What &apos;s going ? What &apos;s the hell ? What do you mean ? What &apos;s the hell ? What do you mean ? What &apos;s the hell ? What do you mean ? What &apos;s the hell ?
Same with un@@ de@@ ax@@ i@@ lored diseases .
Three of the best experts saying , we can do it ?
What is the price ?
What should we do about that , and what would be the outcome ?
And so on .
So we took some of the greatest economists , eight of the greatest economists , eight of the greatest economists , and they were all three of the greatest citizens in the world .
We call the &quot; &quot; Take &quot; &quot; button , &quot; &quot; — the pre@@ limin@@ ation of the E@@ us@@ al &apos;s license decided to call them the Real Real Real economy .
E@@ rimin@@ al work works in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did , it was actually a golden list .
And then asked you , why ?
And so , of course , I &apos;m very sure that we were asking that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The theme is , obviously , if you want to know , questions for the malaria .
If you want to know about the weather , questions about a brief clip .
But if you want to know what the two of you are going to solve , you can &apos;t ask any of the two of the two , because that &apos;s what you do .
That &apos;s what they do the economists .
E@@ hu@@ dge .
They &apos;re going to be dis@@ respectful to something un@@ nice , and we have to do it first , and we have to do it .
So this is the list , and this is the list that we want to share with you .
Of course you can see the way you can see on the web , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also talk about it as the day the day .
So this is a list of a list that said that there were bad projects — basically , projects where you &apos;re going to be a dol@@ ar , and you get less of a dol@@ or as a result .
They were right , and then they were right , and then the good thing is .
And of course , they are the very good projects we should start to start by doing .
So I &apos;m going to start from the last so much we can start to close the best projects .
These were the poop .
As you can see at the end of the list is the climate change .
This off@@ is the many people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people will tell you that he should not go to .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why did this ?
And the truth is I &apos;ll also try to talk about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we don &apos;t let you agree with the lists you would have .
The reason that worked out that said , K@@ ey@@ h — or do something else that K@@ ey@@ -@@ is — it &apos;s not just good for it because it &apos;s extremely inefficient .
It &apos;s not saying that there &apos;s no global global dent .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do is that we can do it so little , a very high cost .
What we basically showed you , the media is the whole thing in all of the macro models , and that K@@ ey@@ h , if the whole world is , would increase the increase of 1@@ 3,000 dollars a year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
It was three times the global aid leader that we put in the Third World every year .
And to do very little .
All models show that when you go to the heated one six years to 2@@ 100 .
So one type in Bangladesh that is actually a way in 2@@ 100 can take up to 2@@ 6 .
What &apos;s something good , but not very well .
So the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something good .
And just by giving a referendum , the U.N. estimates that the average half of the average , a couple billion dollars a year , we could solve all the main problems in the world .
We could give water water , sanitation , internal , education , education all the human beings on the planet .
So we should ask , we &apos;d ask , we want to spend twice as well ?
Or half a good thing ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out
It &apos;s not saying that if you had to let the money in the world , you won &apos;t want to do it .
It &apos;s also , when we don &apos;t have it , it &apos;s just not our first priority .
The right projects — I &apos;m not just comment on all — but non@@ gen@@ i@@ ca@@ i@@ ic diseases scale , the ones are just by just because , the scale of health services of health care is a big thing .
It would make a lot of good , but it also and a lot of them , but that very coastal .
Again , what you see and suddenly we started thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the creative projects , it &apos;s going to have a lot of sanitation projects .
Again , sanitation and water is incredible , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four wonderful great priorities of that , that should be , when the first one is we &apos;re going to solve the problems in the world .
The largest number of space-time is malaria — treat malaria .
The incidence of malaria is about one billion infected individuals .
It could even increase an entire point of GDP to the year of GDP to the clinic .
If we invested a billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce the burden of half .
We could avoid death to death other people , but perhaps it &apos;s most important , we could prevent one billion people if infected each year .
We would apply to his ability to address many of the other problems that they have to deal with . We would apply to the long-term global global warming that they have to deal with .
The third one is the contrast by commerce .
So the model has shown that if we could make our insurance , and especially cutting the aid of the earth and Europe , we could basically rise the global economy with the amazing thing about two to four percent of the year , half of the year , half of which I would actually make the third of the World Bank .
Again , we could actually take 200 or 300 million people of the global poverty , radically radically different and very fast , between two or five .
That would be the third one thing we could do .
The second one thing would be turned to the dis@@ main@@ -@@ nouri@@ shment .
It doesn &apos;t really dis@@ nouri@@ sh in general , sen@@ sion a very econom@@ ical path of treating malnutrition , is saying , the lack of micro .
It turns out that half the world &apos;s population has resi@@ sted and z@@ ir@@ c , and the half of the world has been over and over , and the world is the and vitamin D .
If we split 12 billion dollars , we could make a profound in@@ cur@@ sion of this problem .
This would be the second one better gift we could do .
And the best project would be turned into HIV / AIDS .
It turns out , if we &apos;ve created 1@@ 500 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this makes you , what is , what is it , what is we have two different ways of treating HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is the decline .
Again , in a ideal world , the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it , we should , when we were going to be investing , we should , when we should be investing first .
And the treatment is a lot more , much more expensive than prevent prevent .
So we &apos;re getting a li@@ ch@@ et , where this is why we can do much more investing in the decline of decline .
It &apos;s about money for money that we spend in , and we can do X for treating cancer , and 10 times more of us .
So again , we have to be focusing on more than in more than treatment , as the first one .
What this does is really really only allow us to think about our priorities .
I would like to think you would like to think about your brand list and say , well , you &apos;ll be able to do it well ?
Have you ever seen something like that , or would you have to get something like that , so you would have to come here ?
Well , think German , one of the things is again the change , the climate change , the climate change , is again changing .
So a lot of people think it &apos;s very , very little , but that very little bit convinced that it &apos;s .
We should also make climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But , of course , no one does not all host the entire box but .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if we focus on problems , we will always be focusing on the right thing .
In those we can do a lot more well than a little bit .
And I think , the truth — Thomas Sch@@ r@@ ling , one of the subjects of the &quot; &quot; Take &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; he explained , very well .
One of the things that people live , and in a hundred years when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of climate change , people will be much , much more richer .
The most won@@ d-@@ resistant impacts of the U.N. is the fact that the most won@@ d-@@ resistant impacts of the U.N. is the num@@ -@@ ity-@@ ity-@@ ity-@@ cent@@ ers of the U.N. .
It &apos;s estimated that a person in the developing world in 2@@ 100 will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , two times the richest time we are in the place .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even more rich than that .
But the thing is , when we talk about saving people , the help people in Bangladesh in Bangladesh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor B@@ ose .
We &apos;re talking about a very rich ex@@ cre@@ ves .
And so the real subject , of course , is , we want to spend a lot of money a little bit , about 100 years ago , a holy world ?
We want to help people , and we want to help people , and we want to help people , and who are really really the ones who are really excited about , and who can help the very addicted to it ?
Or how did it Sch@@ et me , imagine that rich divide — how will it be — a rich en@@ rich@@ ment , a li@@ ch@@ ate divide , a giant ph@@ an@@ a@@ mi@@ fied in 2@@ 100 of the rich in 2@@ 100 of the rich in the 2005 and saying , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s really about it so much to help me and my great-@@ grandmother , who could have been taught to help a lot more ? &quot; &quot; So I think what really changed us is why we need to put our
If you don &apos;t look at this problem , you &apos;re not just a typical way to see this problem .
So , of course , it &apos;s fundamentally because the climate change has some good photos .
You know , we have &quot; &quot; El day &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; El day &quot; &quot; — it seems great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I want candle , right , but I don &apos;t think that &apos;s why I don &apos;t think that poli@@ o@@ ous the oc@@ cluded pup@@ pi@@ ed the P@@ Eric P@@ ot next to the next two days or something like this . ( Laughter )
So in many ways , I think the Con@@ su@@ mption of Sh@@ <unk> <unk> e is the whole debate about the priorities of the priorities of the fetus &apos;s being a dra@@ ft of problems .
To make sure that &apos;s not just to make it good , it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it good , so it &apos;s not just to make it
It &apos;s not going to do things that have the greatest med@@ al , but it &apos;s also going to be about making places where we actually can do a better well .
The other obj@@ ection , I think , is that I &apos;m interested in some of it , or we &apos;re — we &apos;re giving a fake choice .
We have to do it all , in a ideal world — it would be totally broken .
I think we should do all of things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In the 1970s , the world developed decided we were going to spend twice as we did , right now , even in the 1970s in the 1970s .
Like our help were divided into half .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be that we are in the way to solve all the big problems .
So , similarly , people would also say , but there &apos;s the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion d@@ al@@ ly@@ sm , so we don &apos;t spend it in the world .
I &apos;m hooked .
If you can talk to the Bush so that makes it well , it &apos;s okay .
But of course , it &apos;s not just it , it &apos;s saying , if you had another 100 billion dollars , it &apos;s still wanting to be used as much as possible , right ?
So the real problem , it &apos;s starting to start again and think what the priorities are the right .
So I should mention briefly , is this really the right list ?
You know , when you ask the best economists in the world , the inevitable predic@@ tor is just by asking you to the white men and old of the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a way to look at the entire world .
So we &apos;re getting 80 young people around the world so that we solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and that was the first requirements .
Most of them were , first , in the developing world .
They had the same material , but they could move away from that way , but they could move away from the subject of the discussion , how they really did , to establish their own lists .
And the surprising one was that the list was very similarly — with malnutrition and disease in the highest and changing climate change .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There &apos;s a lot of other <unk> als and students and students and different things .
They all had as a result of the same list .
And that me really , really , to say I think there &apos;s a way to think that I think there &apos;s a way to think about our priorities , and say , what is the most important of the world ?
We would have a little bit of an ideal world , and we would love it all .
But if we don &apos;t do it all , we can start thinking about where we would start ?
I see the Con@@ pr@@ in@@ tes Con@@ pr@@ ose of Sh@@ abi@@ a as a process .
So we did in 2004 , and we hope to go back to the more people , to get a lot better data in 2008 , 2012 .
We had to make the way right for the world , but also begin to think about political disability .
To think about saying , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell the things you can &apos;t do with it , but the things we don &apos;t know how to do it , but what we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we have to be honest with the argument of how we can really know how to do it , but we have to be honest with the argument of how we can really know , but we have to be honest with the argument , if there
If we were in some things that we &apos;re going to do , we &apos;re going to do not worry about others .
So I hope that we are going to help us to help the traditional priorities , and think how we work better for the world .

A few years ago , I stood outside the house with no keys .
He was going to get home to the house to a friend to another side of the city because the temperature has to turn the two scales .
And I was in the translator , and I was the joy that I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , he could see them by the way the table &apos;s the dining table , where it had had .
But they were all closed .
I couldn &apos;t tell it that night in my friend &apos;s house , because early morning I was going to have a flight to Europe and she would need to take the sports and the suitcase .
So desperate and die from the cold College of the entire cartoon and then I &apos;ll turn it into the lip@@ se to the cover of the sidewalk .
I was going to make a lot of money , but I don &apos;t even more than a suitcase in the middle of the night .
Well , it &apos;s called the neuro@@ science of science , and it &apos;s going to change the science science , and it &apos;s going to change the science of science , and it &apos;s going to change the science science , and it &apos;s going to change the science science , and it &apos;s going to change the science science , and it &apos;s going to change the science science , and it &apos;s going to change the science science , and it &apos;s going to change the science science , and it &apos;s going to change the

And until I got to the officer of the airport , I didn &apos;t realize that I knew I knew I was missing .
So I came back to the house , with the snow and the ice , in 40-@@ a straight - in 40-@@ a sports loc@@ gue , I came back to the airport , but I had my seat to another person , but I had my seat to another person , but I had my seat to another person , but I had my seat to another person , but I had my seat to another person , but I had my seat to another person , but I had my seat to another person , but I

It was something that &apos;s made of the American psychologist in the world , and it &apos;s also going to die of it .
So , does a team of experts , a team of experts , that we would have to be able to identify what happened , right ?
Because it comes to death , and then we try to determine what you can do .
So what I want to talk about today is what we can do today .
Some things are evident , and some are not so much .
I &apos;ll start by the time .
We can move places everywhere for the whole things that are going to be lost .
Well , this sounds like common sense , and it &apos;s like this is the way common , and it &apos;s like this is the way common sense , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s so much common , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s so much common , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s so much common , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s so much common , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s so much common , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s so much common , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s so much common ,
There &apos;s a structure of the brain called the hippocampus , which has evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to think the attitudes of important things , and where it &apos;s the poet , where you can catch the very small , and enemy .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain &apos;s brain brain .
In fact , there &apos;s been somebody who did the experiment of the sense of smell , the sense of the fact that the fact that the fact that the rest of the s@@ ol@@ lies are , in fact , there &apos;s been a sense of smell .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t move too much , and not with things that move too much .
So there &apos;s a place where the air is somewhere for your keys .
To the sports man , a specific pilot . The head of reading , in a particular position .
If you first came to a place and if it &apos;s sno@@ wed , it &apos;s going to be in your place when you look at it .
And when we travel ? It stays a picture with the cell phone with the cell , and when we traveled it ?
He ate an email with a photo to be a so@@ ila .
These are seem obvious things like teeth .
You remember when we &apos;re under stress , the brain emits un@@ cut .
The cutting is stripped apart and the mind .
It &apos;s actually to recognize that the responses still will not be able to make the best of you , and that we should have otherwise , as a system .
I remember that when I faced a medical decision that when I faced a medical decision .
We &apos;re all going to be somewhere in a situation situation in a situation of a situation .
And I want to talk about it .
or any decision that we can do , or any decision that we can do to do any of the things that make us do or any decision that will do to do something about it or any decision that we can do , or any decision that we can do to do something about it or any decision that we can do , or any decision that we can do to do something about it or any decision that we can do , or any decision that we can do to do something about it or any decision
We then put it in the doctor , and this says &quot; &quot; I have the results of the test and have the cholesterol a little . &quot;
You know what the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is you know that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is you know that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is you know that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is you know that high cholesterol cholesterol . You know what the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is you know that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is that the cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol you know is
And we think it &apos;s just thinking that have the high cholesterol &apos;s right cholesterol , and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to make a drug that &apos;s likely to know how to handle them . &quot;
You should ask a statistic statistics of statistics should be you should ask for a statistic statistics ?
It &apos;s the number of innovation . &quot; &quot; No . That &apos;s N@@ NT ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have a drug that &apos;s going to take it before you help a person .
And you think what the statistics of statistics is that ?
The number one should be . My doctor didn &apos;t know me , not just to do something that &apos;s not help .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
But not the way that we are not quite well .
G@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ S@@ K@@ E estimates estimates that 90 percent of the medicines are actually about 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So the N@@ NT is the most prescri@@ -@@ -@@ prescri@@ -@@ by-@@ care rate where you think it &apos;s ?
How many people do you have your suitcase before you help someone &apos;s helping someone ?
This second results results results results , and this second results results results results .
I was really hooked on data .
And we think we &apos;ve been thinking of a generic reality and we think we &apos;ve been thinking of a traditional understanding of what we think we think we have been thinking of a world and think of a global network and we think we &apos;ve been thinking of a way we think we have been a way to think of a global network and other digital world , and we think we &apos;ve been thinking of a way we think we &apos;ve been thinking of a way we think about it , and we think we &apos;ve been
In the case of this drug drug medicine , the drug case of this drug drug drug drug wants the drug in the case of this drug drug drug . &quot; &quot; In the case of this drug drug medication , the drug case of this drug drug drug drug wants the case in the case of this drug drug drug drug &#93; In the case of this drug drug drug drug , in the case of this drug drug drug drug , in the case of this drug drug drug drug , in the case of this drug

So just that should you , if you would have this conversation with your doctor .
You &apos;re right to have access to this information to be able to talk to you about the data to talk to you about to talk about how to talk to you about the power of the data to talk to you about to talk about the data .
I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact , the N@@ NT , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact the N@@ NT , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact the N@@ NT , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact the N@@ NT , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact the N@@ NT , I think I &apos;m talking about this number
The prostate prostate cancer is by cancer , N@@ ec@@ i@@ prostate prostate prostate prostate cancer , N@@ Y@@ P &apos;s 49 .
Yes , there &apos;s to do 49 diseases by every person who &apos;s helping .
And the side effects in this case in the case of 50 percent of patients .
In@@ sec@@ ts behave , it &apos;s physically subtle function , in@@ contin@@ gency .
So the idea of the death has been to make the conversation .
The ideal thing is not having to create all this at the time .
And also there &apos;s to think about subjects like quality quality .
I &apos;m things we have to think now and talk now and talk to the family and loved ones .
You remember : under stress the brain emits un@@ cut and one of the things that happens in that moment is that if they go a lot of systems .
Ev@@ olution tells us that explanation .
Because if your body has been mis@@ ses in these things , and we don &apos;t just speed very rapidly , and we don &apos;t just speed very rapidly quickly , because if your body has been mis@@ ses in these things and we don &apos;t let it fast fast , and we don &apos;t let it fast fast for quickly , because if your body has been mis@@ ses in these things and we don &apos;t let it fast fast for quickly , and we don &apos;t just speed very rapidly fast fast .
I mean , one of the things that you look like as a man like K@@ h@@ í@@ man and his colleagues .
So we need training to think anti@@ angiogenic in this kind of thing .
I think the most important thing is recognize that we all have deficit disorder .
We &apos;re going wrong .
So the idea is to think anti@@ angiogenic therapy in which they can be wrong , so the systems that can damage damage or just avoiding that these things like these things hurt without any .
I &apos;ll come back to that night with the head of the house in the front of the house , and when I came back to stage the key to the house in the house and a easy code to remember .

Or if a child comes to me and said , &quot; &quot; Don , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to feel the people on the street , saying , &quot; &quot; JL : English &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; I mean &quot; &quot; D@@ id@@ ing English &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I was going to tell you that the people were by saying , &quot; &quot; JL : English &quot; &quot; ?
How did they feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better than stop and talk about it .
What I mean is that those express that are actually the tragic thing in the way that we are actually .
I have a friend who &apos;s talking to you , I have a friend who &apos;s walking around with a chicken .
I once asked him all .
And he said , &quot; &quot; All right , but once I spent my night , why night ? &quot;
We &apos;re getting it wrong , so it &apos;s not that they don &apos;t know about their husband , and it &apos;s normal he doesn &apos;t understand it ; it &apos;s different .
She said , &quot; &quot; He wants to say &quot; &quot; El ck me , &quot; &quot; and one night , I tried to translate it to me so that I feel when I &apos;m going to make it feel what I feel when I &apos;m not happy . &quot; &quot; The guy tried or translated it into this : &quot; ... I hold my hands and stole your hands ... &quot; ( Laughter ) And here comes the mantra : ( Laughter ) And here comes the mantra : ( Laughter ) And here comes the mantra :

And when somebody &apos;s talking about it , I hate the Arabic .
We use ... ( Applause ) We mean we want to change our reality , and it &apos;s convinced that we want to change our reality , aspirations and day day .
It &apos;s like we and how we think about how we think .
After that we were going to run photos of young people and they are dressed with Arab characters .
They were from young people and bread .
We are very ec@@ ec@@ ec@@ ol .
And whatever says , &quot; &quot; E@@ h , use a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopted the word &quot; &quot; co@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ l &quot; &quot; which &quot; &quot; I mean , &quot; &quot; I mean , I adopted a more beautiful word , and it &apos;s better with reality .

or the reason they think they have to have a authority about us , or the reason they think they have to have a authority about us , or the reason they think they have authority about us , what they think they have to be , what should it be to the language , what it means to be the language , where it &apos;s operating .
The creativity in language is the way .
So let &apos;s start with all right right now .
One sounds could actually do the other global global .
I could take the Arabic again again .
But we have to know it , and be convinced that there &apos;s a solution , and we have to be convinced that there &apos;s a solution that exists , and that we have the chance to form it .
So , what can we do for all of you since now ?
See — you &apos;re going to see — who is , who is , who is , who is ?
Please , would be , would you , even my time had been broken , and then my time had been broken , and then my time had been finished , and she would put it , and then my time had been sudden , she was finished , and she would put me , and she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished , she was finished
But they don &apos;t write in Arabic with characters with numbers .
( Applause ) So it &apos;s a dis@@ done . It &apos;s not a language !
They would be able to be a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back to the world and to cover .
Now , the secret now .
Kids are first identified to their father &apos;s father &apos;s father , and babies who identified their first father to their father &apos;s father &apos;s mother who are first identified their father first to their father &apos;s father .
So when I was born my daughter , I refuse to say , &quot; &quot; This is a voice , my heritage , my heritage . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; Th@@ is it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; Th@@ is it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; T@@ ma is a key , hon@@ um . &quot;
What is the hell in the mind from baby ?
If we asked this about 30 years , most people , psychologists , psychologists , would say this baby is mer@@ maid , hangs , epi@@ th@@ rich , Asian — who didn &apos;t have to account someone else &apos;s perspective or not even understand a process of caus@@ al .
Over the last 20 years , science science has been the development of development or fully this theory .
In a sense , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of the most conscious .
You &apos;re just an example of this .
One thing that could be thinking about this baby , that could be happening in his mind , is to address what &apos;s happening in the mind of another baby .
And finally , one of the most sali@@ ent things for us is to be treating the other people &apos;s own people , they think it &apos;s about the fact that other people think about and .
And maybe the hardest thing to understand that what others think about and it is not the same as what we think and we feel .
Anyone who &apos;s so much of the policy can say the hard it works , and it &apos;s actually really hard to do it .
We know if babies and kids and kids could understand this very complex idea about other people .
So , how do we ask you ?
Kids don &apos;t talk , and if we ask a three-year-old child who tells us , we just want to make a thoughts of thoughts about whether or not we &apos;re going to be able to make a sustainable body of thoughts ?
How do we ask you ?
It turns out the secret was the rabbi .
Be@@ ty Ra@@ ch@@ i , one of my students , and most of me , we gave babies to the babies of the two to the food : one with the same hor@@ rors and another pr@@ erec@@ orded of a mar@@ tial .
All babies , even in Berkeley , like the chickens , and you don &apos;t like the li@@ ca .
( Laughter ) Next , what did I do that was the same amount of food .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I loved it , or not what I would test .
Half the time , he loved him like the chickens and the rabbi — like a normal person or normal person .
But the other half , took a little bit of li@@ me and said , &quot; &quot; M@@ e@@ e@@ me , Allah .
I &apos;ve been able to the rabbi . M@@ e@@ e@@ k . &quot; &quot; And then she was a little bit of k@@ op@@ k@@ or , and he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ mos , you can &apos;t read it .
I &apos;ve been able to get the chickens . A@@ mos , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s like the opposite of what the hell I loved to babies .
This is the most amazing thing to do this with 15 and 18 months .
So Be@@ ty l@@ ords was the man , and he said , &quot; &quot; Get me a little bit ! &quot;
So the thing was , if you were asked babies what would like them to do it or get it ?
The surprising one was that babies of 18 months , who ended up beginning to walk and talk , and I &apos;d never like him to get them to the chickens , and the rabbi would like him , and the rabbi would like the rabbi .
On the other hand , babies &apos;s babies &apos; ages 15 months to get it , and it seemed like he loved the O@@ p@@ i , like if we don &apos;t get it .
And then I watched it for a long mouse , and then he &apos;s a long way , what he thought would love all the world .
So there are two data revealed this .
For one thing is that babies &apos;s babies &apos; babies have been able to discover this important insight of human nature : that we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understand that they have to work to help other people who are able to do what they &apos;re going to be .
And more interesting , no , that babies &apos;s babies who are 15 months old don &apos;t do this ; what the kids kids of 18 months don &apos;t do this ; what is the ones that 18 months learned from the death of the age of 15 months .
So babies know the more and they learn more than we &apos;ve been thinking about .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that have done in the last 20 years to discover this thing .
What if you can ask now is why kids are willing so much ?
And how is it possible that they learn so much in a little while ?
It &apos;s saying , the first view , babies seem pretty useless .
And in many instances , they are worse than useful , because we have to make a lot of time and energy just in keeping them alive .
If we re@@ su@@ mption evolution to get the feedback to this mystery , that we lost so much time babies are useless useless , and it turns out that there &apos;s an answer that we lost so much time for babies , and if we re@@ re@@ learn to get this particular insight of why we lost babies , that they are a response to why we lost babies , and if we re@@ re@@ learn the answer to this particular mystery of why we &apos;ve lost so much time in babies , it turns out that there
If you look different species , not just other species , not just other prime cases like us , but also other cele@@ bra@@ ties like blue@@ fin ph@@ s or flying the vo@@ ids , result there &apos;s relationship between the committee of childhood , and the size of the brain and the flexibility and the flexibility and the intelligence and the flexibility .
One example of this tou@@ ch-@@ we &apos;ve made this one of these nan@@ ologists you can see here .
For a band , we have the New Cal@@ ed@@ ony .
The cor@@ l@@ ings and other cor@@ ch@@ ages , ch@@ opped , the pu@@ ff@@ -@@ , are really smart .
And in the right senses are really smart as the chimpanzees are .
And this is a very long , very long , that has learned using tools to get food .
On the other hand , we have our mother ja@@ ges .
The g@@ apping , so as the ducks , it &apos;s like the ducks , and it &apos;s just par@@ rots , it &apos;s just like stones .
I &apos;m very good , but it &apos;s not really good enough , but it &apos;s not really good at doing anything else .
It turns out that babies from New Cal@@ ed@@ ony , the pi@@ ch@@ ers of New Cal@@ ed@@ ony , the pi@@ ch@@ ers of New Cal@@ ed@@ ony , the pi@@ ch@@ ers of New Cal@@ ed@@ ony , the pi@@ er@@ ers of New Cal@@ ed@@ ony , the pi@@ sts of the one , the pi@@ er@@ ts , the sp@@ ar@@ ar@@ ma , the sp@@ ar@@ ma , the sp@@ ines of New Cal@@ ed@@ ar@@ ar@@ ya , the pi@@ er@@ ts the one , the sp@@ ar@@ hy , the sp@@
They rely on their mom@@ ent@@ ers put their worms in the mouth to the two years of life , which in a very long life in the very long life of a birds .
But the g@@ apper , the g@@ apper , is just a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why the people are being in the bed of the gates of scientific journals that the g@@ ators are so on the weekends and the soup .
There &apos;s something in the early ten@@ ets that seem to be related to knowledge and learning .
What does we have to have to do this ?
Some animals , like chickens , seem cre@@ sting to do something very well .
So the g@@ apping is very good by putting a lot of a big , big environment .
Others , like the cor@@ din@@ en , are not particularly good at all , but they are very good to learn different patterns of different environments .
And of course , we are , we are the beings , we are far in that distributed .
We have brains that are much larger than our bodies , much more than any other animal .
I smarter smart , more knowled@@ ge-@@ educated , and we can learn more , many more environments : we have migrate around the planet and even face space .
And our babies and children depended on us for a lot more time than babies were other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So until the third , we still have the ones in the rich to see their own open .
Okay , so why do we look at this relationship ?
One idea is that this strategy was , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way to enter in this world . But it &apos;s a great dis@@ be@@ ge of a world .
It turns out that until everybody learns it , if it &apos;s in@@ equity .
Wouldn &apos;t it be good for us to get us to a mat@@ t-@@ asking , and be thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a ji@@ g or a guy ? What is it ? &quot;
I would be better knowing all of that before that sp@@ urs the ma@@ fi@@ e .
And the way that quantum mechanics is that this problem was , it seems like a piece of work .
So we have this kind of time in which we are totally protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . It &apos;s just to learn .
And then , as adults , we can take that we learn from babies and children and the practice of practice for the world .
One way to think about this is that babies and kids are the ones that are the F@@ ew and under@@ under@@ be the department of human species .
I &apos;m the people who are protected , and they only have to go out , learn and have good ideas , and we are the production and commerci@@ alization .
We have to take all of these ideas and we &apos;ve learned from children and then put them in practice .
Another way of thinking is , instead of thinking of babies and kids like adults like in@@ fore@@ head , thinking about these as being a kind of different development in the same species , like the random ones and the brake , but the Neanderthals , the ra@@ ges that the morph@@ ation of the garden exploring , and we would be able to close them out in our narrow way of adults .
If this is true , if babies are actually the way to learn , and this story of evolution in the show that this is , that the kids are to learn , and we hope for a lot of powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the brain of a baby looks like the computer &apos;s computer is to be the most powerful learning of the planet .
But the real computers are improving hard .
There &apos;s quantum mechanics there &apos;s been a way to understand the machine machine machine learning .
And all of this is the cause of the ideas of this man , the rever@@ ing Thomas B@@ y@@ ons , a statistical statistical audience of the 18th century .
So the In@@ ge@@ tically , B@@ y@@ ically , has provided a mathematical modeling that made theory of the probability of probability and the way scientists found that the scientists found things in the world .
What scientists do is to plant a hypothesis , something that we could start to start .
So then we would be able to test that test test .
The test test to make change the hypothesis , and the test test becomes changed .
They &apos;re going to make new evidence that they &apos;re going to be able to measure new evidence , and so it &apos;s got to be able to do it .
What B@@ y@@ es showed was a mathematical attribute that could do that .
And math is the basis of the best programs of learning that we have today .
Ten years ago , I was suggesting that babies were supposed to be doing the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s happening under these hydro@@ n@@ ves , I think it &apos;s something very much like this very much like this kind of thing like this , and if we want to know what &apos;s happening under these hydro@@ n@@ ves , I think it &apos;s something very much like this .
At the first time in the T@@ ap@@ R , the pup@@ se@@ se@@ se@@ se@@ es on the top found on the page , the B@@ ay@@ ar &apos;s on the H@@ ay@@ es .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculations with disabilities who &apos;ve been asked , and that we figure out how the world works .
Well , this is even more difficult than ever to do .
If you &apos;re an adult about an adult about statistics , it makes it quite a lot .
How is it possible that kids do statistics ?
To test this , we use a machine we gave to call the Sh@@ en@@ et of B@@ et .
It &apos;s a box that goes out and sounds when they have been struck by it a few years .
By using this machine as simple , in my lab , and also other people , if they were asked by studies of studies about the creative ones that are learning about the world .
I &apos;ve shown just one we &apos;ve done with Jaws Spi@@ ner , one of my students .
If you show you this detector probably you would start to think that the way that we put it in a way is to put a block of a detector .
But the case is that the detector works in a way that &apos;s so much bizarre .
If you just like a block of the detector , something in which you don &apos;t think of a beginning , the det@@ ar@@ ant , the particular animal , the detector &apos;s active for every three times .
It turns out that if we put the block out there , what would we be like , is it just if you &apos;re just two times every six times .
So the odds that less likely has more compli@@ cations .
It looks like the strategy going to shake the object &apos;s more expan@@ ant , and it looks more painful than another .
So we explained this data to the four four years and we gave them the way that we tried .
And with security , the kids of four years used to be used the data and fl@@ ed the object on top of the detector .
There are two data here in this .
The first , nurses , who are four years old , and the first , I remember that I was four years old , and I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a seven-year-old girl , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a woman , I &apos;m a
who are learning to tell me , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell , who are learning to tell , who are learning to tell , who are learning to tell , who are learning to tell , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell them , who are learning to tell them
But it consciously seems that it &apos;s actually making complex calculations who are given a measure of un@@ condi@@ tional prob@@ es .
The second point is that they are using the evidence to get a sense , a hypothesis that it &apos;s something like a hypothesis , which seems pretty unlikely to the beginning .
So in studies that we take in the lab , other similar challenges , we &apos;ve shown that these four years of are the best finding that the same little years ago , the same task .
So the kids , kids are doing statistics to get statistics about the world , but scientists experience them , after all , and see if kids were experiencing themselves too .
It &apos;s what we usually call &quot; &quot; par@@ se &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s many interesting studies interesting studies that show that these games are like a kind of research program .
We show a World Wi@@ rat lab .
I put it using a new coach called B@@ ap@@ et .
It showed the kids that the Neanderthals were going to work and the red triangles don &apos;t , and the red triangles will be a .
What we &apos;ll see now is this boy by writing five minutes of time .
N@@ ight : So what ?
N@@ ight : Just like the other side .
Alli@@ son : Well , the first chance to do it .
N@@ ight : Nothing . ( Laughter ) Mos@@ king : This is the thing , but this is not .
Alli@@ son : It starts to fulfilling the same experiment .
N@@ ight : Why do you take care ?
( Laughter ) Mos@@ king : I don &apos;t understand it .
Alli@@ son : Scientists are likely to recognize that desperate face of desperate .
( Laughter ) Mos@@ king : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be , and this has to be .
Alli@@ son : L@@ i@@ stic , hypothesis two .
N@@ ours : So it &apos;s going to be .
N@@ o : Oh ... you can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) Alli@@ son : Now it comes from this idea .
He asked the researcher who tried to pass on top of the other .
N@@ un@@ did it worked .
N@@ ight : Oh , it &apos;s because light is only going to get there , right here .
You put this box there , you have electricity , but this doesn &apos;t have .
Alli@@ son : Well , that would be the fourth fourth hypothesis .
N@@ o : Now yeah !
If you experiment four blocks .
If you test four blocks together , you go to the two to the bottom and you have the other .
Alli@@ son : Well , that &apos;s the farm .
This child is — it &apos;s a very small child , and a lot of research , but C@@ ick@@ oline found that it &apos;s a very typical child .
If you look like the kids , if you ask you to wonder , what do you do is to try and say , what do they do is to try .
Very typical kids &apos; kids &apos; own .
Well , what do you feel like this kind of creature ?
What if you feel like one of these s@@ wers that can test five minutes in two minutes ?
If we represent psychologists theory and philosophers , many of them are just conscious , or even not the ones are all conscious , or even not .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and kids are more conscious to adults .
This is what we know about how to work in adulthood .
Re@@ awareness and attention of an adult human being a focus .
What happens in the adult is that when we decide something is important or relevant , we aim attention .
The awareness of it is what we are aiming for to us , and the joy that the rest of the are , the ones that are the rest of the sound .
We also know how this is going to be in the brain .
When we pay attention to something , the brain is the part of the brain , the part that we aim for is a signal that makes a little part of the brain if it &apos;s clean , it &apos;s a little bit more about it , better to learn ; and the activity in the rest of the brain .
We have so much of a very plausible attention , guided by the way .
If you look at babies and kids , we see something very different .
I think babies and kids seem to have a much more like a mer@@ en@@ -like awareness of an focus on an focus .
So I mean babies and kids that really limit attention to one thing , and the kids that really limit attention to one thing .
But it really turns out it &apos;s very well to have a lot of data and a lot of source sources .
And if you look at their brains , what you see is that they are de@@ li@@ ag@@ ag@@ ag@@ ary as it &apos;s going to be able to recognize the learning and the mood and the prohibi@@ tion , and the parasite still won &apos;t lead .
So when you say babies and kids have problems to pay attention , what really means is that it costs not enough costs .
You like to get the interesting stuff that you could say to you , something that you might say something to you , and you &apos;re important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of awareness we have to wait for those dra@@ wers that are designed to learn from these so@@ ges that are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a way that kind of child awareness as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases in the ways we are facing a new situation in which we haven &apos;t been never before ; every time we love somebody or when we &apos;re going to play a city for the first time .
In those cases , awareness doesn &apos;t counter-@@ care , and yet it expands by it , so it seems that I think three days in Paris is a more awareness of Paris , and contribute to the audience that every month back in Paris , I &apos;m talking about walking on the way in Paris , and the audience , by taking on the way on the ground .
So , I &apos;m a coffee , that magnificent coffee that we take below , really im@@ mi@@ ties the effect of the young babies of babies .
So how is it a baby ?
It &apos;s like he &apos;s a boyfriend in Paris , and then they &apos;ll take away three ex@@ er@@ ts .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling , but we &apos;re hoping we were going to cry by 3 a.m.
But it &apos;s true .
I don &apos;t mean too much about the ones that are babies .
It &apos;s true .
We can do things like tie shoes or crossing the street .
And it has a sense that we actually put a lot of effort to do that babies think that babies are think as adults .

I &apos;m here to share my picture .
Does this is a picture ?
Because of course , this is a picture that can &apos;t take the track of your cameras .
With all of my firsthand work when I could get my first computer camera at 15 .
So I was inspired by my passion before I was to draw , and it was a little bit different , because by using the process of a lot more well in the conversation .
And when a picture hits a camera , the process ends when you follow the pulse .
To me , photography had more than to look at being in the ide@@ ologies at the same time .
I mean , I &apos;m just so sorry .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process is going to be starting on the pulse again .
F@@ ots like this : a building in a very mild the way .
But it has an unexpected gyrus .
And yet it &apos;s just a re@@ alist level .
Or photos like these , dark and colorful , but all of the time that &apos;s all the way to keep the level of re@@ alism .
When I was saying , a re@@ re@@ alist is .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can be really captured but I always want to make sure it was captured in a way like a photograph .
F@@ ots in that one &apos;s thinking to think about a moment to discover the trick .
So this has more than to look at capturing a sense that with capturing a really really .
But what is the trick that does it look true ?
Do you have to see that the details or the colors ?
Do you have to see with light ?
What does it create a illusion ?
The time the view is illusion .
But by the end of our way to interpreting the world and how it can be located on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s really not about it , it &apos;s really hard to think it &apos;s realistic .
So I think the basics are very simple .
I &apos;m a pro@@ verb that &apos;s a true reality that we take different stages of reality and the collection of us to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you an easy example .
So here we have three physical objects that we can all relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But somehow , it &apos;s also to create something that still looks three-dimensional ; how you think about it .
But at the same time , we know that there can &apos;t be .
So we &apos;re going to fix our brain because the brain just doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn &apos;t accept that it really doesn
And I see the same process by combining photos .
It &apos;s really about it in a different way .
So the things that make a realistic picture , I think that &apos;s what we don &apos;t even think ; the things that are basically defined in our life would make us .
But when we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to have account this : Because unlike the opposite , it will be a rare sense .
So I &apos;d like to say there &apos;s three simple keys that follow for achievement results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first blessing is that the combination of a very , very , very , very , very , very bottom .
Second , the combination of a kind of un@@ used to have the same kind of light .
And these two shots , the first one , to meet requirements , have been taken over the same time and the same kind of light .
The third point is to make a really understanding where they start and then follow the different images with a perfect partner .
It has to be impossible to say how to eat the picture .
Making the color , the contrast and the shine the edges in the tracks of the different images , adding up to them ex@@ tri@@ fied as flies as water and then un@@ acts , and noise , ex@@ er@@ ases like the boundaries between the different images and we do that by the fact that one sounds really sounds like .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) We could think this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom part is what was manipulated .
But this picture is totally comprised of a different fact that the whole thing is completely generated by the photos .
So , I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that tells you , because a really doesn &apos;t have to compromise the ideas that &apos;s in your head .
But this requires a lot of design .
And as I thought this thought in winter , I knew I had a little bit months to do it , to find the different ways of the world , to find the different places for the world .
For example , the fish was captured in a way out of catch .
The back is a different disconnect .
The sp@@ ines was captured in a stone .
And yeah , even though I did make the head of the summit of the island so that it &apos;s more devastating .
So to make a realistic result , I think it requires skill .
You &apos;re always going to be a ox , a sense .
So there &apos;s a different understanding of the photos .
And here &apos;s a piece of fun .
If a good job makes a good job by taking pictures the outcome of it can be very beautiful and the very very realistic and very re@@ alist .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that we &apos;re going to do is our imagination .
Thank you .
