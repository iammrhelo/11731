( Arabic ) Re@@ gi@@ er &apos;s &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; from S@@ at@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ ang@@ i , the evil . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to I think I &apos;m going to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not angry . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot;
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been on a medium of media class .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but when I was born , he was a business of business .
If his children were children or girls , if their children were boys or girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls
So I was lucky , I was lucky .
My mother was 17 times .
Of the 16 of the people , we &apos;re alive five .
You can imagine what I had to happen when I was girl .
I mean , she was thinking about women being transported to the vote , or children being brought to a tu@@ ft .
At that moment , when I ended up high school , I was going to make it a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I just want to talk , I would rather wish to college .
So , unfortunately , my country , I had no shortage of women in the denial of the way , and even though I accept the medicine of medicine , I couldn &apos;t .
As a result , my dad sent him America .
( Video ) ( Music ) ( Music ) in America .
I strapped my studies .
Whereas ended up my education , Rus@@ hom@@ u , my country , my country .
You know ? When I was finishing my training , I &apos;d rather think what was going to happen to my family and my country .
I had months , and I didn &apos;t have bad news .
My family found was a refugee camp camp .
So instead , I ended up finishing the research , brought my family America .
I wanted to have you to get safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I heard it was bad , when I was going to see the news that was going to happen in my country , I &apos;ll tell you the heart .
I would mean back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t just because I couldn &apos;t just go there .
I had good work .
It was teachers at a university .
It was good .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
So , I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my focus .
So I went back to the camp .
And when I arrived at the field of Tide , Tide was seven million and half a half and half a half and half a half million .
They were , in the 90 percent of the 90 percent women and children , and most of men or died in the war , or were there , and know ?
when I was doing the first , when I was doing the most , when I was doing the things that I don &apos;t think about .
( Video ) V@@ D : An estimated one estimate , and eight kids , sitting there , crying , crying , not knowing what to do .
I saw a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , no matter , no , no , no , no , not a place where to live .
I have kids who are lost their parents , their chickens and the age 10 or a hundred or sweet , had to climb their family , to be the head of family and try to protect their harm , their mom@@ its and their children .
The situation was absolutely un@@ bear@@ er .
My heart heart of my people and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So I was so sure that one impulse .
So I would feel like , I would feel like I can do these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m a person , I can do it for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
It turned out , he had . They p@@ as@@ ts a position .
It has confidence . They practice a career .
We took my family , bringing my family to another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my
And then we had the way that he was supposed to provide my people to education and health and that was what I tried to do .
But think was easy ?
Because not , that , women didn &apos;t have access to education .
And besides the spec@@ ter of Rus@@ va in Afghanistan was not inspired by anybody who had no confidence in any .
It was very hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who are I ?
It turns out the United States .
They &apos;re just getting up here .
They were taught me ? We don &apos;t .
So what really needed was un@@ warran@@ ted to trust this community .
How do I go to it ?
I went back , I was painting and watched .
I did ask questions .
And finally , I found a man .
He was 80 years old .
It was a m@@ erec@@ orded .
I went to her room in the g@@ ro@@ aching and gave the proposal , &quot; &quot; I want you to have a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I want you to have a teacher . &quot; &quot; I want you to become a teacher .
And I looked at it , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , hey , we think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be a teacher . &quot; &quot; And finally , he accepted my offer , and then I started with a kind of a kind of thing in his bed , she &apos;s going to the voice .
So a year ago , we had 25 schools , 15,000 schools to school , and was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
We were supposed to do our work , and we were doing our work , forming teachers , and in the Arab media , we &apos;re all sorts of good . And one day , we have a lot of good . And one day , we have a lot of good . And one day , we have a lot of good . And one day , we have a lot of good . And one day , we have a lot of good . And one day , we have a lot of good . And one
I was a day , I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , and I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , and I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , and I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day ,
And then , then I saw my entire personal school and I would think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back to my childhood and I &apos;d be saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to hate it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back to the room , &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back , you &apos;re going to do it ?
You have fear . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know , your life is at the game .
But as a leader , you have to keep your compositions .
You have to keep bringing together and show you strength@@ ening .
So I wondered , what happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people are charged in mass of my workshop .
So I invited my students to get in the office .
They lived . Eas@@ y , nine , nine .
And the most awful men you can see here , the most awful men you can see never .
( Laughter ) We have to be able to make it thin@@ g@@ ably , and it &apos;s going to make it wrong , and then they &apos;ll go into mass mass in my workshop .
And she invited me to seat and take a tea .
And they weren &apos;t going to take it .
And of course , the white l@@ ack@@ -@@ off voice that they used to be really afraid , and I was really affected .
But at the same time , I kept smiling .
And of course , I &apos;m just like you , you see it as a shell , cur@@ g of a black hi@@ ja@@ b , a black hole , a black hole , a black hole per , and it &apos;s just a moment , and it &apos;s just a moment .
The only one that was seeing me was the only one that was just the eyes of the son , the only one that had me seen me .
I wondered , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know that the school would be supposed to be a female hero ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And , know ? I was hooked and answered and I asked , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I went to the face of one saying , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s the house of somebody .
I &apos;ll meet some students . They all learned the holy book , the holy book .
You know ? The Israel@@ ites says that women were holy book , and they can obe@@ y their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) At that time , I had a talk about it . ( Laughter ) At that moment , I had been talking to you .
They talked to them and said , &quot; &quot; We are , we &apos;re going to do it , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they then offer you a little bit later and take a s@@ ane and they &apos;ll take a s@@ ate and laugh .
So my personal age was in mass of my workshop .
They were killed of fear .
Don &apos;t tell me that I don &apos;t kill me .
Don &apos;t tell me they didn &apos;t carry me out .
With all , all of you were all giant worm .
And so I &apos;m happy , and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Sure , I &apos;m going to be alive .
But also , by the way , when the Taliban were falling in the Taliban , when the Taliban had the power of the other story .
We have to have the deb@@ tors of the city and we teach the 80 to 18@@ ,000 students , three students were cl@@ unky , and we were not going to be able to cover without Ap@@ er@@ restrial .
We were in the Taliban in the Taliban , we went to the country and open a school after another .
We opened centers for women .
We opened clinics without stop .
We worked with women and children .
We &apos;re constantly productive health .
We &apos;re going to imagine how many types of technologies can imagine .
I was very happy . I was charming , and I was charming with my work .
And one day , when I was four educators , and a man , he just took the north of the coast of the road , by doing the time , and then again , we were doing the same one , by the way , by 19 kids .
So it goes backwards to the ground , blocking the road .
I asked my driver &apos;s driver who went and respond to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; You may have nothing to do with you . P@@ ris@@ sy and said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What we do ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and they have touched me .
At that time , women ber@@ ro@@ cke@@ ted in the car .
I &apos;m so affected , and I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot; &quot; So this is the end .
This time , all of us , all of us .
No doubt .
But still , when the moment comes , the game comes up , the forces of everything that you see and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You know , you know , you can follow that .
So I supported on one side of the car .
My leg was stripped and out of the car .
You may ask , &quot; &quot; How can I help them ? &quot; &quot; They know what I was going to answer ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
She rides a place of a place to another .
Teaching women , we &apos;re also telling them to have a chance to have a job .
Do you want to go . What do you look like ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; What about the no@@ ch@@ re ?
What we &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; M@@ ight us and re@@ gained me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
We know , the only one we can do , for time , is to reject a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know anymore . They know what it means .
Obviously , it was a mer@@ a .
So I went back and said , &quot; &quot; No , we &apos;ll go back and say &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; and I walked on the car , I sat down and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back and go and go to the office . &quot; &quot; So we just helped the women .
We just had money to teach them to them , to send them to the school , and nothing else .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all of the very big educators .
They &apos;re going to go to their homes . No .
My mother was the only one he was there and I had no voice .
I was con@@ sp@@ ic@@ king , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do I get to do this problem ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do to do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How am I going to do this ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do to do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How am I going to do this ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do
Because we &apos;re offering education in the north .
C@@ oul@@ kers of guess what we teach them .
So I was sitting there and suddenly , and suddenly we &apos;re talking about pulses , because we &apos;re just talking about pulses , because we &apos;re a moment of mine , one of my wishes , a report .
And he called me &quot; &quot; L@@ k@@ k@@ ar ? &quot; &quot; And I answered .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What you &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I was trained .
It was equal to him , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t untie myself and ask .
&quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s going .
I told her all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , you &apos;re going to go and give them .
And when two days later , I did , I did the same way , and I know that ? They didn &apos;t have a little bit further , the same kids , the same kids , the same kids , the same kids , the ri@@ fl@@ est and our way to stop the car .
So I stopped the car .
I &apos;m going to go and say , &quot; &quot; Okay , come to me . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I think . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a condition .
So I took the mosque and to sum , I told them I was going to be the teachers .
Now , they are the best educators .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn to sound , and they are my own .
The whole areas that don &apos;t have been in the mountain zones , they come with me . They go and go .
And the protocells .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That is the reason education change people .
When you educate people , they are and in the way , we need to work as equality .
You can &apos;t educate women and they forgot to men , because men are people who are actually the most difficult people in women .
( Laughter ) So we started pasting them , because they have to be conscious of the ability of women , knowing how much it &apos;s the ability to have the men and that women can break the same ones themselves .
So we form men continuously , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think profoundly deeply , and I think
I live in a country that I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , <unk> .
We &apos;re all the parts .
Women were going to have education : angry , engineers , teachers , the teachers ... and we go home home .
We don &apos;t apply the doors .
But you know , you know , my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of security problems .
But we still want to be a win .
And I want to get another part .
Now , the women of Afghanistan are very , very hard .
Look at it . Be angry if you &apos;re going to be angry .
They study to be doctors , again .
They study to be teachers and run business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use their whole capacity and all this will happen .
I want to share with you by love , by compassion , confidence and honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;re going to succeed .
We have a poet , Ma@@ w@@ a@@ us R@@ it@@ om@@ a@@ <unk> .
He said that if you have compassion and if you have love , and then you have to make the world .
And I would go to it , we were able to .
And if we were able to make it , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that any anything can do .
Thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you ,

There &apos;s 10 years ago , a phone called my life .
So I was a cardio@@ logist at UC@@ LA to California , Los Angeles of California , the heart rate of heart .
And I was told myself was a veter@@ o@@ id of the Z@@ o Ze@@ o C@@ ro@@ d .
One old chimpanzees are expected to be facial expression and PTSD to the veter@@ inary spirits of the brain that was a brain injury .
You may have me if you could go to the zoo to search for a possible cause cause of heart disease .
It will let the United States of course , the Neanderthals in the United States with the most disastrous , highly sovereign , highly sovereign , very excellent .
But sometimes , you &apos;ll be able to make a medical community , especially for some new medical services , especially for some new medical students , especially for some medical students , especially for some medical students , especially for some medical students , especially for some medical students , especially for some medical students , but sometimes it will mean to make a difference , and sometimes it &apos;s going to be able to make a better health community , especially for some new medical students , especially for some new medical students , especially for some
It pulls out the brain to brain brain imaging in the case of this chimpanzees , and then they &apos;re downloaded this entire entire body by a possible suit , and then I watched the sil@@ ker of this le@@ elly piece was no inflammation . I &apos;m this picture , but I &apos;ve been in this picture , and I &apos;ve adapted the heart of a le@@ ker of aluminum and doctors in what we &apos;re doing with 700 ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ shed of fluent bags that are all of their heart .
And this one thing is , I &apos;ve already been in many human patients , and it &apos;s an identical , with the exception of that bar@@ p and that glue .
Because by electronic symptoms , diagnostics and treatments have been driven by symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for mine ; for their animals .
And when instead , the same day went to the L.A. College Medical Center at UC@@ LA &apos;s L.A.
And I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started
So basically , doctors and activists are not just the same as a single disease , and it &apos;s basically doctors and activists themselves themselves as the same diseases in their human patients , and animals : in@@ defen@@ mizing the senti@@ ments , liver brain , noninvasive nitrogen , and autop@@ i@@ tis .
Well , I have to do a fall@@ out by me .
I still studied compared to compared to compared biology and biology during college — even in my dorm , and the evolutionary biology of Darwin — learning more about the meaningful rate of Darwin &apos;s mon@@ gering and human is a very necessary touch touch for me .
And I started asking me how I could be , with all these coinci@@ dences , who never get to the point of an in@@ tal@@ tal@@ -like speaker , to have another one of my own patients or to have another version of one of my patients ?
Would we have never seen a veter@@ in@@ um ?
But more , more , rather , should be surprising ?
Every doctors embrace a biological connections between animals and humans .
All the medicines we prescribe , we take that we have our own families , we take them into a animal .
But there &apos;s a great difference between giving a animal or innov@@ ator or innov@@ ator of human disease , and that animal develops itself to itself un@@ benefited heart or cancer cells .
Maybe , part of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ent world is growing between the urban and the water .
We listen to the United States , we listen to the rest of the world , or the end of a plant .
Hosp@@ it@@ als today are actually becoming more in the days of the other living community of technology .
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients that are there and the patients that live in the ocean , on the f@@ ounding and in the jun@@ ks of the way .
But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason :
We have to provide the findings and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists , and scientists and scientists , and scientists , and scientists , and scientists , and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists
But in our indoors , we don &apos;t end up .
I &apos;m interested in myself when I go to Mozart or I see my Mozart or I see the Mar@@ ms R@@ ape .
I feel that called the human human fact , but yet recognize the cost of human human being , and yet by telling .
Well , this s@@ ore is now .
Now , when I see the patient with a human patient , I always wondered , what know the doctors of animals about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
What would you do better to my human patient if you look and look at my human patient if you look and like a human animal ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the suggestion of connections that led me to this kind of reason .
In@@ sec@@ ted heart heart disease .
A@@ .@@ M.

It was a Marine in a ski father of the game that lost savings savings in a part of life , a few leaves in the altar of the altar .
But it turns out that this new diagnosis is not new or human and human and human and human .
The veter@@ in@@ ators were already used by expressing the while , trying and even cure premature symptoms divide in animals , from monkeys to co@@ ach the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@ ra@@ fts , the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@ ra@@ fts , the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@ ra@@ fts , the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@ ra@@ fts , the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@ ra@@ fts , the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@ ra@@ fts , the co@@ ra@@ gi , the co@@
How many of the human lives could actually save if this robotic knowledge is reduced to the Neanderthals of the doctor &apos;s doctor and the cardiac of the grocery ?
Au@@ th@@ missions .
Some patients are just like themselves .
You have to get it .
Some patients also also are also self-@@ man@@ ab@@ themselves .
There are so@@ ites that live die in the grass and again , until it &apos;s gone to sandwich .
But the rest of us have very specific forms and it &apos;s ability to treat and yet to treat the animal in animals that behave like this .
It shouldn &apos;t be this awareness by the Neanderthals of psycho@@ therap@@ ists , &apos; parents and the patients who are fighting the hall@@ marks ?
I can take pressure and psychotic , and if I was going to run it up .
Sometimes , by little , giving birth some men fall in depression , sometimes in severe states , and still in psychotic states .
You can reject their own child , and in cases like extreme arriving , it &apos;s going to shine the man@@ ta .
The veter@@ in@@ ners of ca@@ p@@ ies know also that when instead of being a little bit after the age , it can reject its hy@@ d@@ as , and they deny it , and some cases , they just patho@@ sts it , and some cases , they just pat@@ ented it up .
But the veter@@ in@@ ters have a treatment to address this syndrome of poll@@ ut@@ tive poll@@ ut@@ ants than we &apos;re producing in oxytocin of water .
Ox@@ gl@@ é is the hormone hormone , and it causes water to get interested in their hy@@ d@@ .
Could it be that information to the Neanderthals and the Neanderthals , &apos; doctors , family physicians and the patients who are faced with the cries of them and the doctor who are faced with the deb@@ tors and the doctor who are faced with the deb@@ ors and the doctor who are faced with the deb@@ ors and the doctor who are faced with the deb@@ ors and the patient who are faced with the deb@@ ors and the patient who are faced with the deb@@ ors and the patient who are faced with the deb@@ ors and
Despite the fact that it &apos;s all this , the distance between our entire own remains of our time .
To explain it , a lot of my faith , I &apos;m really afraid I &apos;ll have to put some of the evidence in action .
There are doctors who can be truly identical with the Neanderthals that are not impacting medicine .
I mean , the dentist , op@@ t@@ apping , and psychologists , but especially the veter@@ in@@ ies .
Of course , most doctors have no idea that it &apos;s harder to get in days in a starving Comm@@ ta College of V@@ i@@ tion@@ -like Medicine in a medicine of medicine , and when we go to medicine we learn everything is relevant to a species , the Neanderthals , but the ways of learning about health and disease and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the veter@@ in@@ ators for the insurance of the offspring and the defen@@ tor of my fellow teens .
So here &apos;s a part of the human part of the human world : how do you call a veter@@ in@@ ury that only knows how you can just treat a species ?
Doctor graphy that when I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a passion , and I &apos;m doing it through programs like Darwin &apos;s at UC@@ L@@ E at UC@@ L@@ R , in UC@@ L@@ L@@ R , we are creating the experts in animals and biologists to engage our medical student of our own residents and residents .
And through the world of Ze@@ it@@ thal@@ a , we have to invite us to have a prize for us to make medical education and V@@ eter@@ ter@@ ers by keep educated about the disease and the disorders of the animals .
In the scientific cortex , Ze@@ an@@ ama@@ us learned how to do the treatment of a clean chest of chest hair , the better treating cancer cancer , can be able to improve the cancer from a philosophical child , like the understanding of the minority of a cow , can deliver the treatment of a child &apos;s own child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s license to serve a child to be able to be cured by the early ones .
In the world with Ze@@ an@@ ani , first in America , and now all over the world , doctors and activists leave their own and si@@ sts and collect them as a child like the same as a man .
And finally , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s time for us to doctors , doctors , and we could allow us to make sure that we are doctors , and we can connect to veter@@ inary people in a particular life that ranges all species .
Because it turns out that some of the best episodes and humani@@ sts are being restricted by magnets that are not humans .
And one of the best ways to treat the human patient is to be able to ask a lot of attention to how everybody &apos;s other patients on the planet , and then grow , and then they go .
Thank you very much .

Life , a complex human being , is by medical data : the Neanderthals , the medical test , the list of the lab .
Suddenly make a test in a disease with legs .
doctors start to talk a symptom that you don &apos;t understand .
And then they &apos;ll signal out with your finger your body and your heart and your trunk .
People starts to change also because they start to treat Parkinson &apos;s disease instead of a person .
You ask , &quot; &quot; What you would tell you about ? &quot; &quot; Before I said , &quot; &quot; Hello , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; Hello , &quot; &quot; so I &apos;m so excited about questions for the questions that no one answer .
You ask the guy who — who ?
Are you who to study ? Did you make love ?
You see , &quot; &quot; What did I do to do that ? &quot; &quot; P@@ ick@@ en@@ es , &quot; &quot; I can change something in my life ? &quot; &quot; P@@ ick@@ en@@ es , &quot; &quot; Could exist something you can do ?
There &apos;s another option : &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the kind of good guys in all of these cases , because they &apos;re very dirty and comprom@@ ised .
But they &apos;re also so used to treat patients , so I would say sometimes they &apos;re lost the angle of a place that you &apos;re in a pot of a pot that you have , and you become literally a patient in a patient . &quot; &quot; Re@@ su@@ mption means &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Re@@ conscious means &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Re@@ conscious means &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Re@@ conscious means &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; meaning . &quot; &quot; Re@@ conscious
( Laughter ) Things are changing but the typical thing is that we should take any way to know your situation , to do the wrong thing , to make your family your family and friends or teach you some ways of changing your lifestyle risks than you &apos;re going to pass .
But with all , thank you to take your hands on a very rough thin number .
Whereas I was in the hospital , I asked myself , my sister &apos;s understanding of my dog .
It was very hard to get it , because it &apos;s not very common to ask a photo of your own .
I talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t tell me , I don &apos;t tell me .
I &apos;m more like this .
The cure , whatever it is , will have to face all my own . &quot; &quot; So the next day I went back from the hospital to recommend@@ ation of a doctor .
I was really sure I &apos;ll change my relationship to the dog and she was making it much more about him before he did something as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several types of technologies , open and open my work .
So my big bet was just getting out , just using information , and it &apos;s just a way that any could take away from it .
So I &apos;ve created a website called &quot; La C@@ ro@@ se@@ , &quot; &quot; by &quot; La C@@ ro@@ ar@@ ar , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La C@@ ro@@ se@@ , &quot; &quot; by &quot; La C@@ ro@@ ar@@ ar , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La C@@ ro@@ se@@ , &quot; &quot; by &quot; La C@@ ro@@ ar@@ ar , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La C@@ ro@@ se@@ , &quot; &quot; by &quot; La C@@ ro@@ ar@@ ar , &quot; &quot; which I
I had to have to have to have to do it , but that &apos;s why we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) So I picked this word , &quot; La C@@ ro@@ ma , &quot; &quot; because in the Italian , it means &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding
In our Western culture means to eradicate or to do it to go back to the disease disease , but in other cultures , like example of Asia , from the nor@@ thwestern National Science , can represent a lot of other things .
So I was supposed to be interested in the opinion of doctors and the rest of the health , but I was also interested in the summit for the performer , by the poet , by designing , by designing , or not , by musicians .
I was interested in the social quality , I was interested in the psychological pre@@ conceptions , I was interested in the greatest visionary record of the world , I was interested in the same type of cur@@ ation .
And it worked .
The site developed &quot; &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u &quot; &quot; around the world .
I was a lot of med@@ anity from Italy and the foreign 50-@@ 50-@@ billion people in the middle of the world , and over 30,000 people in contact with me in very little time through the social media , social media — most of them were providing opportunities for how to heal me as a person .
For example , it has been thousands of videos , images , photos and represent art to La C@@ op@@ k .
We have the example of Franc@@ o F@@ i and his act .
Or what did the Ex@@ en@@ alist An@@ ly L@@ ich@@ ty : E@@ ter@@ -based sculpture or a sculpture in 3D printing of my tumor and I can &apos;t see it in It .
Now you can see my dog !
( Laughter ) If you think about it , it &apos;s really cool , and you can share the same .
And this was what I was going to happen : scientific , experts in traditional medicine , a lot of doctors , doctors ... all were connected to me .
Given all of this information and support , I became able to put together a brain team of brain imaging , physicians , onco@@ logists and various volunteers , I could talk to you about the data that I could get to talk about , which is really important .
People are able to formul@@ ate a different strategy from my own di@@ di@@ logical , and as the different cultures .
So the strategy would be slowing down the entire world and thousands of years of human history , something that I find quite a lot of really struck .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; &#93; E@@ tor .
So I could take my time to choose .
I picked up the doctor I wanted to work , I chose the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the time thousands of people were supporting me to feel sorry for me .
Everybody felt that he could be stopped by helping me , and this was the most important part of the C@@ ro@@ n@@ ment .
Did you do what ?
I &apos;m good , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) I &apos;m app@@ alled great , after surgery : I have — I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m — a link link in a way that &apos;s a good thing that doesn &apos;t make a lot of .
I was fully my life and my life lifestyle .
It was very intense , and I had a network of stra@@ gging , and it was very intense , and I had a network of stra@@ gging my brain , and then we could build a functional map of what the brain is controlling .
And just before we were , we were able to analyze this map with the doctor who would run out , and if there was one thing I would like to avoid it , if I would have been able to take this map with the risks that would run , if I would have some of you to avoid this map with the risks that would run , if I would have been able to analyze it .
Obviously , there are no way .
This to make it very hard to La C@@ op@@ k .
Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
The doctors came to talk to people in the poor who have no consul@@ ted , when it comes from .
I think I think I &apos;m in a continuous state of translation among many different languages , where the science is found with the same thing , and the traditional research with the traditional .
&#91; SO@@ LE@@ E@@ &#93; A@@ AD@@ E &#93; The key to La C@@ ur@@ <unk> E@@ <unk> , the key to La C@@ ur@@ al E@@ <unk> , and the key that Professor C@@ ro@@ ck was felt part of a truly significant society in the middle of each of its individuals .

I don &apos;t have a sense of what we &apos;re going to play .

The choreograp@@ h , as we call it , is a remarkable space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that they do that they do is that it doesn &apos;t take us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
We &apos;re really alive at this moment .
There are many decisions when they &apos;re going to the choreograp@@ me .
We didn &apos;t have the idea of what we were going to touch .
So we had a story of a song called &quot; &quot; The B@@ loom . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
You &apos;re all listening . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the harm .
So the idea of a mistake : from a musician from a musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about the mistake of someone else &apos;s mistake .
The way I &apos;m good for a mistake I &apos;m in the choreograp@@ h — before nothing else , we don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake to peace in that is not who I are not who to perceive it , it &apos;s what else did it .
So each mistake is an opportunity in the entire field .
Even it &apos;s hard to do what it would be fun .
For example , if you &apos;re a color , like you &apos;re going to walk , it &apos;s like this ...
( Music ) If you walk a bill down a bill ... like F@@ old .
See , it &apos;s all fits in the way of color .
If it comes to M@@ i .
See , all of it is the inside of this particular emotional charge that we &apos;re painting .
But if we touch our # i@@ de speaking , most of you are going to think about it a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this .
At some point , they &apos;ll add up to this bill .
And we don &apos;t let go to it .
It &apos;s just touching it for a second , and then let me stop and I &apos;ll talk a moment .
We &apos;re going to see it &apos;s what happens when we touch this tu@@ ft .
( Music ) ( Music ) Now , if you don &apos;t , somebody might concede that as a mistake .
I would just guess it &apos;s a mistake about a mistake if we don &apos;t adverti@@ se in the way .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s un@@ qui@@ ver@@ ous . We &apos;re painting this again again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to push it , but something else will change .
We &apos;re going to make their ideas either , or not .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Video ) HG : You &apos;ll have his bill .
And I created a melody .
This time the texture changed the way .
It was a little more financially , a little more in a way more in my response .
So no mistake .
The only mistake is if not any conscious , if every musician is not conscious , and they don &apos;t recognize their partners to in@@ corporate the idea and we &apos;re not going to allow their creativity .
This is really incredible .
It &apos;s an extremely stressful experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking about everyone when I say we don &apos;t do it .
We know that being able to climb the choreograp@@ h and make music is a blessing .
And what does this do is do this with the financing ?
We are all musicians of our own lungs , our stereotyp@@ o is not the most right .
( Laughter ) So I just wanted to show you how we &apos;re facing .
And the other one is that we don &apos;t make micro@@ -@@ <unk> os .
There are people who do it .
But that includes the art of the art .
If I tell you to the band that touched me , I want to make it and so I say to you , and I say to you .
I &apos;m something .
One , two , two , three , three , four .

I mean , &quot; &quot; A@@ tie me on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music , I &apos;m going to make it , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It &apos;s more than to see what I can perceive as what I can do .
If I want to make music from a certain level of awe , the first step to me is being patient , listen , what happens to me , re@@ taking something that happens to me .
When you do , you pay and inspire to the other musicians and they dance more , and so you &apos;ll do it .
One two , two , two , three , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Video ) It &apos;s something totally different when I filmed my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s got many more masses .
It &apos;s not about to take my vision .
We &apos;re going to be at the moment , acceptance of one another and let go of the other and let creativity .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to be s@@ er@@ ous , so this amazing of these amazing talks that are being exposed to , inv@@ enti@@ tionally in the early 70s , the way we climb on the television &apos;s television .
Everybody sees the television sees television .
I like . I like you to do some things .
Here in America people .
The average person sees the television is almost five hours a day .
Well ?
H@@ um , I live in television , so I think it &apos;s something practical .
But the many people don &apos;t like .
They were , of fact , un@@ used z@@ aria .
It &apos;s useless , and things are useless .
My mother , when I was a girl , she &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Bot@@ ox &quot; &quot; the silver box . My intention is not to pass on if there &apos;s a good television or television television , my view of it today is telling me that television has consciousness .
If I think television has consciousness is because I think television would emphasize that moral moral , social policy and emotional policy has been made of all of our n@@ est@@ y@@ ics of our n@@ ion .
All of that is intrinsic to humans and has changed our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk today about good television or bad .
We talk about popular television .
We talk about the 10 programs of audience for a 50 years .
Like that index doesn &apos;t just happen to the assumption that it &apos;s the notion of our social unconscious and collective social and collective social consciousness , if you don &apos;t , like those 10 programs in the age of the world has the idea of our social consciousness ?
How can we evolve the television over time , and that tells our society our society ?
By leveraging evolution , we &apos;re going to be a basic biology of evolution , from a basic biology , if you take away the animal kingdom , human , human , has four basic neurons .
They are , relationships , power , and the desire to get .
As humans , what we think is that we evolved in our time , evolved with time to poke or master these different animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We were angry , compassion .
This isn &apos;t the animal kingdom .
The other thing is true human beings , is that we love the fun .
I love to see television .
This is something that &apos;s happening in the animal &apos;s world .
By animals , you can &apos;t get to play , but you don &apos;t get to you .
So we figure out what it understands from this relationship to human trafficking among the television shows and moral awareness .
Why is the wrong thing ?
The kid has been asked like the shoe of the monkey , and the angel sitting in our shoulder .
W@@ ab@@ television works like our consciousness , try and affect the same time ?
To start the challenge of these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
We launched 50 years of the 19@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@ 5@@
We &apos;ve made the top 20 of the audience from the audience &apos;s reporting rate that &apos;s 50 years old — thousands of programs .
We talk about 3,000 people nearly 3@@ 600 ... from 18 and 70 years , and we asked how they were emotionally .
How did you feel you can find each of these programs ?
Did you meet a moral deal ?
Did you feel clear ? Do you know ?
What meant for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean this was taken out in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of use emotional age are universal .
And second the accomplishments , an 80 percent of the most popular programs are ex@@ ori@@ ent in the rest of the world .
I wish our audiences to make sure that our political audiences are really identified .
I want to breathe through the two people before I &apos;d pass it on the first slide , and so the hell really inspired me to think about it , and the flaws that consciousness can take us on the day day , gave the reason for the legitimate en@@ serv@@ ry , Jack <unk> n .
And so what I &apos;m going to get to the data , I want to breathe through the re@@ known director &apos;s director &apos;s director &apos;s understanding of the world , who would be living .
Well , let &apos;s go .
Here you see , since 1960 , the 18@@ 70s of our study .
There are two things we &apos;re going to start the state of the inspirational state and the state of a moral age , which in this study , we define the violent programs that tells me that I &apos;m going to make me feel better with the world .
The am@@ iority , moral age , are the programs that don &apos;t buy the difference between good and wrong .
At first , you see that in 1960 , the inspirational success of 1960 .
So we see television .
The am@@ iority , moral age starts to make it .
We &apos;re far more than 60 , the am@@ erec@@ orded moral age increases , and the bottom words is low .
Why ?
The crisis of C@@ uba and the P@@ uba crisis , the re@@ in@@ act and J@@ FC , the movement of the T@@ en@@ zy , the Latin War , the Vietnam War , the murder of M@@ art@@ ate , the murder of M@@ ouse &apos;s M@@ ouse &apos;s M@@ ap@@ <unk> .
Look what happens .
1970 the violent / it was stopped .
The am@@ inity moral man discou@@ raged .
You put it , the more you get the poin@@ ter , a television director , it &apos;s in control .
It &apos;s about to raise the flight .
But it &apos;s okay , it can &apos;t be : S@@ itting , the I@@ ath , the disaster of Ch@@ ris@@ la@@ ge@@ en@@ ge@@ om@@ en@@ ge@@ om@@ ic , Chernobyl .
The am@@ iority as a moral , gets the dominant , very much dominant , very following 20 years .
So , take a look at this .
So this graph shows a similar trend .
But in this case , we have the happiness that &apos;s made the red carpet , and the in@@ rever@@ tion in blue and green will .
At that time in television , we have &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy Gri@@ de , &quot; &quot; and we have the &quot; &quot; An@@ dy Gri@@ de , &quot; &quot; and we have a national , and national computer that reflects happiness .
It goes to increase , and happiness ab@@ uses it .
The rever@@ tic starts to rise .
It has to be changed in social tax increases .
We are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones who are , the Neanderthals and the things we do .
happiness , the ir@@ ge@@ ries and social social , not just fighting our society , but there are two programs , &quot; &quot; G@@ ap@@ ake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ost &quot; &quot; which in fact are number two and number three of the rate in the rate .
What was the number one ?
The series of Phys@@ pi@@ ous and socially un@@ rever@@ ent , and the Israel@@ ites &apos; &apos;s C@@ Ds &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Row , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot;
They all live together .
The spec@@ t@@ Line was made .
Let &apos;s see this peak in 196@@ 6 with a password pain .
When you hear the term , success is successful , you mean ?
I mean , in 196@@ 6 , the French S@@ uc@@ om@@ ers &quot; &quot; I am told you are the way .
This was the first program that lets the argument , &quot; my god , I can comment I think of the War of Vietnam , about the president , through television , through television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television , through the television ,
Well , the same way in the last one of the look what happens .
1970 , the rand@@ o was handed . I was struck .
We don &apos;t see television by touching it .
The social status and the tw@@ inti@@ mi@@ fied edges over the 70s .
Now this is this .
Who was going to the 70 ? You &apos;ve Le@@ ar .
We have &quot; &quot; Happy for &quot; &quot; San@@ ford and I &apos;m &quot; &quot; the main &quot; &quot; and the main program going on the 10 over the &apos; 70s &apos;s &apos; 70s . &quot; &quot; M@@ AS : The whole thing for the entire &apos; 70s , &apos; M@@ L@@ E .
In the 50 years of television we study , seven of the most un@@ documented programs were passed away from the Vietnam War , five of the heel during the announced .
So one generation in the 20 years , and we &apos;ve learned , to do it , to do it , to do that ?
Could I feel that ?
Does change change ?
So this audience was so familiar , I want to tell you that the people of the digital didn &apos;t invent the problems .
Archie grabbed the way out of his bo@@ wel ship with the rest of us , with the rest of us .
This is another one of the other — with other kinds of other kinds of things , like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really sorry , I &apos;m not just like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really sure , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; make me better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the story of the current achievement of the Civil Rights Movement .
I mean every time I was being angry and easy , and imagination will go out , and it &apos;s a way of the way .
We want to see programs about saving money and in the Neanderthals ?
No . We have the se@@ se@@ ment of the emerging &quot; &quot; The machine &quot; &quot; that was cataly@@ zing the way the heel look 10 in the way , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million of dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Phil@@ osop@@ us . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s — another peak of the U.S.
What would there were those programs ?
G@@ am@@ e and rich .
&quot; &quot; T@@ M@@ acy &apos;s &quot; &quot; .
A stable increased that &apos;s showing out of our national national national and made possible , the way we do it .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
You &apos;re either not in my so@@ ck strike , safe you have heard or read these on the fall of the herd of the experiences and the up@@ mark of reality .
As we say in this h@@ itch@@ de , X brand a place .
The heart , the decade of humor , you &apos;re like &quot; &quot; F@@ end@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But it &apos;s okay : X brand a place .
As 2001 , in September of 2001 , the mood is un@@ <unk> ing the judgment .
Why not ?
We had the Neanderthals 2,000 cases by the Su@@ mi@@ ma Desert .
The wo@@ o bl@@ ending de g@@ ul@@ la .
The bottom of September .
The anti@@ h@@ ang@@ as is part of social determin@@ ants .
It &apos;s going to be touched in time .
In the 20th century , the advent of the del@@ ap@@ e@@ its , the ability of the fun@@ e@@ its .
What do people want to do with their television ?
I would think it &apos;s binding or des@@ ired .
I &apos;m interested in happiness , my world are still below .
Don &apos;t , they want to judge .
I can get my art outside of the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin dance .
I can choose to show the new triump@@ h . You &apos;re going to get rid of it .
Does it do it ?
And that radically different different kinds of shows that are these programs from pure lat@@ t-@@ hy@@ dness , they were there for 50 years — that was what I said at the beginning of it ? See a basic instinct .
We are animals , we need our mom@@ .
There was no television decade without an im@@ plausible and dominant mother and mother tele@@ visions .
At the 1930s , ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Video ) At the end of the summit : C@@ ang@@ í@@ it &apos;s &quot; &quot; Le@@ g@@ en@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Take it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Take it , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Be@@ autiful Be@@ autiful &quot; &quot; through the very au@@ pr@@ ose of the social consciousness .
Mau@@ de F@@ el , the archaeological arche@@ le@@ p@@ as , the archaeological tro@@ ffle , the same kind of un@@ used all@@ u@@ ous , the way of the television , the same kind of in@@ used in television .
In the 1980s , the first one was the same &quot; &quot; low &quot; &quot; low the way of Alex@@ is Car@@ ington .
All of the president Murray Brown v@@ ine@@ z when he came to the idea of being a single violin titan .
The mother of this was , and he &apos;s Van C@@ p Van .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a stroke or a angel in your consciousness , sitting in our television , what I know is that I love this picture .
So all of you , women and men from TED@@ W@@ it@@ <unk> , the audience of TED@@ W@@ s , thank you by letting me feel the concept of consciousness .
But I also let me give the cre@@ eds through the ser@@ vers to get up to the morning to get the ideas in our daily screens for the years .
Dan &apos;s life on television , safe , but you like a spec@@ t@@ ator , through the social media , and it &apos;s going to life , longevity , power or not .
So thank you very much .

I had a Cam@@ p in a Cam@@ p , and I met a 12@@ -year-old child who had been told about the first one .
And by the way , the eyes of the U.S. aff@@ ec@@ ino , which had written in political prisoners , never had a letter no letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t a 12@@ -year-old boy who had something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a politician in a politician .
It was a 12@@ -year-old child who stole a bicycle .
What I was also told was that not only in Cam@@ ero@@ a , but the 1@@ 13 countries in the developing world that tortured the right to the right to the right to one another , and the right thing that is the reason I have provided the right to one another and right to be the right to not be li@@ kable .
And what I found was that there was an incredible incredible opportunity for all of us to be able to be able to be able to make a better community method method .
I often think of the way we think about the way that we have a policy form or that it is reserved for the Neanderthals , but actually , 95 percent of the tor@@ ary of today &apos;s tor@@ ta are not to live in political prisoners .
I &apos;m for people who are in the poor systems in court , and unfortunately , we have been able to be the cheapest way of research — it &apos;s cheaper to research that &apos;s cheaper than having a stronger system , cheaper than having a car or a willingness to handle the health of men .
The day of this co@@ res , that &apos;s possible for us as a world , if we take that decision , if we take that decision , then we take that decision , then we put that , then we would have three things , put it in the way method , but this is a little bit of three things .
First of all , the ability to empower and the wealth of the global defenses scale .
The second is to make sure that there &apos;s a temper@@ ous and systematic body of accidents .
And the third is the commitment .
So the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we were allowed ?
Could we do something by those countries ?
And I founded the In@@ tro@@ phy of the Resistance , which has a particular specific mission to end with the same way method and put together in practice of performances that are commonly used in these countries , by leveraging ratings , by a early stage in Commission@@ er and in the courts .
So my first cartoon came from Cam@@ bodi@@ a and my first visit of my first visit to Cam@@ p , when I was in the midst of a half-@@ half-@@ inch , because K@@ mer K@@ hal@@ o killed everyone .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 ru@@ g@@ d in the country , and so on , so much , in a non-@@ eloqu@@ ent , a man who &apos;s 12 years old , but when you &apos;re asked , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to do this for 10 years because my husband commit a hy@@ me , but you can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a place where there didn &apos;t exist the right condition .
The first group of defenses I &apos;ve joined up and I don &apos;t remember , as I laughed , I wonder , &quot; &quot; Well , what do we mean to research ?
And the room were in silence , and finally , a woman stood up , &#91; name &#93; &quot; &quot; K@@ audi@@ ble . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ <unk> , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ <unk> , one percent of people and I &apos;m saying to do a teacher , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a lot more than ever before , because they &apos;re all of conf@@ ot@@ ers , and we &apos;re talking about doing any research , because they &apos;re all
And these defenses were given to value the value of value to decide that they would be able to defend themselves and support them to make a set of practice in the laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came from , the 25 together , she &apos;s going to go and the rest of it , and they were supportive of the rest , and they were supportive of the same way the ones were saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , we &apos;re not going to do things like the same way we have to have done . &quot; &quot; But one day came up , and he was sitting outside of a house .
She said that really seen the person going to go to the person to come and then released the young people in a matter of a matter , but the police came , and I had nothing on top .
For that then she was hooked . He had a hard hair . I had an abortion .
And when he brought his case in a neighborhood , I had a shot , and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no case in the case of the mer@@ maid and so it will be translated into freedom . &quot; &quot; And the defenses he started started taking cases over the course of Cam@@ p &apos;s story and the defenses I &apos;ve started started taking cases of the course of Cam@@ p &apos;s story .
But Cam@@ it &apos;s not sounds .
He was thinking : so it &apos;s just Cam@@ a@@ us ?
Or should they also be other countries ?
But it turns out so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it
In the Bur@@ har@@ i came in a trunk , and there was a eight-@@ year-old boy , a mobile phone , a mobile phone cell , and a mobile phone cell had a cell phone cell phone .
Or a woman , paste on your baby , a beautiful beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is as beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m , but I &apos;m here , but I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I know , but I &apos;m so busy , but I &apos;m not in the way .
And when I went with the CEO of the Mar@@ p@@ , I said , &quot; &quot; You must let it give it in freedom .
A pounding will let it loose on it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can &apos;t talk to it , but look at my own Eas@@ y-@@ , &apos; Okay , but look at my own way , 80 percent of the two billion people are here are without av@@ ant-@@ gar@@ de .
And we realized it wasn &apos;t just the most peaceful , but the connection of the av@@ om@@ ard that counts .
For example , in Cam@@ bodi@@ a , what happened was that &#91; &quot; &quot; French &quot; &quot; &#93; was not sounds but he had the 24 / 7 , and the same way , in China , always me , always me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the desert when we can put it in &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the desert when we can put it in &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a cool wind with the &#93; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m &quot;
And then this is , &quot; &quot; But what we can &apos;t help you to create the lack of resources and we don &apos;t have resources , and then we can &apos;t help the conventional needs to have no harm for the harm . &quot; &quot; And with this organization , it &apos;s really important for the harm .
So , the solution we found was the solution that we found was the very good and then the very early , the access to the whole .
I was so little I &apos;ve been in Fi@@ lip@@ back and decided to put me with another group of stra@@ o@@ chi@@ al . What was me told was they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , now we don &apos;t have the streets in the streets , and the police is one of the main reasons why we had to say , &quot; &quot; Look at the tens of millions of dollars in the developing system system . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here are tens of millions of millions of dollars in the
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And I put me with a design rating of development agencies and were forming the same , the normal thing , the way the defenses &apos; the defen@@ rors of the way they were doing , and they were forming the normal reflection on the corner of the defenses .
It &apos;s also a manual who was done was great .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it .
They were perfectly formed .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before everybody came to the R@@ and@@ or , who would have come to them as if they were ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , I said , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ tu@@ o@@ chi@@ ans . &quot;
And so the key thing is not just the very good news from the av@@ om@@ et , but to find a way to make a way to make a practice in practice systematically , because they are actually the exception of the system for the people who are being killed .
And while I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; yeah , &quot; &quot; of course , it seems like if you could do it , but we can do it really , really , really , really , like this .
And they are so many the reason I think it &apos;s possible .
The first one is that people about the ther@@ oc@@ son have been the way that we create miracles with a miracles that &apos;s made of a miracles .
And it &apos;s not just In@@ no@@ m , who I told you in the political , but also defenses all around the world are getting the key of the key .
We have a program called E@@ <unk> Ma@@ <unk> , and we realized there were drowning and that I wanted to help , but how could we support them ?
It &apos;s only a contest in line where you can have five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to have any of the groundbreaking if you &apos;re going to have any innovation in order to put your entire performance .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> Ma@@ er@@ Ma@@ it@@ ers around the world , from C@@ DC to South Africa , or the Republic of Congo , which we had five dollars for this incredible incredible incredible thing , through the cybersecurity industry , and any way that you find a lot .
And there &apos;s not only these <unk> al@@ Ma@@ k@@ ers , but there are also people who are understood that they are actually their contacts , how they can move themselves .
For example , in China , the laws that im@@ bi@@ sts have changed the way the cops are supposed to have been punished .
And while I was sitting in the way , one of our tweets , I said , &quot; &quot; How can we get rid of it ? How can we make it look at what do you do in practice ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I mean , we &apos;re still so much so we &apos;ve found the way . &quot; &quot; And the four of the
I talked about the fact that we need to form and support the defenses .
We need to make practice in practice in practice by failing to be able to handle .
But the third and final point , is that we commit it to this .
And often people said me , &quot; &quot; Well this is very good , but it &apos;s too idealistic .
I would come back . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think of this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same point that you use or the people who decide to finish with the same man who &apos;s been used to be or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who have decided to take them .
One of our poems of the defenses are the defenses they share themselves , is , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s more valuable , friends , the way it &apos;s been , the way it &apos;s going to be a lot of , and there &apos;s lots of game , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not going to be able to get a world community &apos;s community to support not just the defen@@ sors , but also the whole world , you don &apos;t have .
And I &apos;m always saying that the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a speaker , but I &apos;m going to do it in the first time , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m going to do it really ? &quot; &quot; Well first you &apos;ll say you know what you can do , and secondly , let &apos;s just let you know what you can do . And secondly , let &apos;s just let you know what you can do . &quot; &quot; And secondly , I &apos;ll let you know what you can do
I was a four-@@ year story when I met him . N@@ ec@@ ked a Cam@@ p in the prov@@ ince of K@@ and@@ al &apos;s prov@@ in@@ tel , but as it was born in the midst of the British ent@@ ries of K@@ and@@ al . But as it was born in the midst of the British , everybody had a lot of gratitude , even the one that could get to go and come out of the re@@ script .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s a re@@ pri@@ x@@ ment . And for the time I work on it , it started to grow , which is what we also know ?
What was it was to pass the first steps , and the second and then the third and then , and then , a lot of it , and then , a lot of things , I think , was going to be able to make my head to be able to get our heads through .
So , of course , I never had to go to the whole world , but he was trying to visit the entire world to the entire world , and by getting it , he grabs his fingers through the way .
Or if you were dark , it was like iron on the street and pass its fingers through .
And most of the men in the prison claim that it was his greatest le@@ di@@ de@@ ment and his sun and that always the e@@ dd@@ est , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m working so excited . A dog dog .
I &apos;m in a nonprofit accident without nothing , but a sense of his own journey , but a sense of his own journey , I think , in my opinion , I think we &apos;re going to be wrong . And I said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have to do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the one thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so why I thank you for the proph@@ est , des@@ ading the global imagination to imagine the cybercriminals , and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .

Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Let &apos;s take a talk to a th@@ ack@@ hear@@ t-@@ a tu@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Story@@ king a story . &quot; &quot; &quot; Story@@ king a story . &quot;
&quot; &quot; She &apos;s a secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; I was a inspired by a inspired by the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not like it &apos;s just thinking of a TED .
In fact , if you &apos;re so much of these , you &apos;re too much , it looks too much clip , it looks like a laser , or an emotional emotional emotional .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because I &apos;ve been several hundred of TED emails , like these .
I was told that the secrets of a great talk , and I learned directly directly from them the secrets of a great talk .
And even though these actors and their subjects look completely different , they all have a common ground .
And this : The main task is to transfer the mind of who who &apos;s to transfer the mind extraordinary , a beautiful object , beautiful object we call it .
Let me explain it .
This is H@@ ey .
He &apos;s a point of giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s landing .
( Video ) ( Video ) Com@@ der Coop@@ er : Hy@@ dy Van D@@ ey@@ ck !
( Applause ) 1 200 people , a lot of which never come to be before they were before their brains are actually going to be able to synchronize their brains with their brains .
They literally start ex@@ hi@@ ding the same pattern of brain neurons .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they are feeling the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to take a look at the brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain .
There &apos;s millions of neurons connected in a le@@ monade .
But here &apos;s a few billion are connected to each other a way that represents a simple idea .
inside the entire audience of the audience .
This is just a couple of minutes , a pattern that &apos;s millions of neurons of electronic neurons to 0.@@ 2 to one 200 heads , only with people listening to a voice and look at a face .
But I hope , is a sense of what it is ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern of information that helps understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from a lot of forms and soft , from complex and analy@@ sts , and we are able to figure out .
So here &apos;s a couple of examples of co-@@ parties since the TED stage .
Sir , by ta@@ sty Bhu@@ n@@ son , the creativity of our kids .

CA : Ch@@ im@@ gu@@ e A@@ di@@ chi@@ e people are more than one identity .
Video ) Ch@@ im@@ gu@@ e A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that for false , that &apos;s true .
CA : So your mind opens up ideas , and you don &apos;t do it .
They are cared for as long as we are connected .
Govern@@ ally , it &apos;s an incredible incredible structure that &apos;s about our world personal personal view .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like you &apos;re sailing to the world .
And then you &apos;ll add millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a small subset of the world is the idea that the sound that the sound loved , then the green , the way , the way , the way .
But if another Mexican in the world look the idea that the leop@@ ards are dangerous , then the idea that the leop@@ ards of a little bit different .
So it &apos;s pretty obvious that the ideas that are going to look at the world look crucial .
You need to be the most significant thing that you can possibly be possible , a self for the fear , but wonderful world world .
Now , the different people in the world are actually very different .
For example , how is it wrong to your world look at this picture : ( Video ) D@@ alia Mo@@ ga@@ hed : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; One woman &apos;s wife &quot; &quot; an expert , even &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; ?
Or , &quot; &quot; I think of &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CA : Don &apos;t tell you , you &apos;re the answer , there &apos;s millions of people out there who are going to be different differently .
If you communicate in a way , you &apos;re able to change it , always , so the way you see the world and turn its own way so far as the world is .
The ideas are the most powerful force that we make human culture .
So if you accept that your main task as a conservative person is building a sense in your mind in your audience , here are four papers of your audience , and you &apos;re going to take some extra care of your talk : First , just your talk to your talk .
The ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce the content to make sure that I &apos;ll actually have to reduce the content to make sure that I love you , and have the chance of explaining it .
You &apos;ll make context , sharing examples , doing that real .
So I pasted a picture and tell you that it &apos;s a thread that &apos;s going to be a whole talk , so everything you want to connect you in a way .
And secondly , it turns out that people will listen to you .
Before we start building things in the mind of your audience , you have to have their permission to get it to get .
What is the tool to do this ?
Curiosity .
I &apos;ve lost curiosity from curiosity to your audience .
Use questions intrigued , and it &apos;s been a ca@@ sual , causing that something doesn &apos;t have a sense and accurate .
If you can reveal a disconnect in the view of somebody &apos;s view , they feel they will need to cover that knowledge of knowledge .
And when I &apos;m that wish is much easier to start building the idea .
Third , you can and your idea , piece of conception that your audience is known .
It &apos;s using language power to make a lot together , and we &apos;ve been thinking there &apos;s a mind of who who are listening but not in your language , in your language .
It started where they are .
The actors often forgotten that many terms of terms that many terms of terms and conception of what they live are completely quiet for their audiences .
Well , the metaph@@ orical representations of a crucial to show how they fit the tor@@ ment , because they reveal the way that they &apos;re expected to be expected , based on a thought that who hears it .
For example , when Jennifer invited me to explain the incredible new bio@@ ograp@@ hies called CRISPR , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you had a computer process of text .
The British Age allows you to cut and take genetic information very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic event like this leads to a great moment of awe during our mind .
It &apos;s important , so by so , to try to talk to the talk of trust , and see that parts are most conf@@ uses .
Cu@@ ding . Here &apos;s the final thing : it &apos;s going to be the ultimate ending ideas .
So this is this question that makes you think of this question , who are actually sharing this idea ?
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea only gives you to you and your organization , then I feel , probably not deser@@ tifying unless it &apos;s worth a shared .
The audience will move through you .
But if you make the idea of lighting &apos;s ability to get the day somebody &apos;s or to change someone &apos;s perspective to someone &apos;s perspective , or inspire somebody to do things else , it &apos;s the essential essential to a good talk of truth , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
We only have one 25 percent of what we &apos;ve heard .
I promise you would probably not tell you that I would want to listen to every day I would never forget that would you would ever want to hear every day I would ever let it .

A world where we &apos;re not listening to each other &apos;s other people &apos;s other other than each other &apos;s other people &apos;s other way we &apos;re not listening to each other &apos;s other other than each other .
To re@@ submit the ear and put the ear listening to the ear and put your ear listened to the ear , to re@@ submit the ear and put the ear .
It &apos;s to appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my se@@ a@@ ite .
We see that ordinary sounds like ordinary people can be very interesting if we take attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine you &apos;re a little bit of a anywhere in the street , and you find a guy &apos;s name , and you say , &quot; &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Per@@ mate , this is the O@@ ak , this is the O@@ ak , that &apos;s the O@@ ak .
This is the 26 , 26 , that the 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , apples you don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , apples , are just soft . &quot; &quot; The Greeks is a little bit astonished , and it &apos;s a little bit astonished , and it &apos;s ra@@ gged and un@@ mista@@ k@@ op@@ d@@ rous .
Now , imagine you &apos;re a ring of your corpus of Japan , Mi@@ ming the person you have on the side and ask questions , &quot; Per@@ mate , how do you call this street ? &quot;
They &apos;re okay , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the 17 and that the 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
apples .
Meet Google &apos;s right here . There &apos;s the 14 , 15 , 18 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 , 19 ,
All of those apples have names , and the streets are just the low-@@ name with the apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know your credit for your house ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is 8 .
Mos@@ tly 17 : A number . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Okay . But I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; &quot; Okay . But I walk through the slide I watched the road , &quot; &quot; El a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; ) M@@ ag@@ o : &quot; &quot; of course . They &apos;re going to be built in the order of the act in the way they were built .
The first house built on an apple is the number one .
The second house you built is the house number two .
The third is the big number : it &apos;s easy . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know how sometimes we have to go on the other side of the world to give us the things un@@ consciously , and allow us to rethink that the opposite of them can be true .
As an example , there &apos;s been in China that you believe their work is hold .
So every month you &apos;re healthy to pay you , and when you &apos;re sick , you don &apos;t know why they &apos;re missing the work of your work . See your eyes when you &apos;re healthy , I don &apos;t know .
( Applause ) We think of the music that &apos;s strong , the beginning of music &apos;s strong speech . One , two , three , three , four .
But in the music music music , a &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; is a
So , you can listen to listen to not just the translator &apos;s mind , but in the way , three , three , one .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that it &apos;s given that for any true thing that I think about India , the next will also be true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so much at TED as another place , that &apos;s a lot of fun , that for any brilliant idea that we had to let us know , the wrong way they would be true .
Be a de@@ mi@@ sm , they act as un@@ used .
