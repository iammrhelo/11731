( Arabic ) I think I think I think I think we should be in A@@ at@@ an@@ an@@ a@@ ose , but they &apos;re not saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; No .
( Laughter ) I was on a medium of media class .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but when I was born , he was a business of business .
If their children were children or girls , if their children were boys or girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls
So I suppose I was lucky .
My mother was 17 times .
Of the 16 , we &apos;re alive .
You can imagine what I had to happen when I was girl .
I mean , I watched women as being transported to the orphan@@ age , or children being brought in .
At that moment , when I finished high school , I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I want to take my education , but I would rather wait to college .
Bri@@ lli@@ ant in my country , there was no shortage of women in the denial , so even though I accept the medicine of medicine , I couldn &apos;t .
As a result , my dad sent America .
You see in America .
I strapped my studies .
As I ended up finishing my education , I Rus@@ ked my country .
You know ? When I was finishing my training , strangers was what was happening to my family and my country .
I had months , and I didn &apos;t have bad news .
My family found was a refugee camp camp .
So instead I finished the research , brought my family to America .
They wanted to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I listened to the news , when I was going to see the news that was going to happen in my country , I &apos;ll tell you the heart .
I would rather go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t afford because there was no place to me .
I had a good job .
It was teachers at a university .
It was good .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my focus .
So I went back to the camp .
And when I arrived at the field of Tide , I was seven million and a half million half-@@ year .
They were in the 90 percent of the 90 percent women and children , and most of men or died in the war or were on it .
when I was doing the most , when I was doing the most , when I was doing the things that I don &apos;t think about .

You see a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , without education , not a place , not a place where to live .
In the kids who are lost their parents , their partners and who were 10 or sweet , they had to climb their family , to be the head of family and try to protect their harm , their mothers and children .
So the situation was absolutely lo@@ gue .
My heart , my heart , and didn &apos;t know what to do .
At that moment , there &apos;s a little impulse .
At that moment , I felt like I could do by these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m a person like I can do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
It turned out he . They put it in a position .
He gave me confidence . I had a career .
We took my family to another country , bringing my family to another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country ,
And I &apos;m sure what he was supposed to provide my people was education and health , and that was what I tried to do .
But think was easy ?
Because not , that women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Furthermore , after the sixth of Rus@@ hom@@ ore in Afghanistan , people didn &apos;t trust .
It was very hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this .
It turns out the United States .
So when you educate here .
They don &apos;t want me ? We don &apos;t .
So what really needed was un@@ warran@@ ted to trust this community .
How are I going to do it ?
I went back , I came up and watched .
I did ask questions .
And finally , I found a man .
It was 80 years old .
It was a cold .
I went to her room in the ground , and he said , &quot; &quot; I want you to have a teacher .
And I looked at it , and he said , &quot; &quot; T@@ la , what do I think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be a teacher . &quot; &quot; And finally , he accepted me , and I hope I started with a kind of one , and I hope I started with a kind of thing that I can be a kid in his son , she &apos;s going to the voice .
As a year of a year , we had 25 schools , 15,000 kids to school , and was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
We were supposed to do our work , and we were doing our work , forming teachers , in the Philippines , humans , democracy and laws .
One day , I was sitting in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , and I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , and I was in the workshop .
( Laughter ) And then , then I saw myself , and suddenly I saw my graduate staff went to the Fourth of my childhood , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Fu@@ ch@@ ate ! &quot; &quot; And I said , as a leader , who do it ?
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know , your life is in play .
But as a leader , you have to keep your compositions .
You have to maintain the posture and display it .
So I wonder , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And those people are raised in mass of my workshop .
So I invited them into the office .
They came up , and nine , nine , nine .
The most grim men that you can see is never .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s another way to do with that , and it &apos;s going to make it wrong , and they &apos;ll go into mass mass in my workshop .
And she invited me to seat and take one .
And then they weren &apos;t going to take .
And of course , the voice of voice that they used to be really afraid , and I was really struck .
But at the same time , I kept smiling .
And of course , I &apos;m like , you see it as a little bit like my head .
The only thing if I saw the eyes , the only one if I saw my eyes .
I wondered , what do we do ?
&quot; You don &apos;t know what the school would be supposed to be in the female ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I went to the face and said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s the house of somebody .
I &apos;ll meet some students . They all learned the holy book , the holy book .
You know ? What if you study the holy book , women can be good , and they can obe@@ y their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , that &apos;s how it &apos;s about that people . ( Laughter ) At that moment , I had been talking to you .
They talked to them , and they said , &quot; &quot; We are , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to do it again . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to have one another time . &quot;
So my personal age raised in mass adoption .
They were killed of fear .
Don &apos;t afford to kill me .
Don &apos;t tell me they didn &apos;t carry me out .
With all , all of you were all giant worm .
So I &apos;m happy , and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Sure , I &apos;m going to be alive .
But also , by the way , when the Taliban faced the Taliban , when the Taliban had power was another story .
We &apos;ve made it up in the branches and we teach we have the 18@@ ,000 , three students of scaffolding , who we &apos;re working with no Ces@@ ar .
We went to the Taliban in the Taliban , we went to the country and open a school after another .
We open centers of education .
We opened clinics without stop .
We worked with women and children .
We care about productive health .
We can imagine how many types of technologies can imagine .
I was very happy , and I was really happy . I was love .
And one day , when I was about four educators , and with one another , to the north of the day , once again , we used to be used in the street of the road , by doing 19 kids .
On the way back to the ground , they block the road .
I asked her to my driver and reply , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; You may have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What the hell ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; they said nothing and they have .
At that time , women sold in the car .
I &apos;m so affected , and I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
So this time , we &apos;re going to kill everybody .
No doubt .
But still , when the moment comes , then the forces of everything that you see and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You know , you know , you can follow that .
So I supported on one side of the car .
My leg rose and out of the car .
I ask them , &quot; &quot; How can I help them ? &quot; &quot; You know what I would help them ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
It matches every day in a place .
Teaching women , they are also giving them the chance to have a job .
Do you want to go . What do you look like ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
What we know , the only one we can do , for time , is evidence of a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know anymore .
Obviously , it was a dirty .
So I came back and said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I went back and said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I went back and said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I went back and said , &quot; &quot; No , we love women .
We just had money to teach them to them , to send them to the school , and nothing else .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all of the very big educators .
They go to their home . No one .
My mother was the only one he was there , and I had no voice .
So I was beautiful , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot;
Because we offer education in the north .
The women came up to think of it .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly we are talking about pulses , because we &apos;re now talking about pulses , because I &apos;m a moment , one of my sketches before he asked me .
( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Sha@@ k@@ na ? &quot; &quot; And I answered .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I was trained .
It was the same thing that I was told , I don &apos;t tell me .
&quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s going .
I told I all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next one , you go and give them them .
He said , two days later , later , I &apos;ve done the same way , you know , the same way , you know , they weren &apos;t there , they were just a little further away , the same kids , and we can stop the car .
So I stopped the car .
I went and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , come to me . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No .
So I brought my mosque to the mosque , and to sum up , I told them I was going to have teachers .
Now , they are the best educators .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , learn computer and sound sound .
The whole areas that we don &apos;t , in the mountain zones , they come with me . They go and go .
And trust us .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That makes education change people .
When I educate people , they and we , we need to work as equality .
You can &apos;t educate the women and forget of men , because men are the people who get it more difficult to women .
( Laughter ) So we started pasting them , because they have to be conscious of the ability of women , knowing how much that &apos;s going to have the men , and that women can break the same ones that they have .
So we form men continuously , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think
I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
So I want to share this .
It was a beautiful , beautiful country , beautiful .
We take all the parts .
Women were paid education : angry , engineers , teachers — and we went home to another .
We don &apos;t apply the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of security problems .
But we don &apos;t want to be a win .
And I want to get another part .
Now the women of Afghanistan are very , very hard .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) Thank you . Be angry .
They studied to be doctors , again .
They studied to be creative and run business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use their whole capacity and all this will happen .
I want to share with you by love , by compassion , by trust and honesty .
If you have these things , you succeed .
We have a poet , Ma@@ w@@ a@@ us R@@ it@@ <unk> .
He said that if you have compassion and if you have love , it can make the world .
And I said , we were able .
And if we were in Ghana , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that anybody can get all around the world .
Thank you , thank you so much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
There &apos;s 10 years ago , a phone called my life .
So I was a cardio@@ logist at UC@@ LA to California , Los Angeles of California .
It was inspired me was a Som@@ ali Ze@@ o Ze@@ it@@ et .
One old chimps are expected to judge the facial expression and the veter@@ ury of it to be a stroke .
You may ask me if you could go to the zoo to search a heart cause .
It will leave clear that the United States in the United States with which the United States has been driven and highly ratings that take care of their patients .
But sometimes , you &apos;ll be able to make a medical community , especially for some particular medical curriculum , but sometimes you want to make a difference , and sometimes it &apos;s going to be able to make a better health community , especially for some new medical services .
They managed to download the brain to brain brain imaging in the case of this chimpanzees , and then I watched the sil@@ houette of this le@@ elly for a possible suit , and then I watched the sil@@ ker of this le@@ elly piece was no inflammation .

And this one thing is , I &apos;ve already been in many human patients , and it &apos;s an identical , with the exception of that bar@@ p and that glue .
leading symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients , and for their animals .
And when instead , the same day was going to happen at UC@@ LA Medical Center at UC@@ LA Medical Center .
And I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing .
So basically , doctors and regulators were the same disease , basically , doctors and activists have the same diseases in their human patients in their human patients , and animals : in@@ numer@@ able heart disease , diabetes , ar@@ thri@@ tis , ar@@ thri@@ tis , and aspir@@ ation .
Well , I have to do with a tor@@ ment .
I think I &apos;ve studied physiology and biology biology during college — even I &apos;ve been doing my activation thesis about Darwin &apos;s Dise@@ ases of Darwin — learn more about the meaningful outbreak among the disease and human rights was a very necessary game for me .
And I started asking myself how I could be , with all these coinci@@ dences , who would never get confused and feel a veter@@ in@@ arian or ir@@ tri@@ pling , to have another version of one of my patients ?
Would we have never met a Would we do it ?
Even more , why should surprise you ?
All doctors accept so some connections between animals and humans .
And all the drugs that we prescribe , that we take or we give our families in an animal .
But there &apos;s a great difference between giving an animal a drug or innov@@ ator or innov@@ ating a human disease , and that animal develops itself by themselves in@@ kable , diabetes or cancer cancer .
Maybe , part of the <unk> <unk> of the world has increased between the urban and the water .
We listen to the United States and we &apos;re trying to talk about the world &apos;s trees or that the air comes from a plant .
The human hospitals of today are going to turn every time in profit of technology .
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients that are there and the animal patients who live in the ocean , on the length and in the jun@@ ks .
But I think there &apos;s still a deeper reason :
For the doctors and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists have accepted intellec@@ tually , the Neanderthals and scientists , and scientists , and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and
But in our indoors we don &apos;t end up .
I &apos;m interested in me when I go to Mozart or I see my Mozart or I see the Mar@@ ms R@@ ape .
I feel that called the human human fact , but identifying the cost of human human life as a single one of them , the part .
Well , yeah , I am trying .
Now , when I see a human patient , I always wonder : what know the doctors of animals about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
Why could I make better my human patient look like a human animal ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the suggestion of connections that gave me this kind of reason .
Shar@@ ing heart heart disease .
So there &apos;s a year 2000 , the drug deal@@ ers , they found &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; discovered &quot;
It was a Marine at the forefront of the game that lost the savings savings in a part of life in a part of a land@@ drop .
But it turns out that this &quot; &quot; new diagnosis &quot; &quot; is not new .
The veter@@ in@@ ans were used to be diagnosed by trying , trying and even pre@@ proper symptoms in animals , from monkeys , and even surprisingly emotional symptoms , from the 1930s .
How many of the human lives could actually save if this robotic knowledge is reduced to the Neanderthals of the doctor &apos;s doctor ?
T@@ ol@@ sion .
Some patients humans would kill themselves .
You have to be .
Some patients also are also self-@@ man@@ rent .
There are so@@ ites that are cold and over again .
But the rest of us have very specific shapes have very specific ways of treating and value , and yet we adapt to the animals that behave like this .
It shouldn &apos;t be this awareness by the Neanderthals of psycho@@ therap@@ ists , &apos; parents and the patients who are fighting the hall@@ marks ?
It &apos;s providing pressure and psychotic .
Sometimes the little bit about giving light in depression , sometimes in severe depression , and still in psychotic states .
They can reject their own child , and in cases , they get to the man@@ ta .
The govern@@ ors of casset@@ tes know also that when instead of being a little bit after the age , it can reject its flesh , and den@@ ying it , and in some cases , lets it up to ma@@ dge .
But the veter@@ in@@ ators have a treatment to address this syndrome disorder that allows us to increase oxytocin from the down@@ side .
Ox@@ oxytocin is the hormone hormone , and it turns out that the water has a ren@@ amed .
Wouldn &apos;t it be this information to the Neanderthals and the Neanderthals , &apos; doctors , family physicians and the patients who are faced with the deb@@ tors and the doctor who faced them ?
Despite the fact that it &apos;s all about it , the distance between our all the time is large .
To explain it , a lot of me fear , what I &apos;m going to have to put some of some of them in action .
There are doctors who can be authentic with the Neanderthals that are not drivers in medicine .
I mean , the dentist , and psychologists , and psychologists , but especially participants .
Of course , most doctors have no idea that it &apos;s harder to get in days in a College of V@@ ants than in a field of medicine , and when we go to medicine we learn everything that &apos;s relevant to you about a species , the Neanderthals , but the rest of the learning of learning about health and fish .
So I don &apos;t blame for veter@@ in@@ ers by sent@@ enced to exc@@ esses and viol@@ ating my fellow teens .
So here &apos;s a part of the human part of the human world : how do you call a veter@@ in@@ ury that just knows a species ?
Doctor graphy &apos;s going to get away from my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through programs like Darwin on UC@@ L@@ E in UC@@ L@@ R , in UC@@ L@@ L@@ en that we are using the experts in animals and biologists to engage our medical student of our lives and residents .
And through the genome of Ze@@ alization , we invited us to Education of Medicine and V@@ i@@ tion@@ als to keep educated about the disease and the commands of V@@ i@@ tion@@ -like patients by humans .
And in the world with Ze@@ ama@@ lia the participants are supposed to learn how the treatment of a tiger can be used to better treat the cancer of an infant , and how we understand the minority policy of a brand of child mortality ; how do we understand the political definition of a cow from a child &apos;s child &apos;s face , and how better understand the treatment of the anxiety of a child &apos;s license to be faced by the early ones .
In the world , Ze@@ ster@@ ani , first in America , and now all over the world , doctors and activists leave their own and si@@ mmed and collecting as a child like mine .
In the end , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s time for us to doctors , doctors , and we could allow us to make sure that we are doctors , and we can connect to veter@@ inary teach@@ ings on a health that ranges all species .
Because it turns out that some of the best episodes and humani@@ sts are being restricted by magnets that are not humans .
And one of the best ways of treating the human patient is appropriate to ask a lot of attention to how everybody &apos;s other patients on the planet , and they grow , and then they go .
Thank you very much .

It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here the key word is &quot; &quot; it was &quot; &quot; was .

Life , a complex human being , is by medical data : the Neanderthals , the medical test , the Internet results ...
Suddenly make a test in a disease with legs .
Doctors are starting to talk a symptom that you don &apos;t understand .
And then he lets the joy of the finger your body and your heart .
People starts to change also because they begin to deal with Parkinson &apos;s disease instead of a person .
You ask , &quot; &quot; What would you tell you about the doctor ? &quot; &quot; No before I say &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as I say , I think so much , I think , I think so much .
ask the guy who — who ?
Are you who to study ? Would love love ?
Ask yourself , &quot; &quot; What did I do to do to deserve this to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; And they asked me , &quot; &quot; Can you change something in my life ? &quot;
Are there any other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the genius of all these cases , because they &apos;re very un@@ comprom@@ ised and comprom@@ ised .
But they &apos;re also very used to treat patients , so I would say that sometimes they lose the picture of that to you , and that &apos;s literally a little bit of a patient . &quot; &quot; Re@@ conscious means &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; meaning .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is , it &apos;s going to avoid any way to know your situation , to make your relationship to your family and friends or to teach your lifestyle to the risks of what you &apos;re doing .
But with all , thank you , thank you to take your hands from a couple of different memories .
As I was in the hospital , I asked myself , &quot; I mean , what I &apos;d like to do is tell me the joy of my dog .
It was very hard to get it , because it &apos;s not very common to ask a photo of your own .
I talked to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t tell me .
I &apos;m more like this .
The cure , whatever it is , has to face all of my own self . &quot; &quot; So the next day went back from the hospital to recommend@@ ation of a doctor .
And I was able to change my relationship to my relationship , and I was making a lot more about him before to do something as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several types of technologies , open and open my work .
So my very big bet was just taken off the information , and it &apos;s just information , and it &apos;s just a way to give it .
So I &apos;ve created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which , I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which , I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which , I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ u ,
As I had to get rid of them , but that &apos;s why we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So I picked this word , &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ ma , &quot; &quot; because in Spanish means &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding
In our Western culture means to eradicate or to go back to the disease , but in other cultures , as an example of Asia , from the nor@@ thwestern Mediterranean , it can represent a lot of other things .
So of course , I became interested in the opinion of doctors and the rest of the health , but I was also interested in the summit for the performer for the poet , by the poet , by designing , or why not , by musicians .
I was interested in the social quality , I was interested in the psychological condition , I was interested in the psychological condition , I was interested in the spirit of the greatest record .
And it worked .
The site developed &quot; &quot; La Ch@@ u &quot; &quot; around the world .
I &apos;ve heard a lot of med@@ anity from Italy and the foreign 50,000 of 50,000 people in touch with me in a very little while through social media , social media , social media , and most of them were providing opportunities for how to heal me as a person .
For example , you &apos;ve created thousands of videos videos , images , photos and represent art to La C@@ op@@ k .
So here &apos;s the example of Franc@@ o Magazine and his act .
Or what did the artist did , frankly , L@@ ich@@ ty : So , or a sculpture of my tumor , I can &apos;t do it as well .
Now you can see my dog !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something great , you can share the same .
And this was what I was going to happen : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors ... all were connected to me .
Given all of this information and support , I became able to put together a brain team of swollen brain , physicians , onco@@ logists and many hundreds of volunteers I could talk to talk about the data that I was going to talk about , which is really important .
People are able to formul@@ ate a different strategy from my own different languages and as different crops .
So the strategy was going to under@@ cut the entire world , and thousands of years of human history , something that I found quite nicely .
( Music )
So I could take my time to choose .
I picked up the doctor I wanted to work on , I chose the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the time thousands of people were supporting me to feel sorry for me .
All the world would feel that should be stopped by helping me , and this was the most important part of the C@@ Ds .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;m great news after that surgery : I have — I mean , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s a very low link , which is a kind of thing that don &apos;t make a lot .
I was fully my life and my life lifestyle .
It was very intense , and it was very intense , and it was very intense , and had a network map of the connected to my brain on this side , to make a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before we were , we were able to analyze this map with a physician to understand the risks I would run , and if there was one thing I would like to avoid .
Obviously , they are .
This glim@@ mers was the true key to La C@@ op@@ k .
Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
The doctors came to talk to people out that they typically didn &apos;t look at it when it comes from .
I came up with myself , I &apos;m in a continuous state of translation among many different languages , where the science is found with the Neanderthals and the traditional research .
( Music ) &#91; SO@@ LE@@ X &#93; ( Music ) The key to La Ch@@ anc@@ an is the key part of a truly significant society , and connected , cur@@ ing global well-being is from each one of their individuals .
This world world is my source .

I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I don &apos;t tell you what it is .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be something of music .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what we &apos;re listening to .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before you were , before anything , we stole your life to the trunk of your entire life , ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Tra@@ vis Tra@@ vis down on the bottom , ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause
The choreograp@@ h , as we call it , is a remarkable space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that makes him holy is not the chance of thinking about the future , or in the past .
We live in this moment .
You have to take a lot of decisions when one goes to the choreograp@@ me .
We had no idea what we were going to touch .
So a half of a song called &quot; &quot; The B@@ loom . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
Everybody heard . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for practical ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a baseball player , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
The way I &apos;m good for a mistake when I &apos;m in the choreograp@@ me — before anything , you don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake to peace in that is not that it &apos;s the other thing .
Each mistake is an opportunity .
Even it &apos;s hard to do what it would be fun .
For example , if you &apos;re a color , as if you &apos;re going to get a little bit like this ...
( Music ) ( Music ) If you reach a note — like F@@ old .
See it all fits in your body .
If it touches M@@ i .
You see , all of you , all of the interior of this particular emotional charge that we &apos;re painting .
And yet , if we touch the # tom@@ y@@ ron , most of you have a mistake of a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this .
At some point , they &apos;ll add to this bill .
And we &apos;re not going to change it .
It has to play for a second , and then let me stop and talk a moment .
We &apos;re going to see it &apos;s what happens when we touch it .
( Music ) ( Music ) Now , if you don &apos;t , somebody might suggest that as a mistake .
I would just guess it &apos;s a mistake about a mistake if we don &apos;t adverti@@ se against it .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;re going to paint this way again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to push it , but something else will change .
We &apos;re going to make their ideas , or not .

And I created a melody .
This time the texture changed the way .
It was a little sexi@@ er , a little more in my response .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if it &apos;s not conscious , if every musician is not conscious , and they don &apos;t recognize their partners to engage the idea and we don &apos;t allow their creativity .
This rose is truly incredible .
It &apos;s an puri@@ fying experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking about everyone when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that being able to climb the choreograp@@ h and make music is a blessing .
What do you have to do this ?
We are all musicians of <unk> , our stereotyp@@ o is not the most right thing to do .
( Laughter ) So I just wanted to show you how to do it .
And the other one is that we don &apos;t make any micro@@ be in the way .
There are people who do it .
But that includes the art choice .
If it tells you to the band that touched me , I want you to dream and do it , and I &apos;m going to tell you .
It turns out , something .
One , two , two , three , three , four .

Tell me , &quot; &quot; A@@ tie me on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It &apos;s more than to see what I can perceive as what I can do .
If I want music music from a certain level , the first step to me is being patient , listen , it &apos;s going to be patient , listen to what happens to me .
When you do , motivated and inspire to the other musicians and they dance more , and that &apos;s going to do it .
One , two , two , three , three , four .

It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more berries .
It &apos;s not about spreading my vision .
We &apos;re going to be at the moment when we accept one another and let them move to creativity .
Thank you .

He wrote this to his love .
I &apos;m going to be s@@ inc@@ ere , so much of these incredible talks and ideas that are being exposed to , inv@@ athetic in the early 70s of climbing up here the television player .
Everybody sees television .
I like them . I love us some things .
Here in America people .
The average person watching television is almost five hours a day .
Right ?
He &apos;s alive , I live in television , so I think it &apos;s beautiful .
But people don &apos;t like it .
They were , of course , un@@ used crops .
It &apos;s useless , and things are useless .
My mother , when I was a girl , she &apos;d call it &quot; &quot; the silver box . &quot; &quot; My intention today isn &apos;t de@@ bed if there &apos;s a good television or television television , my view today is telling me that the television must be conscious .
If I think that television has consciousness is because I think that television reflects directly to moral policy , social and emotional policy has been made of all of our spacecraft as we &apos;re producing all of our values .
All of that is intrinsic to humans , and it gave our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk today or bad .
We talk about popular television .
We talk about 10 programs of audience during a 50-@@ year period .
Like that index doesn &apos;t just happen when you hear it , which is the notion of our social unconscious and collective unconscious , if you don &apos;t , like those 10 programs for decades reflecting the idea of our social consciousness ?
How can we evolve the television over time , and that tells our society our society ?
By leveraging the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , if you take away that the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the human kingdom , has four basic neurons .
They suffer , relationships , power , and the wish they can .
As humans , what you have to remember is that we evolved over time , evolved over time until we have mastered these basic animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel angry , compassion .
This isn &apos;t just in the animal kingdom .
The other thing drives human beings is that we love the fun .
I love to see television .
This is something that is happening in the animal world .
As you can play like you like to play , but you don &apos;t get to you .
So we figure out what it understands from this relationship of humans between the computer and the human consciousness .
Why is it wrong ?
The kid pointed out like his sketches , and the angel sitting in our shoulder .
So television does work like our consciousness , try us and do the same time ?
To start the challenge of these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
We projected 50 years to suffer 50 years ago .
We &apos;ve done the top 20 of the audience from the audience of the audience that &apos;s 50 years old — thousands of programs .
We talk about 3,000 people nearly 3@@ 600 , and we &apos;ve asked how to feel emotionally .
How did you feel you meet each one of these programs ?
Did you meet a moral deal ?
Did you feel clear ? Do you know ?
What meant for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean this was taken out in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of necessary age are universal .
And second the accomplishments , an 80 percent of the most popular programs in the U.S.
I wish for our political audiences to feel identified .
I want to breathe through the two people before I saw the first slide : &quot; &quot; Why would it really inspired me to think about it in the sense of consciousness and the presu@@ mption that consciousness can hold us on the day day , gave it through the legi@@ en@@ ca , Jack <unk> en .
And so in what I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to breathe thanks to the opening director director of Hans Rosling , who would come to see .
Well , let &apos;s go .
Here you see , since 1960 , since 1960 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to start the fact that we &apos;re going to start the state of account and the state of a moral age , which , to this study , define the way the computer programs that tells me how to make me feel better with the world .
A moral age is the programs that don &apos;t buy the difference between good and wrong .
By the beginning , you see that in 1960 , inspirational success .
So we see television .
A moral age starts to make it .
Pretty much at the end of 60 , the am@@ erec@@ orded moral age increases , and the inspirational bottom .
Why ?
The crisis of C@@ uba , the murder crisis and J@@ FC , the movement of the P@@ uba , the movement of the War on , the assass@@ ination of M@@ ouse , the assass@@ ination of M@@ am , the murder of M@@ art@@ ate Luther King and B@@ ob@@ by Kennedy , the Green Climate Institute .
Look what happens .
1970 condem@@ ning it .
A moral age dis@@ offer .
They put together , plus , a television director , is in control .
It &apos;s going to raise the flight .
But it doesn &apos;t , you can &apos;t do it , but it can &apos;t do it , but we &apos;re doing it , but we can &apos;t do it .
A moral acu@@ ity becomes the dominant rate of 1990 to the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This graph shows a similar trend .
But in this case , we have the happiness of the red carpet , and then we have the happiness in blue and green rever@@ tion .
At that time in television , we have &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy Gri@@ e , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy Gri@@ de , &quot; &quot; and the national revolution reflecting happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase , and happiness opens up everything .
It starts to rise .
It has to break the social burden increases .
We are exporting and what happens .
The happiness , the magic , and social social , not just fighting our society , but there are two programs , &quot; &quot; G@@ ap@@ ake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ost &quot; &quot; which in fact are number two and number three things in the rate .
What was the number one ?
( Laughter ) And the series of physicists and socially in@@ rever@@ ment , &quot; Roots and Martin &apos;s C@@ Ds &quot; &quot; Row .
They all live together .
The spec@@ t@@ Line was made .
Let &apos;s see this peak in 196@@ 6 with a password pain .
When you &apos;re listening to the term , success is successful , you mean ?
I mean , in 196@@ 6 , I mean her@@ ds of 196@@ 6 , as I am told .
So this was the first program that allow us to be honest , &quot; &quot; My god , I can comment what I think of the War am , about the president , through the television , through the television , through the television . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it means for an unprecedented precedent .
Well , the same thing is , the same as a look at what happens .
In the 1970s , the rand@@ o stopped .
We don &apos;t see television for fun .
( Laughter ) The social status and the so@@ cket are over the 70s .
Now this is this .
What was the same was the 70 ?
We have &quot; &quot; all in the family , &quot; &quot; San@@ ford and I am , and the main shows in the top 10 days — M@@ AS .
In the 50 years of television that we study , seven of the most un@@ documented programs in the Vietnam War are , five of the heel during the announced announced .
So just a generation , in 20 years , and we &apos;ve learned , if you &apos;re going to do it , television can do that ?
Could I feel that ?
Does change change ?
The audience so I knew , I want to tell you that the people of the digital didn &apos;t invent the problems .
Archie B@@ un@@ ker was thrown out of his pup@@ pet with the rest of us .
So this is another pie . With other different kinds of things : &quot; &quot; I would like and imagination , what are you going to be like , &quot; &quot; I wonder the real reality and &quot; &quot; it makes me better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the story of the current achievement of the achievement .
( Laughter ) You know , every time I was thinking about it and imagination will do it , and it goes out of a way .
We want to see programs about saving money and in the Neanderthals ?
It &apos;s not . We &apos;ve been trying to have the number of leader &quot; &quot; The Book of Organ@@ ic &quot; &quot; which was cataly@@ zed over 10 to 10 million dollars , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million of dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Book of Charlie . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s — another peak of the U.S.
What was there on those programs ?
G@@ ane and rich .
&quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No .
A huge increase of our national successes has been made of quick and tough .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
You &apos;re either not in my sandwich , I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard or read them about the fall of the herd and the us@@ er@@ ance of reality .
As we say it in this rose , X brand a place .
New York City , the decade of humor , it &apos;s like &quot; &quot; F@@ end@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But it is : X brand a place .
As 2001 , in September of 2001 , the mood of the judgment .
Why not ?
We had the Neanderthals in 2,000 cases by Cu@@ j@@ ma .
The Hallowe@@ en of bubbles .
It &apos;s September of September .
The anti@@ hy@@ grams are part of the social lexicon .
Take what happens with time .
In the course of the century , the advent of the del@@ usion .
What do people care about their television ?
I would think it &apos;s binding or des@@ ired .
Give me happiness , my world are still below .
Don &apos;t , they want to judge .
I can work outside the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin dance .
I can choose to choose the new triump@@ h . You &apos;re just left .
Have you ?
( Laughter ) So the radically different thing about this is that these programs , of pure fun , had been out there for 50 years — that was when I said , at the beginning ? See a basic instinct .
We are animals , we need our mothers .
There wasn &apos;t a piece of television without an im@@ ap@@ ent and dominant mother of television .
In the 1930s — ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) At the end of the summit : &quot; &quot; Take it in the relaxed , &quot; &quot; Le@@ bird , Be@@ autiful Be@@ autiful .

So all of you , women and men from TED@@ Women , the audience of TED@@ W@@ s , thank you by letting me think of the television of the television .
But I &apos;m also giving me to the organizers that if you stand up in the morning , to get the ideas in our screens on our daily lives .
Dan had his life on television , safe , but you like , but you like , through the social media , whether it &apos;s life , longevity or not .
So thank you very much .

So I got a Cam@@ p in a Cam@@ p , and I found a 12@@ -year-old child that went outside and when he launches their own .
And as I looked at the eyes of the way that we were hundreds of letters that had written in political prisoners , we never had a letter no letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t a 12@@ -year-old boy who made something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a politician .
It was a 12@@ -year-old eight-@@ year-old .
So what I realized was that wasn &apos;t just in Cam@@ bodi@@ a , but in the age of 1@@ 13 countries in the developing world that tortured the right to the right to one another and the right is not to be li@@ kable .
And what I found was that there was an incredible sense of opportunities for all of us as a community community in order to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
I often think of the way we think about it as a form of political policy or that it is reserved for only the Neanderthals , but in fact , 95 percent of adolescents are not in political prisoners .
They are for people who are in court fees in court fees , and unfortunately , we put it the way far cheaper than research is cheaper than having a car system , cheaper than having a child , cheaper than ever .
The day of this co@@ ats that you may be possible for us as a world community , if we take that decision , then we take that decision , put it in the way method method for our life , but this will have a little bit of three things .
First of all , the infrastructure of power and connection defenses scale .
The second is to make sure that there &apos;s a very high and systematic charge of accidents .
And the third is the commitment .
So the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we were allowed ?
Could we do something by those countries ?
And I founded the E@@ hy@@ des Bri@@ des that have a specific mission to end with the same way method and put together in practice of research , and put them in practice cases , and then put them on a very early stage on these countries , and in the courts .
And yet my first experiment came out of Cam@@ bodi@@ a and my first visit of my first visit to Cam@@ p , when I was , in Neanderthals , fewer than 10 inches from the country , because K@@ Mi@@ z kill everybody .
And even 20 years later , there were only 10 inches from the country , and so on , so as much as you &apos;re sitting in a trunk , you don &apos;t just get a child like 12 year-old boy , but you ask me , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re here for 10 years because my husband commit a hy@@ me , but you can &apos;t find it . &quot;
The first group of defenses brought together and I don &apos;t remember , as I laughed , I wonder , &quot; &quot; Well , what do we do to research ?
And the room was in silence , and finally , a woman stood up , &#91; name &#93; , &quot; &quot; he said &quot; &quot; my teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to do more than one percent of people , and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to do more than one of the other people , and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to do
And these defenses they had to suffer from value to decide who would start to defend and support between them to be able to put together in practice .
And I still remember the early cases where they came from , the top 25 together , she &apos;s and the rest of it , and they were supportive of the rest , and they were supportive of the same way the ones were saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do the same way we &apos;re going to have done . &quot; &quot; But one day came the case , and he was sitting outside of a house .
She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d seen it as a person going to come out , and what caused the young people in a matter of a matter , but the police came , and I got nothing on top .
For that then she was hooked . He had a hard hair . I had an abortion .
And when he took his case , he gave his case to me and said , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , there &apos;s no case in all sorts of things in your eyes , and it will be translated into freedom . &quot; &quot; And the defenses he started started taking cases over the course of Cam@@ p &apos;s story , and as a little bit as a little bit starting to change the course of Cam@@ p &apos;s story .
But Cam@@ it &apos;s not sounds .
He was thinking , so it &apos;s just a Cam@@ p ?
Or also other countries ?
But it turns out in so many countries — it turns out in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it turns
And in the Bur@@ und@@ i came up in a trunk , and he didn &apos;t have a 12@@ -year-old eight-@@ phone , but a eight-@@ year eight-@@ phone company .
Or a woman , paste on your baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I am , but I &apos;m about it , but I &apos;m about it , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I know , but I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I was accused .
And when I went with the CEO of the Mar@@ p@@ , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to let it make it in freedom .
A creator will let it loose on it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can &apos;t talk about it , but look at me , 80 % of the two thousands of people here are no disconnect . What can we do ?
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t just the media anymore , but it wasn &apos;t just the media .
For example , in Cam@@ bodi@@ a , what happened was that &#91; &quot; &quot; French &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; name &#93; it wasn &apos;t sounds but he had the 24 / 7 , and the same way , in China , always me , always me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the desert when we can put it . &quot;
We can &apos;t help the lack of resources , and we &apos;ve told you we can &apos;t help them to create a sense of resources , and then we put it together , &quot; &quot; But I want you to try to figure out what the needs of resources never was . &quot; &quot; And with this organization , I want you to think about the lack of resources .
So , the solution we found was the solution that we found was , and then , the solution .
And I said , &quot; &quot; But here are tens of millions of dollars , and I decided to put me with another group of Legos . What they told me was they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , now we don &apos;t have the streets in the streets , and the police is one of the main reasons why we had to do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there are tens of millions of millions of dollars in the development system .
What &apos;s going on is that ? &quot; &quot; Re@@ in@@ vi@@ me with the development agencies and they were operating , and the expectation , which result to be normal , instead of password .
He showed me also a manual who was done .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it .
They were perfectly formed .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a question . Before I &apos;ve all come to the R@@ ose , who &apos;s going to do with them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , I said , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ tu@@ ten@@ ans . &quot;
And so the key thing is not just a lot of them , but to find a way to make a way to make a practice in practice systematically , because they are the exception of the system for the people who are being killed .
And while I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; yeah , of course , it seems like if you could do it , but we can do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because there &apos;s something big .
And that &apos;s a lot of reason why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first of them is that people about the emergence of the world have the ability to create miracles with their commitment .
And it &apos;s not just In@@ no@@ de , of who I told you in C@@ im@@ ir@@ an , but also defenses all around the world are getting very key .
We have a program called Ma@@ k@@ Ma@@ ers , and we realized there were drowning , and we realized , how we can support them ?
It &apos;s only a contest in line where you are going to be five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to have some innovation , if you &apos;re going to have any innovation that &apos;s going to put in practice .
And there &apos;s 30 microns in Ma@@ k@@ ers around the world , from Italy , to South Li@@ ka , or the Republic of Congo , which with five billion dollars , by by texting , and any way that you find out .
And there &apos;s not only these Neanderthals , but there are also many people who understood that they are actually their contacts and how they can move them .
For example , in China , the laws of the laws that im@@ b@@ ates the cops and the cops are told the people already have punished .
And while I was sitting with one of our tweets , I said , &quot; &quot; And how can we spread it ? How can we allow us to do that ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And the four of the best schools in the Muslim world have opened themselves and came from the police commission@@
I talked about the fact that we need to form and support the defenses .
We need to make practice in practice in practice all the time .
But the third one , the most important point , is that we commit this .
And often people said me , &quot; &quot; Well this is very good , but it &apos;s too idealistic .
I would come back . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think of this point is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same outcome , because that &apos;s exactly the same outcome that used or for the people who have decided to finish with him or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who have decided to engage .
One of our favorite poems of the defenses , who are shared with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about value , friends , the way , the way it &apos;s going to be , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not clear , and there &apos;s a lot of game , and there &apos;s a lot of game , but in the background , you don &apos;t have it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m safe so if we can make it as a global community of research .
And I &apos;m always fun , because I know the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a speaker , but I &apos;m going to do it really ? &quot; &quot; Well , first you &apos;ll tell you , you know what you can do , and secondly , will let you know what you can do .
Vision was a four-@@ year story when I met him , and he was in a Cam@@ p in the prov@@ ince of K@@ and@@ al in the prov@@ ince of K@@ and@@ al . But as it was born in the morning , everybody had a lot of gratitude , even the rain , so it was the only one he could get in and come out of the repression .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s a recur@@ ring . And so when you consider it , it began to grow , which is what we also have ?
What was it was going to happen by the first re@@ tail , and the second and then the third one , and then , in the third , and then , a lot of it , moving my head into the power , through the third one , and then I pasted my body , because what he wanted to do was to make it the way it was going to make it .
And of course , I never had to go to the whole world , but if I was trying to visit the entire world , I was trying to visit the entire 15@@ 6 .
Or if they were dark , it was as iron on the street , and it took his fingers through it .
And most of the men in the prison claim that it was his greatest release and his sun and the sun and all the exc@@ bling , and I thought , well , here &apos;s physics .
I used to be on a ru@@ g@@ sen without nothing , no material material , but a sense of his own journey , I think we &apos;re going to be missing one . And I said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the one thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so why I thank you to have the defen@@ seless imagination to imagine a new world with all of us together , and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Let &apos;s take a talk to the TED Talks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Story@@ king a story . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; As a inspired by a inspired by the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not just how you think about TED .
In fact , if you use too much of these mechanisms , it looks like a laser clip or an emotional manipulated .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks in common , and I &apos;d like to share it with you , because I &apos;ve been several hundreds of fantastic actors , like these .
I was told that the secrets of a great talk , and I learned directly directly from them the secrets of a great talk .
And even though these actors and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common ground .
And this : The main task as a filmmaker is to transfer the mind of who who wants to listen to the mind extraordinary , and beautiful object that we call it .
Let me explain it .
This is Hy@@ y .
This is a point of giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s landing .

( Applause ) 1,@@ 200 people , many of which have never been seen before they were before their brains when their brains are synchron@@ izing with the brain &apos;s brain .
They literally just start labe@@ ling the same pattern .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they are feeling the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to take a look at the brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain .
There &apos;s millions of neurons involved in a le@@ monade .
But here &apos;s a few billion people are connected to each other a way that represents a simple idea .
inside the face of the entire audience .
So it &apos;s like , just a couple of minutes , a pattern that has millions of neurons of robotic neurons to one 200 heads , only with people listening to a voice and look at a face .
But I hope that &apos;s an idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern of information that helps understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from a lot of forms and soft , from the complex and analy@@ sts of the simple and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and
So here &apos;s a couple of examples of co-@@ parties since TED stage .
Sir Palin &apos;s key is the key of our future of our kids .
( Video ) Sir Sir Ri@@ elly : What I was trying to do now is that creativity now and we have the same status .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : E@@ SL Har@@ dy built with bamboo is beautiful .
( Video ) Ell@@ is Har@@ dy : It &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , we &apos;ll be elegant , we &apos;ll be elegant , we &apos;ll be strong , we will be elegant , we &apos;ll be strong , we &apos;ll be strong , we &apos;ll be elegant , we &apos;ll be strong , we &apos;ll be elegant , we &apos;ll be strong , we &apos;ll be elegant , we &apos;ll be strong , we &apos;ll be elegant , we &apos;ll be strong , we &apos;ll be elegant ,
CA : Ch@@ im@@ gu@@ el A@@ di@@ chi@@ e people are more than one identity .
( Laughter ) ( Music ) Ch@@ im@@ gu@@ e A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that it &apos;s fake .
CA : So your mind opens up ideas , and you don &apos;t fix it .
They are cared for connected .
Govern@@ ally , there &apos;s an incredible incredible structure that &apos;s your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like sailing to the world .
And it &apos;s about millions of individual ideas .
If you , for example , a small subset of the world in the world is the idea that sound loved , then , in the green , it &apos;s okay .
But if any of the other stages of the world &apos;s view is the idea that the leop@@ ards are dangerous , then , in the green this way , a little bit different .
So it &apos;s pretty obvious that the ideas that make your view of the world are crucial .
You need to be the most significant thing that you can possibly be as possible , and it &apos;s wonderful world a real world .
Now , the different people in the world can be very different .
For example , how is it wrong in the world where you see this picture : ( Video ) D@@ alia Mo@@ ga@@ hed : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman &apos;s wife , &quot; &quot; an expert , even &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; ?
Or , &quot; &quot; I guess &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; a terrorist ?
CA : Do you want the answer , there &apos;s millions of people out there who are going to be different differently .
If they communicate in a way , they &apos;re able to change it , to always change the way that somebody sees the world and transform their selves as much as in the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that we make human culture .
So if you accept that your main task as a storyteller is to build an idea in your own audience , here are four items to address that task : First , limiting your talk to a single idea .
The ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce the content to make sure that you &apos;re going to take the content to make sure that I love you , and have the chance of explaining it .
You have to make a context , sharing examples , doing that real .
So you take an idea , and you &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on your whole talk to your talk , so everything you want to invite you in a way .
And secondly , it turns out that people will listen to you .
Before we start building things in the mind of your audiences , you have to have their permission to get it into .
What is the tool to do this ?
Curiosity .
I shared curiosity from my audiences .
Use open-ended questions , which lead to identify why something has no sense and accurate .
If you can reveal a dis@@ connection in the view of somebody &apos;s view , they feel they will need to cover that knowledge of knowledge .
And when you dive into that wish is much easier to start building the idea .
Third , you can and your idea , piece of conception that your audience is known .
Use the power of language to make sure that there &apos;s a mind of who you are , but not in your language , in your language .
They start where they are .
The actors often forget that a lot of terms that many terms of terms and conception of what they live in are completely close to their audience .
Well , unlike a crucial thing to show you how you fit your tor@@ rent , because they &apos;re revealing the kind of pattern , it &apos;s based on a sense of pattern , based on an idea who wants to understand it .
For example , when Jennifer invited me to try to explain the incredible new biotech of this brain called CRISPR , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time you had a text message .
The GMT allows us to cut and take genetic information very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic understanding of how this offers a great moment of end@@ ment as it locks in our mind .
It &apos;s important , for so much , to try to talk to the talk of trust , and see that parts are most useless .
Gone . Here &apos;s going to be the end of the end : It makes the bra@@ ch@@ ideas deserve to be sharing .
So I mean , I mean , what do you think of this question ?
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea is only to benefit from you and your organization , then I &apos;m happy , probably not deser@@ tifying .
The audience will move through you .
But if you think that the idea has the ability to illumin@@ ate the day someone or to change the perspective of someone &apos;s perspective to better or inspire somebody to do things else else , then you have the implication for a good talk of truth , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
We only have a 25 percent of what we &apos;ve heard .
I promised him that I would never forget that I would want to listen to every day I would never forget .

A world where we &apos;re not listening to each other &apos;s other people &apos;s other way we &apos;re not listening to each other each other &apos;s other labs .
To re@@ submit the ear and put the ear listened to the ear , to re@@ submit the ear and put the ear .
It &apos;s to appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my se@@ ti@@ d .
We see that everyday sounds can be very interesting if we take attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine you &apos;re in a street of any place in America , and you find yourself a guy who &apos;s the name of this apple ?
And you say , &quot; &quot; Per@@ mate , this is the O@@ ak , this is the O@@ ak , that &apos;s the O@@ ak .
This is the 26 , 26 , that the 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , apples you don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , apples like that are just low-@@ name with the streets .
Now , imagine you &apos;re on a corpus of whatever of Japan , Mi@@ kers to the person who you have on the side and ask yourself , &quot; Per@@ mate , how do you call this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the American apple and the 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
apples .
Meet Google &apos;s right here . There are the 14 , 15 , 18 , 17 , 18 .
All of those apples have names , and the streets are just the lowest .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you meet your home ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is 8 .
M@@ age 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Okay . But I walk through the slide I looked at the street , &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Sure . They &apos;re going to be built on the package in the way they were built .
The first house built on an apple is house number one .
The second house you built is the house number two .
The third one is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; How often we have to go on the other side of the world to tell us that we are going to be the other side of the world to tell us that we are going to be true .
Like , for example , there &apos;s been in China that believe their work is hold .
So every month that you &apos;re going to pay for you , and when you get sick , you don &apos;t know why they &apos;re missing in your work . They &apos;re rich when you &apos;re healthy , I don &apos;t know .
( Applause ) We think of the music that &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of music sentence . One , two , three , four .
But in the music music of the West Africa , one is the end of the sentence , like the end of one .
So , you can listen to listen to not just telling yourself not just the way it &apos;s happening in the way , two , three , four , one .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that there &apos;s a claim that for any true thing that you say about India , the next will also be true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so much at TED as another place , that &apos;s in a place , that for any brilliant idea that it &apos;s given us to be true .
It discou@@ raged me un@@ insul@@ ous hair .
