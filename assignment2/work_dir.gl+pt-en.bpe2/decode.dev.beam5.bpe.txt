( Arabic ) I think I think I think I think we should be in A@@ at@@ an@@ an@@ a@@ ose , but they &apos;re not saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; No .
( Laughter ) I was on a medium of media class .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but when I was born , he was a business of business .
If their children were children or girls , if their children were boys or girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls , girls
So I suppose I was lucky .
My mother was 17 times .
Of the 16 , we &apos;re alive .
You can imagine what I had to happen when I was girl .
I mean , I watched women as being transported to the orphan@@ age , or children being brought in .
At that moment , when I finished high school , I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I want to take my education , but I would rather wait to college .
Bri@@ lli@@ ently , in my country , there was no drug for women in the denial of medicine , and even if they accepted me in the middle school classes , I couldn &apos;t .
As a result , my dad sent America .
You see in America .
I strapped my studies .
As I ended up finishing my education , I Rus@@ ked my country .
You know ? When I was finishing my training , strangers was what was happening to my family and my country .
I had months , and I didn &apos;t have bad news .
My family found was a refugee camp camp .
So instead I finished the research , brought my family to America .
They wanted to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I listened to the news , when I was going to see the news that was going to happen in my country , I &apos;ll tell you the heart .
I would rather go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t afford because there was no place to me .
I had a good job .
It was teachers at a university .
It was good .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my focus .
So I went back to the camp .
And when I arrived at the field of Italy , I had seven million and a half million half-@@ year .
They were in the 90 percent of the 90 percent women and children , and most of men or died in the war or were on it .
when I was doing the most , when I was doing the most , when I was doing the things that I don &apos;t think about .
You have a widow with between five and eight kids , sitting there , crying , crying , without knowing it .
You see a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , without education , not a place , not a place where to live .
In the kids who are lost their parents , their partners and who were 10 or sweet , they had to climb their family , to be the head of family and try to protect their harm , their mothers and children .
This was absolutely un@@ raged .
My heart , my heart , and didn &apos;t know what to do .
At that moment , there &apos;s a little impulse .
At that moment , I felt like I could do by these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m a person like I can do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
It turned out he . They put it in a position .
He gave me confidence . I had a career .
I forced me to take my family to another country , bringing my family to another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family another country , to make my family the other country , to make my
And at that moment I knew that what he was supposed to provide my people was education and health , and that was what I tried .
But think was easy ?
Because not , that women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Furthermore , after the sixth of Rus@@ hom@@ ore in Afghanistan , people didn &apos;t trust .
It was very hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this .
Somebody comes from the United States .
Some people who educate them .
They don &apos;t want me ? We don &apos;t .
So what really needed was it was win trust from this community .
How are I going to do it ?
I went back , I came up and watched .
I did ask questions .
And finally , I found a man .
It was 80 years old .
It was a cold .
I went to her room in the ground , and he said , &quot; &quot; I want you to have a teacher .
And I looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , crazy , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be a teacher . &quot; &quot; And finally , he accepted me , and then I started with a class in his bed , she had my voice .
As a year of a year , we had 25 schools , 15,000 kids to school , and was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
We were supposed to do our work , and we were doing our work , forming teachers , women , democracy , democracy and laws .
One day , I was sitting in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , and I was in the office in Fi@@ ber@@ ar , a day , and I was , one day , I was sitting in the workshop .
( Laughter ) And then , then I saw myself , and suddenly I saw my graduate staff went to the Fourth of my childhood , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Fu@@ ch@@ ate ! &quot; &quot; And I said , as a leader , who do it ?
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know , your life is in play .
But as a leader , you have to keep your compositions .
You have to maintain the posture and display it .
So I wonder , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And those people are raised in mass of my workshop .
So I invited them into the office .
They came up . They were nine , nine , nine .
They are the most grim men you can see .
( Laughter ) X@@ ending with a curse , and the dark , dark , dark , and will go into mass mass in my workshop .
And she invited me to seat and take one .
And then they weren &apos;t going to take .
And of course , the voice of voice that was used for a lot of fear , and I was really successful .
But at the same time , I kept smiling .
And of course , at that point , you can see how did it go , cover my head by a black hi@@ ja@@ b , a black hi@@ ja@@ b , a black hi@@ ja@@ b .
The only thing if I saw the eyes , the only one if I saw my eyes .
I wondered , what do we do ?
&quot; You don &apos;t know what the school would be supposed to be in the female ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And , you know ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I looked at the face and said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s the house of somebody .
See some students . They all learned the Koran , the holy book .
You know ? The Koran says that if you study the holy book , women can be good wives , and they can obe@@ y their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how it &apos;s about that people . ( Laughter ) At that moment , you had to talk to you .
They talked to them , and they said , &quot; &quot; We are , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to do it again . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to have one another time . &quot;
So my personal age raised in mass adoption .
They were killed of fear .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t get me to them .
With all of all of it , all of you are all heavy .
So I &apos;m happy , and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Sure , I &apos;m going to be alive .
But also , when we follow the Taliban during the Taliban , when the Taliban had the power was another story .
We &apos;ve had the deb@@ tors we &apos;ve taught and we teach 80 girls , 3 million students were cl@@ unky , and we &apos;re working with radio .
We went to the Taliban in the Taliban , we went to the country and open a school after another .
We open centers of education .
We opened clinics without stop .
We worked with women and children .
We care about productive health .
We can imagine how many types of technologies can imagine .
I was very happy , and I was really happy . I was love .
And one day , when I was about four educators , and one day , he just led me to the north of Kabul , suddenly , once again , I watched myself on the street of the road , by doing 19 kids .
On the way back to the ground , they block the road .
I asked her to my driver &apos;s driver and reply , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; You may have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; My wife died , and said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What you want to do ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and they have touched me .
At that moment , women sold in the car .
I &apos;m so affected , and I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
So this time , we &apos;re going to kill everybody .
No doubt .
But still , when the moment comes , then the forces of everything that you see and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You know , you know , you can follow that .
So I supported on one side of the car .
My leg rose and out of the car .
I ask them , &quot; &quot; How can I help them ? &quot; &quot; You know what I would help them ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
It matches every day in a place .
Teaching women , they are also giving them the chance to have a job .
Do you want to go . What do you look like ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
What we know , the only one we can do , for time , is to reject a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know anymore .
Obviously it was a filmmaker .
So I came back and said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I went back and said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I went back and said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I went back and said , &quot; &quot; No , we love women .
We just had money to teach them to them , to send them to the school , and nothing else .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all of the very big educators .
They go to their home . No one went .
My job was the only one he was there , and I had no voice .
I was paralyzed , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot;
Because we offer education in the north .
The women came up to think of it .
So I was sitting there and suddenly , and suddenly we &apos;re talking about pulses , because at that moment , one of my wonderful experiments had asked me .
( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; Sha@@ k@@ na ? &quot; &quot; And I answered .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I was trained .
It was the same thing that I was told , and I didn &apos;t think of asking myself .
&quot; &quot; Okay , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s going .
I told I all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next one , you go and give them them .
I mean , two days later , then I &apos;ve done the same way , and then I did the same way , you know , they weren &apos;t there , they were just a little further away , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit farther , the same kids , there &apos;s a foot , and the same way to stop the car .
So I stopped the car .
I went and said , &quot; &quot; Okay , come to me . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , a condition .
So I brought my mosque to the mosque , and to sum , I told them I was going to make teachers .
Now , they are the best educators .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , learn computer and sound sound .
All the areas we don &apos;t know , in the mountain zones , they come with me . They go and go .
And trust us .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That makes education change people .
When I educate people , they change and , as an act , we need to work .
You can &apos;t educate the women and forget of men , because men are the people who get it more difficult to women .
( Laughter ) So we started pasting them , because they have to be conscious of the ability of women , knowing how much that &apos;s going to have the men , and that women can break the same jobs they have them .
So we form men continuously , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think deeply deeply , and I think
I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
So I want to share this .
It was a beautiful , beautiful , peaceful country and peaceful .
We take all the parts .
Women were paid education : angry , engineers , teachers — and we went home to another .
We don &apos;t apply the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of security problems .
But we don &apos;t want to make it .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now , the women of Afghanistan are very hard work .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) Thank you . Be angry .
They studied to be doctors , again .
They studied to be creative and run business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use their whole capacity and all this will happen .
I want to share with you by love , by compassion , by trust and honesty .
If you have these things , you succeed .
We have a poet , Ma@@ w@@ a@@ us R@@ it@@ <unk> .
He said that if you have compassion and if you have love , it can make the world .
And I said , we were able .
And if we were able to make it , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that anybody can get all around the world .
Thank you , thank you so much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So , I was a cardio@@ logist at UC@@ LA — from California , Los Angeles of the heart .
I was told myself was a Som@@ ali of Z@@ o Ze@@ o .
One old chimps are expected to judge the facial expression and the veter@@ ury of it to be a stroke .
You may ask me if you could go to the zoo to search a heart cause .
It will leave clear that the United States in the United States are given to the U.S.
But sometimes , you &apos;ll notice a lot of the medical community , especially for some of any new medical services , but sometimes you want to make a difference .
They managed to download the brain to brain brain imaging in the case of this chimpanzees , and then I watched the sil@@ houette of this le@@ elly for a possible suit , and then I watched the sil@@ ker of this le@@ elly piece was no inflammation .

And this thing is , I &apos;ve been trained in many human patients , and it was identical , with the exception of that si@@ gh@@ pa and that glue .
leading symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients , and for their animals .
And when instead , the same day was going to happen at UC@@ LA Medical Center at UC@@ LA Medical Center .
And I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I started seeing one thing .
So basically , doctors and regulators were the same disease , basically , doctors and activists have the same diseases in their human patients in their human patients , and animals — no heart bra@@ ves , liver tumors , ar@@ thri@@ tis , ar@@ thri@@ tis , and aspir@@ ate .
Well , I have to do with a tor@@ ment .
I think I &apos;ve studied physiology and biology biology during college — even I &apos;ve been doing my activation thesis about Darwin &apos;s Dise@@ ases of Darwin — learn more about the meaningful outbreak among the disease and human rights was a very necessary game for me .
And I started asking myself how I could be , with all these coinci@@ dences , who would never get confused and feel a veter@@ in@@ arian or ir@@ tri@@ pling , to have another version of one of my patients ?
Would we have never met a Would we do it ?
Even more , why should surprise you ?
All doctors accept so some connections between animals and humans .
And all the drugs that we prescribe , that we take or we give our families in an animal .
But there &apos;s a great difference between giving an animal a drug or innov@@ ator or innov@@ ating a human disease , and that animal develops itself by themselves in@@ kable , diabetes or cancer cancer .
Maybe it &apos;s part of the surprises of the divide divide that our world does between the urban and the water .
We &apos;re trying to talk about the urban kids that think it &apos;s growing up in the trees or the bottom axis of a plant .
The human hospitals of today are going to turn every time in profit of technology .
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients that are there and the animal patients who live in the ocean , on the length and in the jun@@ ks .
But I think there &apos;s still a deeper reason :
And scientists and scientists and scientists have accepted intellec@@ tually , the Homo sapiens , the gods and the acceptance of our species , the Homo sapiens , it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one , and it &apos;s just a single one ,
But in our indoors we don &apos;t end up .
I &apos;m interested in me when I go to Mozart or I see my Mozart or I see the Mar@@ ms R@@ ape .
I feel that called the human human mind , but identifying the cost of human human being to see us as a single higher part .
Well , yeah , I fear it .
Now , when I see a human patient , I always wonder : what know the doctors of animals about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
Why could it take care of my human patient if the subject and how a human animal patient ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the suggestion of connections that gave me this kind of reason .
Shar@@ ing heart heart disease .
So there &apos;s a year 2000 , the drug deal@@ ers , they found &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; discovered &quot;
It was described to me in a line from the game that lost the savings savings in a part of life in a part of a land@@ drop in the altar of the altar .
But it turns out that this &quot; &quot; new diagnosis &quot; &quot; is not new .
The veter@@ in@@ ans were used to be diagnosed by trying , trying and even pre@@ proper symptoms in animals , from monkeys , and even surprisingly emotional symptoms , from the 1930s .
How many of the human lives could actually save if this Mexican knowledge was telling us to the question of Hind@@ us ?
T@@ ol@@ sion .
Some patients humans would kill themselves .
You have to be .
Some patients also are also self-@@ man@@ rent .
There are so@@ ites that are cold and over again .
But people have very specific shapes have very specific ways of treating and value , and yet it &apos;s still unfolding in the animals that behave like this .
It shouldn &apos;t be this robotic knowledge for the contrac@@ tor , &apos; parents and the patients who are fighting the hall@@ marks ?
It &apos;s providing pressure and psychotic .
Sometimes the little bit about giving light in depression , sometimes in severe depression , and still in psychotic states .
They can reject their own child , and in cases , they get to the man@@ ta .
The govern@@ ors of casset@@ tes know also that when instead of being a little bit after the age , it can reject its flesh , and den@@ ying it , and in some cases , lets it up to ma@@ dge .
But the veter@@ in@@ ters have a treatment to address this syndrome disorder that allows us to increase oxytocin from the down@@ side .
Ox@@ oxytocin is the hormone hormone , and it turns out that the water has a ren@@ amed .
Wouldn &apos;t it be that information for the Neanderthals and the Neanderthals , &apos; doctors , family doctors and the patients who are faced with the deb@@ tors and the doctor who faced them ?
Despite the fact that it &apos;s all about it , the distance between our all the time is large .
To explain it , a lot of me fear , what I &apos;m going to have to put some of some of them in action .
There are doctors who can be intolerable for medical professionals that are not drivers in medicine .
I mean , the dentist , and psychologists , and psychologists , but especially participants .
Of course , most doctors have no idea that it &apos;s harder to get in days in a College of V@@ ants than in a field of medicine , and when we go to medicine we learn everything that &apos;s relevant to you about a species , the Homo sapiens . But the rest of the learning of learning about health and disease and fish .
So I don &apos;t blame for veter@@ in@@ ers by sent@@ enced to exc@@ esses and viol@@ ating my fellow teens .
So here &apos;s a punchline from the part of veter@@ in@@ ies : how do you call a veter@@ in@@ ury that just knows a species ?
Doctor this is became my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through the programs of Darwin in UC@@ L@@ R , at UC@@ L@@ R , at UC@@ L@@ S that we invited the experts in animals and biologists to engage our medical student of our lives and residents .
And through the genome of Ze@@ alization , we invited us to Education of Medicine and V@@ i@@ tion@@ als to keep educated about the disease and the commands of V@@ i@@ tion@@ -like patients by humans .
And in the world with Ze@@ ama@@ lia the participants are supposed to learn how the treatment of a tiger can help us do better address the cancer of an infant can help us to improve the treatment of a child from a master of child education ; and how better understand the treatment of the stress of a cow , can help us improve the treatment of a philosophical child .
In the world , Ze@@ ster@@ ani , first in America , and now all over the world , doctors and activists leave their own and si@@ mmed and collecting as a colleagues like mine .
In the end , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s time for us to doctors , doctors , and we could allow us to make sure that we are doctors , and we can connect to veter@@ inary teach@@ ings on a health that ranges all species .
Because it turns out that some of the best episodes and humani@@ sts are being trained by doctors who are not humans .
And one of the best ways of treating the human patient is appropriate to ask a lot of attention to how everybody &apos;s other patients on the planet , and they grow , and then they go .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) This word &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; was . Whoa !
( Applause ) Having brain imaging was , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as

Life , a lot of a complex human being , is replaced by medical data : the tunnels , your doctor , your doctor , your medical list .
Suddenly make a test in a disease with legs .
Doctors are starting to talk a symptom that you don &apos;t understand .
They start to signal your finger your body and your elbow .
People starts to change also because they begin to deal with Parkinson &apos;s disease instead of a person .
You ask , &quot; &quot; What would you tell you about the doctor ? &quot; &quot; No before I say &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as I say , I think so much , I think , I think so much .
ask the guy who — who ?
Are you who to study ? Would love love ?
Ask yourself , &quot; &quot; What did I do to do to deserve this to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; And they asked me , &quot; &quot; Can you change something in my life ? &quot;
Are there any other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the kind of good work in all of these cases , because they &apos;re extremely professionals and comprom@@ ised .
But they &apos;re also very used to treat patients , so I would say that sometimes they lose the picture of that for you is a tor@@ t@@ ment to you , and that you become literally in a patient . &quot; &quot; Re@@ conscious means &quot; &quot; meaning &quot; &quot; meaning .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is , it &apos;s going to avoid any way to know your situation , to make your relationship to your family and friends or your teach@@ ings of your life to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re doing .
But with all of this , this thank you so much thank you to take your hands from a couple of days .
Whereas I was in the hospital , I asked myself how to express my dog &apos;s brutality .
It was very hard to get it , because it &apos;s not very common to ask a photo of your own .
I talked to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I don &apos;t tell me .
I &apos;m more like this .
The cure , whatever it is , has to face all of my own self . &quot; &quot; So the next day went back from the hospital to recommend@@ ation of a doctor .
I was decided to change my relationship to the dog and she was decided to learn more about him before to do something as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several types of technologies , open and open my work .
So my very big bet was just taken off the information , and it &apos;s just information , and it &apos;s just a way to give it .
So I &apos;ve created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which , I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which , I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ u , &quot; &quot; which , I created a website called &quot; La Ch@@ u ,
As I had to get rid of them , but that &apos;s why we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) So I picked this word , &quot; La Ch@@ ur@@ ma , &quot; &quot; because in Spanish means &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Finding
In our Western culture means to eradicate or to go back to the Parkinson &apos;s disease , but in other cultures , as an example of Asia , from the United States , can represent many other things .
So of course , I became interested in the opinion of doctors and the rest of the health of health , but I was also interested in the summit for the performer for the poet , by the poet , by designing , or why not , by musicians .
I was interested in the social quality , I was interested in the psychological condition , I was interested in the psychological condition , I was interested in the spirit of the greatest record .
And it worked .
The site developed &quot; &quot; La Ch@@ u &quot; &quot; around the world .
I &apos;ve heard a lot of med@@ al attention from Italy and the foreign minister of 50,000 people in touch with me in a very little while through the air , social media , social media , and most of them were providing opportunities for how to cure my own , but many more were just how to heal me as a person .
For example , you &apos;ve created thousands of videos videos , images , photos and represent art to La C@@ op@@ k .
So here &apos;s the example of Franc@@ o Magazine and his act .
Or what did the artist did , frankly , L@@ ich@@ ty : So , or a sculpture of my tumor , I can &apos;t do it as well .
Now you can see my dog !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something great , you can share the same .
And this was what I was going to happen : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors ... all were connected to me .
Given all of this information and support , I became able to put together a brain team of swollen brain , physicians , onco@@ logists and many hundreds of volunteers I could talk to talk about the data that I was going to talk about , which is really important .
People are able to formul@@ ate a different strategy from my own different languages and as different crops .
So the strategy was going to under@@ cut the entire world , and thousands of years of human history , something that I found quite nicely .
( Music )
So I could take my time to choose .
I picked up the doctor I wanted to work on , I chose the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the time thousands of people were supporting me to feel sorry for me .
All the world would feel that should be stopped by helping me , and this was the most important part of the C@@ Ds .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) R@@ ick great news after surgery : I have — I &apos;m sorry , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s a very low link , which is a kind of thing that don &apos;t make a lot .
I was fully my life and my life lifestyle .
I had a network of electrodes that was very intense , and I had a network of electrodes that was very intense , and had a network map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to analyze this map with a doctor to understand the risks I would run , and if there was one thing I would like to avoid .
Obviously , they are .
This glim@@ mers was the true key to La C@@ op@@ k .
Thousands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
The doctors came to talk to people out that they typically didn &apos;t look at it when it comes from .
I came up with myself , I &apos;m in a continuous state of translation among many different languages , where the science is found with emotion with emotion with the traditional research .
( Music ) &#91; SO@@ LE@@ X &#93; ( Music ) The key to La Ch@@ anc@@ an is the key part of a truly significant society , and connected , cur@@ ing global well-being is from each one of their individuals .
This world world is my source .

I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I couldn &apos;t tell you what it is .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be something of music .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I &apos;m listening to .

The choreograp@@ h , as we call it , is a remarkable space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that makes him holy is not the chance of thinking about the future , or in the past .
We live in this moment .
You have to take a lot of decisions when one goes to the choreograp@@ me .
We had no idea what we were going to touch .
So a half of a song called &quot; &quot; The B@@ loom . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
Everybody heard . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for practical ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about the mistake of someone else &apos;s mistake .
The way I &apos;m good for a mistake when I &apos;m in the choreograp@@ me — before anything , you don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake to peace in that is not that it &apos;s the other thing .
Each mistake is an opportunity for jazz .
Even it &apos;s hard to describe what it would be fun .
For example , if I painted a color , as if I &apos;m playing with the pal@@ ette , we &apos;ll make it like this ...
( Music ) ( Music ) If Christian touches touches a bill ...
See it all fits in your body .
If it touches M@@ i .
You see , all of you , all of the interior of this particular emotional charge that we &apos;re painting .
And yet , if we touch the # tom@@ y@@ ron , most of you have a mistake of a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this .
N@@ one moment , Christian will add this note .
And we &apos;re not going to change it .
It has to play for a second , and then let me stop and talk a moment .
We &apos;re going to see it &apos;s what happens when we touch it .
( Music ) ( Music ) Now , if you don &apos;t , somebody might suggest that as a mistake .
I would just guess it &apos;s a mistake about a mistake if we didn &apos;t react before .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s unpredictable . We &apos;re going to paint this way again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to push it , but something else will change .
We &apos;re going to embrace their ideas , or not .
( Music ) You saw it , played his bill .
And I created a melody .
This time the texture changed the way .
It was a little more rhythmic , a little more intense work in my response .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if it &apos;s not conscious , if every musician is not conscious , and they don &apos;t recognize their partners to engage the idea and we don &apos;t allow their creativity .
This rose is truly incredible .
It &apos;s an puri@@ fying experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking about everyone when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that being able to climb the choreograp@@ h and make music is a blessing .
What do you have to do this ?
We are all musicians of jazz , our stereotyp@@ o is not the most right thing to do .
( Laughter ) So I just wanted to show you how to do it .
And the other reason is that we don &apos;t make micro@@ cel in jazz .
There are people who do it .
But it &apos;s cleaning the artistic functionality .
If it tells the band that we touched , and I want to make it , and I &apos;m going to tell you .
Take something .
One , two , two , three , three , four .

Tell me , &quot; &quot; A@@ tie me on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It &apos;s more than to see what I can perceive as what I can do .
If I want music music from a certain level , the first step to me is being patient , listen , it &apos;s going to be patient , listen to what happens to me .
When you do , motivated and inspire to the other musicians and they dance more , and that &apos;s going to do it .
Look , one , two , two , three , three , four .

It &apos;s not about spreading my vision .
We &apos;re going to be at the moment when we accept one another and let them move to creativity .
Thank you .

He wrote this to his love .
I &apos;m going to be s@@ inc@@ ere , so much of these amazing talks and ideas that are being exposed to , inv@@ athetic in the early 70s , sitting here talking to television &apos;s television .
Everybody sees television .
I like them . I love us some things .
Here in America people .
The average person watching television is almost five hours a day .
Right ?
He &apos;s alive , I live in television , so I think it &apos;s beautiful .
But people don &apos;t like it .
They were , of course , un@@ used crops .
It &apos;s useless , and things are useless , trust me .
My mother , when I was a girl , she &apos;d call it &quot; &quot; the silver box . &quot; &quot; My intention today isn &apos;t de@@ bed if there &apos;s a good television or television television , my view today is telling me that the television must be conscious .
If I think that television has consciousness is because I think that television reflects directly the social and social political and emotional policy has made out of our n@@ uc@@ ics of our nation .
All of that is intrinsic to humans , and it gave our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk today or bad .
We talk about popular television TV .
We talk about 10 programs of audience during a 50-@@ year period .
Like that index doesn &apos;t only do what you hear about , which is the notion of our social unconscious and collective social unconscious , if you don &apos;t , like those 10 programs for decades reflecting the idea of our social consciousness ?
How can we evolve the television over time , and that tells our society our society ?
By leveraging the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , if you take away that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four basic astronomers .
They suffer , relationships , power , and the wish they can .
As humans , what you have to remember is that we evolved with the time we evolved , we evolved over time until we had mastered these basic animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel angry , compassion .
This isn &apos;t just in the animal kingdom .
The other thing is the human beings we love to love .
I love to see television .
This is something that is happening in the animal world .
As you can play like you like to play , but you don &apos;t get to you .
So I want to figure out what it understands from this ever-@@ exclusive relationship of humans between the computer and the human consciousness .
Why is it wrong ?
The kid pointed out like his sketches , and the angel sitting in our shoulder .
So television does work like our consciousness , try and reward ourselves at the same time ?
To start the challenge of these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
We launched 50 years to suffer 50 years from the 19@@ 60 century .
We &apos;ve done the top 20 of the audience from the audience of the audience that &apos;s 50 years old — thousands of programs .
We talk about 3,000 people nearly 3@@ 600 , and we &apos;ve asked how to feel emotionally .
How did you feel you meet each one of these programs ?
Did you meet a moral deal ?
Did you feel clear ? Do you know ?
What meant for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean this was taken out in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of necessary age are universal .
And second the accomplishments , an 80 percent of the most popular programs in the U.S.
I wish for our political audiences to feel identified .
I want to breathe through the two people before I saw the first slide : &quot; &quot; Why would it really inspired me to think about it in the sense of consciousness and the damage that consciousness can take us on the day the day , gave it through the legitimate status , Jack S@@ ter@@ k .
And so in what I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to breathe thanks to the opening director director of Hans Rosling , who would come to see .
Well , let &apos;s go .
Here you see , since 1960 , since 1960 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to start the fact that we &apos;re going to start the state of account and the state of a moral age , which , to this study , we define contraception as the programs of television that I &apos;m going to make me feel better with the world .
A moral age is the programs that don &apos;t buy the difference between good and wrong .
By the beginning , you see that in 1960 , inspirational success .
So we see television .
A moral age starts to make it .
Pretty much at the end of 60 , the am@@ erec@@ orded moral age increases , and the inspirational bottom .
Why ?
The crisis of C@@ uba , the murder crisis and J@@ FC , the movement of the P@@ uba , the movement of the War on , the assass@@ ination of M@@ am , the assass@@ ination of M@@ am , the murder of M@@ art@@ ate Luther King and B@@ ob@@ by Kennedy , the Green Climate Institute .
Look what happens .
1970 condem@@ ning it .
A moral age dis@@ offer .
They put together , more Ronald Reagan , a television director , is in control .
It &apos;s going to raise the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t , you can &apos;t do it , but you &apos;re going to do it , you know , the disaster of Ch@@ om@@ la@@ lia , Chernobyl .
A moral acu@@ ity becomes the dominant rate of 1990 to the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This graph shows a similar trend .
But in this case , we have the happiness of the red carpet — the social media , the social media , the social media .
At that time in television , we have &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy Gri@@ e , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy Gri@@ de , &quot; &quot; and the national revolution reflecting happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase , and happiness opens up everything .
It starts to rise .

We turn 196@@ 9 and look what happens .
The happiness , the magic , and the social media , they &apos;re not just fighting in our society , but there are two programs , &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ shot &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Good@@ le , &quot; &quot; which in 196@@ 9 are number two and number three things in the rate .
What was the number one ?
( Laughter ) And the series of physicists and socially in@@ rever@@ ment , &quot; Roots and Martin &apos;s L@@ au@@ N@@ N@@ As &quot; &quot; Roots and C@@ Ds , &quot; &quot; Roy and M@@ C@@ N@@ N@@ L@@ au@@ <unk> .
They all live together .
The spec@@ t@@ Line was made .
Let &apos;s see this peak in 196@@ 6 with a password pain .
When you &apos;re listening to the term , success is successful , you mean ?
I mean , in 196@@ 6 , the head of 196@@ 6 , the ph@@ ub@@ ese pup@@ ils are told .
So this was the first program that allow us to be honest , &quot; &quot; My god , I can comment what I think of the War am , about the president , through the television , through the television , through the television . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it means for an unprecedented precedent .
Well , the same thing is , the same as a look at what happens .
In the 1970s , the rand@@ o stopped .
We don &apos;t see television for fun .
The social media , and the way it &apos;s high .
Now look at this .
What was the same was the 70 ?
We have &quot; &quot; all in the family , &quot; &quot; San@@ ford and I am , and the main shows in the top 10 days — M@@ AS .
In the 50 years of television that we study , seven of the most un@@ documented programs in the Vietnam War are , five of the heel during the announced announced .
So just a generation , in 20 years , and we &apos;ve learned , if you &apos;re going to do it , television can do that ?
Could I feel that ?
Does change change ?
The audience so I knew , I want to tell you that the people of the digital didn &apos;t invent the problems .
Archie B@@ un@@ ker was thrown out of his pup@@ pet with the rest of us .
This is another pie . With other vari@@ ance : fantasy and imagination , which they are defined as as well , like , &quot; &quot; I think of reality as the way &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; it makes me better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing in front of the internal island of working .
( Laughter ) You know , every time I was thinking about it and imagination will do it , and it goes out of a stop .
We want to see programs about saving money and stop ?
It &apos;s not . We &apos;ve been trying to have the number of leader &quot; &quot; The Book of Organ@@ ic &quot; &quot; which was cataly@@ zing the rise 10 in 1973 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million of dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Book of Charlie . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s — another peak of the U.S.
What was there on those programs ?
G@@ ane and rich .
&quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No .
A huge increase of our national psyche with made quickly and tough : the stop .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
You &apos;re either not in my sandwich , I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard or read them about the fall of the herd and the us@@ er@@ ance of reality .
As we say it in this rose , X brand a place .
The novels of humor , the decade of humor , you &apos;re like &quot; &quot; F@@ end@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ is@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But look : X brand a place .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , the mood succum@@ ding and the judgment .
Why not ?
We had the presi@@ dency 2,000 of the prize for the Su@@ mi@@ ma .
It stems from technological ent@@ ries .
It &apos;s September of September .
The anti@@ x for@@ ums is everywhere .
Take what happens with time .
In the course of the century , the advent of the del@@ usion .
What do people care about their television ?
I would think it &apos;s binding or des@@ ired .
Give me happiness , my world are still below .
Don &apos;t , they want to judge .
I can work outside the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin dance .
I can choose to choose the new triump@@ h . You &apos;re just left .
Great , right ?
( Laughter ) So the radically different thing about this is that these programs , of pure fun , had been out there for 50 years — that was when I said , at the beginning ? See a basic instinct .
We are animals , we need our mothers .
There wasn &apos;t a piece of television without an im@@ ap@@ ent and dominant mother of television .
In the 1930s — JL : Jim@@ us see at the relaxed end of the program , &quot; &quot; Take it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Take it , Be@@ autiful Be@@ autiful .

It wasn &apos;t a politician .
It was a 12@@ -year-old eight-@@ year-old .
So what I realized was that wasn &apos;t just in Cam@@ bodi@@ a , but in the 17@@ 00s , in the development of the development that tortured the right to the right for the right to a lawyer , and the right to not be tortured by the right law and the right person to not be tortured .
And I realized that there was an incredible sense of opportunities for all of us , and I realized that there was an incredible sense of opportunities for all of us as global community method .
I often think of tor@@ t@@ as as a form of political torture or that it is reserved for the yers , but in fact , the 95 percent of the tor@@ ary of today are not in political prisoners .
They are for people who are going to die in court systems , and unfortunately , farmers , the torture is the cheapest way to be cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper than ever .
The day of this co@@ ats that you may be possible for us as a world community , if we take that decision , then we take that decision , put it in and close with tor@@ ming as method method for our life , but this is a little still of three things .
First of all , the infrastructure of power and connection defenses scale .
The second is to make sure that there &apos;s a very high and systematic charge of accidents .
And the third is the commitment .
So the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we were allowed ?
Could we do something by those countries ?
And I founded Bri@@ st@@ ent@@ ries itself , and it has a specific mission to end with tor@@ tor@@ ment , like research method and put together in practice because of the research method and put them in practice , and in the courts of a early stage in Commission@@ er and in the courts .
And yet my first experiment came out of Cam@@ bodi@@ a and my first visit of my first visit to Cam@@ p , when I was in 1992 , but when I was in 1994 , there was fewer than 10 inches in the country because K@@ Mi@@ z killed everyone .
And even 20 years later , there were only 10 inches from the country , and so at the same time , in a prison camp , you don &apos;t just find yourself as a 13-year-old boy , and you ask me , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to have 10 years because my husband &apos;s kid , and I ask you , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Why are we here ?
The first group of defenses brought together and I don &apos;t remember , as I laughed , I wonder , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do to do to research ?
And the room was in silence , and finally , a woman stood up , &#91; name &#93; , &quot; &quot; he said &quot; &quot; my teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I have become more than one percent of people , and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to do more than one of the police to do this , and we &apos;re talking about it , like , from the fact
And these defenses they had to suffer from value to decide who would start to defend and support between them to be able to put together in practice .
And I still remember the early cases where they came from , the top 25 together , she &apos;s and the rest of it , and they were supportive of the rest , and they were supportive of the same way the ones were saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do the same way in the same way we have to have done . &quot; &quot; But one day came up the perfect case . It was a woman who was selling himself .
She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d seen it as a person going to come up , and then it changed the young people in a matter of a matter , but the police came , and I got nothing on top .
For that then she was embarrassed . She had burned . She had an abortion .
And when he took his case , he had his case , for the first stop , and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no case in all sorts of other things in the air , and so it will be translated into freedom . &quot; &quot; And the defenses I started started taking cases over the course of Cam@@ p &apos;s story , and as a little bit as a little bit starting to change the course of Cam@@ p &apos;s story .
But Cam@@ it &apos;s not sounds .
He was thinking , so it &apos;s just a Cam@@ p ?
Or also other countries ?
But it turns out in so many countries — it turns out in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it &apos;s going to be in so many countries — it turns
In the Bur@@ har@@ i came in a prison , and there was no 12 years old , he stole a cell phone cell phone .
Or a woman , I pasted my baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I am , but I &apos;m about it , but I &apos;m about it , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I know , but I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I was accused .
And when I went with the CEO of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to let it in freedom .
A creator will let it loose on it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can &apos;t talk about it , but look at my own prison , 80 percent of the two billion people are here are un@@ labeled .
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t just the media anymore , but it wasn &apos;t just the media .
For example , in Cam@@ bodi@@ a , what happened was that &#91; &quot; &quot; French &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; name &#93; it wasn &apos;t sounds but he had the 24 / 7 , and the same way , in China , I always told me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the wilderness when we can put it in . &quot; &quot; Or in C@@ im@@ im and , where I can remember , and I said , &quot; &quot; I mean
We can &apos;t help us to create fairness because we can &apos;t help the fairness , and then we said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to think you can &apos;t help them to create fairness , and with this organization , &quot; &quot; I want you to think you can &apos;t help to create fairness .
So , the solution we found was the solution that we found was , and then , the solution .
And I said , &quot; &quot; But here &apos;s thousands of millions of dollars , and I decided to put me with another group of bread . What they told me was they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , now we don &apos;t have the streets in the streets , and the police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; But here are you investing tens of millions of dollars in the developing system system .
What &apos;s going on is that ? &quot; &quot; Re@@ in@@ vi@@ me with the development agencies and they were operating , and the expectation , which result to be normal , instead of password .
He showed me also a manual who was done .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it .
They were perfectly formed .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a question . Did you think everybody &apos;s going to be a taker away , that &apos;s going to get them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , I said , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ tu@@ ch@@ ans . &quot;
And so the key things are not just a lot of people , but to find a way to make a way to make a practice in practice systematically , because they are the exception of the system for the people who are being tortured .
And while I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; yeah , of course , it seems like if you could do it , but we can do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because there &apos;s something big .
And that &apos;s a lot of reason why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first of them is that people about the fact that the people about it are the ability to create miracles through their commitment .
And it &apos;s not just In@@ no@@ m , who I told you about C@@ im@@ bab@@ l and , but also defenses all over the world are getting these key words .
We have a program called Ma@@ k@@ Ma@@ ers , and we realized there were drowning , and we realized , how we can support them ?
So it &apos;s only a contest in line where you will win five thousand dollars if you will win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to have any innovation in practice .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> Ma@@ it@@ ers around the world , from Sri L@@ anka to S@@ w@@ ag@@ an@@ ty or the Democratic Republic of Congo , which was five billion dollars , by by texting , and in the West , programs and any other way that you find out .
And there &apos;s not only these Neanderthals , but there are also many people who understood that they are actually their contacts and how they can move them .
For example , in China , the laws that the cops were tortured to the people they were blogging , they were told they were told .
And while I was sitting with one of our tweets , I said , &quot; &quot; And how can we spread it ? How can we make sure that if we can make our practice ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And the four of the best schools in the Muslim world have opened themselves and came from the police commission@@
I talked about the fact that we need to form and support the defenses .
We need to make practice in practice in practice all the time .
But the third one , the most important point , is that we commit this .
And often people said me , &quot; &quot; Well this is very good , but it &apos;s too idealistic .
I would come back . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think of this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same outcome , because that &apos;s exactly the same outcome that used or the people who have decided to end with slavery .
It started with a small group of people who have decided to engage .
One of our favorite poems of the defenses , who are shared with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about value , friends , the way , the way it &apos;s going to be clear , and there &apos;s a lot of game in the game , but in the background , you don &apos;t have it . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m safe so if we can make a world like a worldwide community to support not just the defen@@ seless , but also the whole world in the system that &apos;s trying to achieve that
And I &apos;m always fun , because I know the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure to talk about you , but I &apos;m going to do it really ? &quot; &quot; Well , first you &apos;ll say you know what you can do . And secondly , let you know you can do with the story of mine &apos;s story , which in fact was my inspi@@ rations to make the Inter@@ na@@ tionary English of me .
Vision was a four-@@ year story when I met him , and I was in a Cam@@ p in a Cam@@ p in the prov@@ ince of K@@ and@@ al . But as it was born in prison , everybody had a lot of gratitude , even the rain , so it was the only one that could go and come out of the repression .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s a recur@@ ring . And so when you consider it , it began to grow , which is what you also see ?
What was it was going to happen by the first re@@ tail , and the second and then the third one , and then finally , a little bit of air , moving my head into the body , and then I &apos;ll see a little bit of air , and then I pasted my head , because what he wanted to do was going to make my way to my life to go to him .
Of course , I never had to go to the whole world , and I was trying to visit the whole world , but I wanted to visit the every 15@@ 6 of mine .
Or if they were dark , it was as iron on the street , and it took his fingers through it .
And most of the men in the prison claim that it was his greatest release and his sun and the sun and all the exc@@ bling , and I thought , well , here &apos;s physics .
I was on a bed without nothing , no material material , but with a sense of his own journey , I think we &apos;re all going to be able to do it all . And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the one thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so why I thank you to have the defen@@ seless imagination to imagine a new world with all of us together , and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Let me take a talk to a red carpet . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Story@@ king a story . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; As a inspired by a inspired by the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not just how you think about TED .
In fact , if you use too much of these mechanisms , you look at a clip or an emotional exc@@ itation .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I &apos;d like to share it with you , because listening to several hundred of TED emails , like these .
I gave them with the ultimate audience , and I learned directly directly from them the secrets of a great talk .
And even though these actors and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common common .
And it &apos;s this : The main task as a filmmaker is to transfer the mind of who who wants to listen to it extraordinary , a stranger and beautiful object we call it .
Let me explain it .
This is Hy@@ y .
This is a point of giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s landing .

( Applause ) 1,@@ 200 people , many of which have never been seen before they sit before they sit before they sit before they sit in their brains with their brains .
They literally just start labe@@ ling the same pattern .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they are feeling the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to take a look at the brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain &apos;s brain .
There &apos;s millions of neurons involved in a le@@ monade .
But look here , right here : a few billion are connected to each other a way .
inside the face of the entire audience .
So it &apos;s like , just a couple of minutes , a pattern that has millions of neurons of robotic neurons to one 200 heads , only with people listening to a voice and look at a face .
But I hope that &apos;s an idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern of information that helps understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from a lot of forms and soft , from the complex and analy@@ sts of the simple and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and
So here &apos;s a couple of examples of co-@@ parties since TED stage .
Sir RKCP is the key of our future of our kids .
( Video ) Sir Sir Ken Rob@@ in@@ son : What I wish now is that creativity now and we have the same status .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : E@@ SL Har@@ dy built with bamboo is beautiful .
( Video ) Ell@@ is Har@@ dy : It &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , resi@@ sted and the junk light .
CA : Ch@@ im@@ gu@@ el A@@ di@@ chi@@ e people are more than one identity .
( Laughter ) ( Music ) Ch@@ im@@ gu@@ e A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that it &apos;s fake .
CA : So your mind opens up ideas , and you don &apos;t fix it .
They are cared for connected .
Govern@@ ally , there &apos;s an incredible incredible structure that &apos;s your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like sailing to the world .
And it &apos;s about millions of individual ideas .
If you , for example , a small cre@@ mation of the world is the idea that the j@@ elly are loved , then , then , in the green it , we stopped it that way .
But if you add another one out of your view of the world , it &apos;s the idea that the leop@@ ards are dangerous , then the green that &apos;s going to pass a little bit different .
So it &apos;s pretty obvious that the ideas that make your view of the world are crucial .
You need to be the most significant thing that you can possibly be as possible , and it &apos;s wonderful world a real world .
Now , the different things about the world of people can be very different .
For example , how is it wrong in the world where you see this picture : ( Video ) D@@ alia Mo@@ ga@@ hed : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman &apos;s wife , &quot; &quot; an inner man , even if I said , &quot; &quot; A woman who says &quot; &quot; a man &quot; &quot; ?
Or , &quot; &quot; I guess &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist of a terrorist ? &quot; &quot; ?
CA : Do you want the answer , there &apos;s millions of people out there who would respond differently .
If you communicate in the right way , you &apos;ll be able to change , always the way that somebody sees the world and turn its actions so much now like the world .
The ideas are the most powerful force that we make human culture .
So if you accept that your main task as a storyteller is to build an idea in your own audience , here are four items to address that task : First , limiting your talk to a single idea .
The ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce the content to make sure that you &apos;re going to take the content to make sure that I love you , and have the chance of explaining it .
You have to make a context , sharing examples , doing that real .
So you take an idea , and you &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on your whole talk to your talk , so everything you want to invite you in a way .
And secondly , it turns out that people will listen to you .
Before we start building things in the mind of your audiences , you have to have their permission to get it into .
What is the tool to do this ?
Curiosity .
I shared curiosity from my audiences .
Use open-ended questions , which lead to identify why something has no sense and accurate .
If you can reveal a dis@@ connection in the view of someone &apos;s view , they feel they will need to cover that knowledge .
And when you dive into that wish is much easier to start building the idea .
Third , you can and your idea , piece of conception that your audience is known .
Using the power of language to weave together together together concepts that exist in the mind of who you are , but not in your language , in your language .
They start where they are .
The actors often forget that a lot of terms that many terms of terms and conception of what they live in are completely close to their audience .
Well , unlike a collection play a crucial role to show you how they stack them up , because they reveal the kind of pattern , based on an idea that you can hear .
For example , when Jennifer invited me to try to explain the incredible new biotech of this brain called CRISPR , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you had a text machine .
The GMT allows us to cut and take genetic information very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic understanding of how this offers a great moment of r@@ erec@@ orded times as fit in our mind .
It &apos;s important , for so much , to try to talk to the talk of trust , and see that parts are most useless .
Gone . Here &apos;s the end of the end , it &apos;s going to make your ideas deserve to be sharing .
So I mean , I mean , what do you think of this question ?
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea is only to benefit from you and your organization , then I &apos;m happy , probably not deser@@ tifying .
The audience will move through you .
But if you think that the idea has the ability to illumin@@ ate the day someone or to change the perspective of someone &apos;s perspective to better or inspire somebody to do things else else , then you have the essential ingredient for a good talk of truth , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
We only have a 25 percent of what we &apos;ve heard .
I promised him that I would never forget that I would want to listen to every day I would never forget .

A world where we &apos;re not listening to each other &apos;s other people &apos;s other way we &apos;re not listening to each other each other &apos;s other labs .
To re@@ submit the ear and put the ear listened to the ear , to re@@ submit the ear and put the ear .
It &apos;s to appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my se@@ ti@@ d .
We see that everyday sounds can be very interesting if we take attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine you &apos;re in a street of any place in America , and you find yourself a guy who &apos;s the name of this apple ?
And you say , &quot; &quot; Per@@ mate , this is the O@@ ak , this is the O@@ ak , that &apos;s the O@@ ak .
This is the 26 , 26 , that the 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , apples you don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , apples like that are just low-@@ name with the streets .
Now , imagine you &apos;re on a corpus of whatever of Japan , Mi@@ kers to the person who you have on the side and ask yourself , &quot; Per@@ mate , how do you call this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the age of 17 and the 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
apples .
Meet Google M@@ ap@@ s here . There are the 14 , 15 , 18 , 17 , 18 .
All of those apples have names , and the streets are just the lowest .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you meet your home ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is 8 .
M@@ age 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Okay . But I walk through the slide I looked at the street , &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Sure . They &apos;re going to be built on the package in the way they were built .
The first house built on an apple is house number one .
The second house you built is the house number two .
The third one is the house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; I love how sometimes we have to go on the other side of the world to tell us about things that we &apos;re un@@ consciously , and realize that the opposite they can be true .
Like , for example , there are doctors in China who believe their work is healthy .
So every month that you &apos;re going to pay for you , and when you get sick , you don &apos;t know why you &apos;re smiling because you think you &apos;re missing in your work . You &apos;re rich when you &apos;re healthy , I don &apos;t care .
( Applause ) We think of the music that &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of music sentence . One , two , three , four .
But in the music music of the West Africa , one is the end of the sentence , like the end of one .
So , you can listen to listen to not just telling yourself not just the way that you count : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that there &apos;s a claim that for any true thing that you say about India , the next will also be true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so much at TED as another place , that for me as a whole place , that for any brilliant idea that we have or listen , the wrong thing can be true .
It discou@@ raged me un@@ insul@@ ous hair .
