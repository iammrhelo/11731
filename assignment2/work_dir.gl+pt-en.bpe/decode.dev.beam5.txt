( Audio ) ( Laughter ) And I wonder in Sattain Am , the suitcase . In the name of Alia , the suitcase .
( Laughter ) I have been in a middle class family .
My father was five years ago when he lost his father , but when he was born , he was a man of business .
If your kids were children or girls , if their children were child or boys , they were children or girls , and they were going to go to school .
So I suppose I was saving .
Mike had been killed 16 times .
Depression 16 , we are alive .
You can imagine what I had to spend when it was a girl .
They had no women being transported to the cemetery , or the child being led to a tutarian .
At that moment , when I finished the institutionary , I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I graduated from my education , the way I was going to college .
I was in my country , there &apos;s no praying for women in the middle of the world , even though they accepted me in medicine , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father sent me to America .
In America .
I took my studies .
Wherever killed my education , Rausia invaded my country .
Do you know ? When I was finishing my class , I found that I was going to go to my family and my country .
They had months and I had no news .
My family found out in a restrained field .
So instead I finished the research , I brought my family to America .
I want you to be saved .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I first listened to the news , when I was following my country , I was going to go to the heart .
I gave my country back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
She was an university .
I was expected .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my fox .
So I got to the field of restrained .
And when I came to the field of Pakista , I was seven and seven and a half million restrained .
Of course , about 90 percent were women and children . Most men , or they die in war or they were either . And they know ?
When I was doing the infidelity , when I was going to graduate students , when I was going to graduate students , I fell into things that don &apos;t imagine .
I saw a living in between five and eight kids there , sitting there sitting in a way , crying out to you .
I saw a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , without a study , or not income , or a place in the living room .
They were going to be lost their parents , their focus and that with 10 or seven years , they had to pull out their families , be their head &apos;s head , and try to protect their irharm .
The situation was absolutely unlocking .
My heart did not know what to do .
( Laughter ) At that moment , a lot of a impulse .
( Laughter ) At that moment , I felt that I can do for these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m a person who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education changed my life .
He transformed me . He took me a position .
They gave me trust . It gave me a career .
He gave me to pull my family back to my family , bringing my family to another country , so that he was saved .
And at that moment I knew that what I would have was to provide my people was education and health and that was what I tried to do .
But think what was easy ?
Well , because of that , women don &apos;t have access to education .
And so , after the invention of Rusa in Affairs , people don &apos;t rely on anybody .
It was really hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot;
Somebody comes from the United States .
Somebody who raised you here .
They were in me ? Of course .
So what it really needed was to win the trust of this community .
How am I going to do it ?
I was documenting it , I documented myself , I looked and I looked at it .
Look questions .
So finally , I found a man .
She had 80 years .
It was a musician .
It &apos;s going to be his tender on the floor , and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I want to become a teacher .
And I looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , crazy , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a
So one year , we had 25 kids installed , 15,000 kids going to school , and it was unbelievable .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
Of course , we were going to make our work , forming teachers , and by the women of women , the human rights , democracy and laws .
One day , one day , I was in the Office Foundation , a day , I was in the Office in Fishar , a day , I was in the Office in Fishar , Pakista , a day , in the Office .
And then , suddenly I saw that all my little run away , and suddenly , I saw that all my little run away from the curator and scattered my doors , being the leader , who do it ?
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on play .
But as a leader , you have to keep the composition .
You have to keep the composition and play it .
So I asked myself , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people accused in my office .
So I invited them into the office .
They lived . They went up , nine takers .
They were the most lucky men they can see .
( Laughter ) So Xly with a dismissed thing , my black clothes , black , turbine , and they entered a mash in my office .
And they invited me to sit and take a piano .
They didn &apos;t take it .
And of course , the ton of voice that employers would use a lot of fear , and I was really really affected .
But at the same time , it kept me .
And , of course , at that moment , you see as seeing as soon as the head of the head of a black jab , and , of course , in that moment , I see as seeing the head of my head by a black jab .
The only one that if I watched my eyes were my eyes .
He said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know that school is going to be prohibiting women ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And they know ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And
They watch some students . They all learn the Koran , the holy book .
Do you know ? The Koran says that if you study the women , the women can be good wives , and they can obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s like it &apos;s like it &apos;s going to be good wives .
They talked about them and they said , &quot; &quot; We saw it , we &apos;re okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And you know ? So I &apos;m going to give you it again , and you got a glimmer and laughed .
I had my personal staff in my office .
They were afraid of fear .
They didn &apos;t know me .
They didn &apos;t know why they weren &apos;t going to get me out .
With all of it , they all were bad news .
I mean , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) And of course I claim to be alive .
But also , as we continue to educate the Taliban during the Taliban , when the Taliban had the power was another story .
We went back to the clinic and we teach the 80 girls , 3,000 students , who we educate without cesessizing .
The Taliban dropped from the Taliban , we went through the country and opened a school after another .
We open up education centers .
We open clinics without stop .
We work with women and children .
We face it about reproductive health .
We use how many types of formations can imagine .
I was so happy . I was charming with my work .
And one day , when I was about four polls and a garment , I went north to North Kabul , suddenly the north of the road , made me 19 kids .
With the way back to the site , blocking the road .
I asked my driver who came out and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said nothing , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ?
At that moment , women were living inside the car .
I &apos;m very significant , and I mean , this is the end .
This time , you &apos;ll kill everyone .
She had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , then the moment comes out , then the whole thing comes out and what you do .
It &apos;s your heart .
I mean , you know , you can follow that .
So I supported me on one side of the car .
My leg tremors and the car coming out of the car .
I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I help you ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Every day from one place to another .
They go back to women , and they also give them the chance to have a job .
Did you remember it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
What we &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; Statistics and rehearsal , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Okay .
So we know , the only one we can do , the way we can do , for the time we have to make a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . They know what it means .
Obviously it was a trunk .
So I left it up and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to marvel , marshes . &quot; &quot; And I went to the car , and I sat down on the car , sat down , and he sat down to the driver .
We only had money to teach them to send them to school , and nothing else .
When I came back , obviously all the educators markers .
Look at their home . Nobody died .
My garage was the only one I was there , and I had had no voice .
I was confused , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What will I do ? &quot; &quot; So how do I solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;re already feeding education in the north .
Some of women came to be taught .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly we are here talking about impulses , because at that moment , one of my wonderful excites requests asked me .
And he called me , &quot; &quot; Skennie ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . What do you do ? &quot;
It was equal what I said , I didn &apos;t believe me , and I was asking myself questions .
Okay , tell me that &apos;s going .
It &apos;s the whole story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Vale , for the next door , you &apos;re going to come and make them .
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I did the same way , you know that ? They weren &apos;t there , they were a little further away , the same kids , there &apos;s going to be a little further , the same kids , there &apos;s going to get the car .
So I had stopped the car .
I came back and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah .
So I took the mosque to the mosque to summarize , and to summarize , I would give them teachers .
Now , they are the best educators .
They learn English as being teachers , learn how to be teachers and are the ones .
And all the areas that we don &apos;t know , in the mountain areas , they come to me . They go forward and go .
And protects us .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education bows people .
When we educate people , they change and , in action , we need to work for equality .
You can &apos;t raise the women and forget of men , because men are the people who read the most difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started to educate them , because it &apos;s supposed to be conscious of women , to know how the potential men have the men and that females can discharge the same jobs they have .
So we formed men continuously , and I really believe deeply deeply , and I believe deeply deeply , and I believe deeply deeply , and I believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply
I live in a country that I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful and beautiful country .
We take all the parts .
The women had education : the women had education , women , their teachers ...
We will not close the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of the security problems .
But we still want the Affairs of before .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now the women of Afghanistan are very , very hard .
Gradoubt . Ford to be used .
They were to be patient , again .
They &apos;re going to be teachers and run the business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people employing all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share it with you for the love of compassion , for compassion , for trust , and honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;re successful .
We have a poet , Mawlentnail .
He said , if you have compassion , and if you have love , you have to gain the world .
And I said , we could .
And if we were able to be Affairs , I &apos;m safe at 100 percent than anybody can do all the world .
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Seven years ago I had a phone call that changed my life .
So I was cardiovascular to UCLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I was called it was a veteriny of the Zimbabwe of Los Angeles .
A maximum magnifying chimpanzees will wait for paralysis and trolls that would become a brain infected .
I wondered if I could go to the zoo to search for a possible cause .
It requires clear that the zoo of the United States are told with veteran equipped equipped and highly trusted that care about their patients .
But sometimes , it &apos;s going to make the medical community , especially for some specialized consultation , especially for some consultation .
It &apos;s going to discharge the brain infected in the case of brain of this magician to evaluate this ambiguous heart , and I ate that the pertude of this marvel of the marvel didn &apos;t mean . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here in this photo , absying the heart of a lion , after saving your heart .
And this procedued procedures , which I &apos;ve already gained in a lot of human patients , was everge with the exception , and the glue .
The symptoms , decorating symptoms , measurements , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients .
And when instead , in the same day , I was visiting from UCLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
And I started to see clearly one thing : one thing : I started to see it clearly one thing .
The same physicians have basically the same doctors and animals , basically physicians , basically doctors and the victims of the same patient in their human patients and animals , and the victims of the genius in their own human patients and animals , in a sense , legendotonic arteries and authenticity .
Well , I have to make a confused .
I still studied physiology , and biology evolves during college — even I did my thesis about Darwin &apos;s theirs about Darwin — to learn more about the significant importance between animal diseases and human rights was a very accurate touch for me .
And I started asking myself how could it be , with all of those coinciations , who never ask me to think about the opinions of a veterinary or public consultation , to have another perspective on one of my human patients ?
Are we going to have a veterinoninarian conferences ?
But still , why should it be surprising ?
All the doctors accept some biological connections among animals and humans .
All the medicines we prescribe , we take or we give our families that we take before a animal .
But there &apos;s a big distinction between giving a brand animal or ingenuity of a drug , and that animal animal is a human , and that animal animal is really unfolding , diabetes or cancer .
Maybe it &apos;s a part of the surprise of the separity of the separately that our world does between urban and non-urban .
We &apos;re going to talk about those urban kids that think that the fish grow in the trees or the quy-axis of a plant .
The human hospitals today are going to turn closer and further into the cathedrals of technology .
And this creates a psychological disorder between human patients that are still treated and the animals that live in the oceans , in the greatly and in the jungle .
But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason
And scientists and scientists , scientists and scientists , scientists and scientists , scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and
But in our inner way we don &apos;t end .
Pasme me to me when I &apos;m listening to Mozart or I see a lot of my own photos that made Mars Rossee .
I feel that called the human exception of human awareness , still by understanding the scientific costs of verbs as a superior , the part .
Well , but this teche I &apos;m trying to do .
Now , when I see the human patient , I always ask myself , &quot; What do you know ? &quot;
How could it take better to my human patient if you saw an animal animal ?
And there are some examples of the subjects that made me feel this kind of reasonable .
It &apos;s just induced heart disease .
Back in the year 2000 , the human carders found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found out .
It was description of an addictive father to the game that has lost the savings of the entire life of life in a node in front of me .
But it turns out that the new human diagnosis is not new and exclusive .
The veterinos had been diagnosed with instances , treating them and even predicts emotionally induced in animals , from the last decade of 70s .
How many human lives could save themselves if this veterinary rate was going to be used by medical medical physicians and carriers ?
Autolations .
Some human patients would kill themselves .
( Laughter ) No , there &apos;s a lot of corners .
Some patients are also eating themselves .
There &apos;s guarantors that live in a long way , and it &apos;s going to be sandwich .
But the veterinos are very specific shapes and effective ways of dealing with and even predictances in animals that behave like this .
It should not be that veterinary knowledge of psychopathic psychotherapists , of parents and the patients who are fighting with autism ?
He sent possession and psychopaths .
Sometimes in a little bit of giving the light some women fall in depression , sometimes in severe depression , and even in psychotic states .
They can bend their own child &apos;s own , and in the extreme cases , we &apos;re going to get the manure .
The camels of bread you know also that when instead of an ever-avia , a little bit after the time , it can vibrate its copile , and denying the alony , and in some cases , pathogens to kill .
But the veterinachment was a treatment to address this particular slide of the police station that will increase oxytocin .
oxytocin is the face of skies , and it causes the eaveswater to get a renewed .
It should not be this information by obituaries and Victologists , from family physicians and the patients who are going to face the presence and the psychopathetic psychopaths ?
Most of the promise that this is all of this , the distances between our bodies are being big .
To explain it , a lot of fun I &apos;m going to have to put together some shows .
There are doctors who can be autistic by the professional committee that they &apos;re not high in medicine in medicine .
I mean to the dental dentists , I chose to and psychologists and psychologists , but especially the veterinos .
Of course , most physicians have no idea that it &apos;s harder to come in today in a day in a moment , and when we go to medicine , we learned everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , the Homo sapiens , but when we go to Medicine , we learned everything that &apos;s relevant to know about the health and the diseases of mammals .
So I don &apos;t blame the veteran by feeling the condescending of the consent and the ignoring of my professional partners .
So here &apos;s a chuband part of the veteran part : As you call a veterinary that just can only treat a species ?
Doctor Adlicking this distrust away in my passion , and I &apos;m doing this through programs like Darwin on the UCLs , at the UCLLLA. at UCLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLN : We have to the experiment that we live in our trade and our residents .
And through the San Zogen conferences , in which we invited medical school students and Veeteria to keep collaborative debate about the illness and the traffickers were shared by the human by humans and animals .
So by the San Zoeiea conferences subjects teach us how the treatment of a cancer cancer could help us as the treatment of a cancer teacher can help us to treat a better cancer of a master of child &apos;s heart record ; how to understand the gross monuments of a Nemia Shara , and how much better understanding of the stress of the sense of infant education — how to understand the challenges of the clerks .
So in San San Francisco conferences , first in the EE — and now in the whole world , doctors and veteran and the world , doctors and veteran as a colleagues , as a doctor .
And finally , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s already time that we have , doctors , and we connect the global health approach to the health of the whole species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and most humanities are being celebrated by doctors who have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways of treating human patient is practical to a lot of attention as all other other patients on the planet , grow , and they walk .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; was .
( Applause ) Giant brain DNA was like you can imagine , as you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , like you can imagine
I didn &apos;t know anything about it .
In Western cultures , when you have cucked , then you have to go through it .
Life , from a complex human being , is replaced by human data , the radicals , the doctors , the doctors , the medical exams , the list of media results — ( Laughter ) ...
Suddenly , a lot of instances in a disease disorder .
Kids start talking a sympathy that you don &apos;t understand .
They started to the blend with your body and your radicals .
People starts to change because they start treating the disease instead of the person .
You may ask , &quot; &quot; What do you tell you , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know why I am .
Do you ask the guy , &quot; &quot; Are you who ? &quot;
Are you who studying ? Are we doing love ? Are we creative ?
See , you know , &quot; &quot; What I did to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So you saw , &quot; &quot; I can change this thing in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You saw , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something I can do ?
There &apos;s some other option ? &quot; &quot; And , of course , doctors are the good guys in all these cases , because they are very professional and compromised with their university .
But they are also very used to treating patients , so I would tell you that sometimes it &apos;s a torture and that you have to become a torture and that you have to become a torture and you have to become , literally , in a patient .
( Laughter ) Things are going to change , but the typical thing is , but the typical thing is that they should be implicated in any way to know your family in order to make the risks of what you &apos;re going through .
But with all , it &apos;s going to take a lot of my hands on the hands of a very professional dreams .
Whereas I was in the hospital , I asked myself to immortize my proposal from my thumb .
It was really hard to make it , because it &apos;s not very familiar to a photo of your own .
I talked to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; All right , let me tell you .
I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , whether it &apos;s what it is , will have to face all of my own . &quot; &quot; So the next day I marched out of the hospital was saved from the hospital .
I was decided to change my relationship with the cession , and I was decided to learn more about it before it was a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , use several types of open source and information in my work .
So my great bet was to say , &quot; &quot; If you want all the information , and do it so much that you could accommodate it .
So I created a website called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; Lost House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; Lost House , &quot;
I &apos;ve had to improvising them , but that &apos;s the topic we can talk to another talk .
( Laughter ) So I had this word , &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; because in Italian , it means &quot; &quot; cubicle , &quot; &quot; and because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; query can have many significant .
In our Western culture means to eradicate or rebate the disease , but in other cultures , like for example of the Latin law , the Latino country , can represent many other things .
And of course I was interested in the opinions of doctors and the rest of the global health professional , but it also became interested in the artist &apos;s proposal for the poet , by the poet , called , &quot; &quot; No , by musicians .
I &apos;m interested in social media , I was interested in the psychological cubicle , and I was interested in the psychological stance , and I was interested in my emotional deficit .
And it worked .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; La House &quot; &quot; around the world .
I had a lot of attention to Itha and the foreign and most of the time , and more than 500,000 people realized me in a very little time through the bench , social media — but many more they were about how to heal my spouse , but many more they were about how to heal me as a person .
For example , had created by thousands of videos , images , photos , photos and artistic fictions for La House .
Here &apos;s the example of Franki Finance and his action .
Or what he did the artist Patrick LichBly : Etor or a sculpture in my tumor in my tumor and popped up in Thingia .
Now you can also have my pen !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something that &apos;s cool , we can share the same grapes .
And this was what was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors — they were all linked to me to focus .
Having all of this information and support , I have to collect a team of global citizens , traditional doctors , monsters and many hundreds of volunteers who were able to talk about the information that was really important .
We were able to make a texture of my own own view of my own peer , and as a different culture .
So the current circuit , the entire world , and thousands of years of human history , something that I found quite helpless .

So I could take my time to dive .
I had the doctor who wanted to work , I found the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the thousands of people supported me without me .
All the world felt like he could be used to help me , and this was the most important part of La House .

I &apos;m well , as you can see , too .

I used to completely my life and my style of life .
It was very intense , that was very intense , had an electrodes of electrodes to my brain on this side , so I had to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the doctor to understand the risks that were running , and then I would like to avoid it .
Obviously , there will be .
This tight was the real key to La House .
Millions of people shared their stories , their experiences .
Kids have come to talk to people that traditionally they don &apos;t see when it comes to .
I came back to myself , I &apos;m in a continuum of translation between many different languages , where science has found that emotion with emotion and conventional research .
&#91; &quot; &quot; SOCIY ACE ) So the key part of La House was struck me a part of a truly compromised society and connected and connected , whose global well-being depends on each one of their individuals .
This global agenda is my forehead .

I don &apos;t have any idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I couldn &apos;t tell you what to happen .
I didn &apos;t realize that there was something of a music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I &apos;m listening to .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before we had nothing , we gave his life to Jamire Williams on battery , ( Applause ) Burma and Christian Sports in the piano . ( Applause )
The Korean , how we call it , is a predictable space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that we would pay sacred is that we don &apos;t give us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
We &apos;re going on right now .
We have to take a lot of decisions when a Korean goes to the Korean .
We had no idea what we had to play .
So half , we did a interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; serial Boomo . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
You are all listening . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the ideas of proximity .
So the idea of a mistake , from a piece of jazz musician a jazz musician , is more fun to talk about somebody else .
The way of how to make a mistake when I &apos;m in the Korean — before nothing , we don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake mistake you are not to perceiving that is what else did .
Every &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an opportunity .
Even it &apos;s difficult to describe what would be a fun grade .
For example , if I paina color , as if you &apos;re playing with that , there will sound like this ...
( Music ) ( Music ) If Christian plays a bill ...
You see , all in the palette of color .
If it touches Mi .
You see , all of it on the inside of this emotional palette that we are painting .
And yet , if we touch the # ( MT ) Most of ears will take a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play an app .
And we &apos;re going to play on this palette .
At some point , Christian was going to add that bill .
And we don &apos;t respond to it .
See , I &apos;m going to play for a second , and then I &apos;ll never forget , and I &apos;ll talk to you .
We &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s what happens when we touch it .
( Music ) Truly , somebody might have perpetrate like a mistake .
I would only tell you that it &apos;s a mistake if we didn &apos;t respond to it .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s impossible . We &apos;re going to paint this seat again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to respond , but something like a switch .
We will accept their ideas , or not .
( Music ) See , touched his bill .
And I created a melody .
This time the texture changed in the battery .
It was a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you &apos;re not conscious , if every musician is not conscious , and you don &apos;t recognize that the company is not conscious , and it doesn &apos;t require the creativity .
This Korean is really easy .
It &apos;s a purifying experience .
And I know I speak for everybody when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that being able to rise to the Korean and making music is a bench .
What do you have to see this with climate change ?
We are all musicians of jazz , our stereotype is not the most right for the background .
( Laughter ) But I just wanted to show you how we face it .
And the other dynamics is we don &apos;t make microgenomics in jazz .
There are people who do it .
But that cleverly the artistic posications .
If he said to the band that we played so , and I want you to come back in ...
So let &apos;s see something .
One , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s a little chaotic , because I butter the ideas .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m told this way . &quot; &quot; If I want the music to come there , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more to see what I can do with what I can do .
If I want the music to come to a certain extent , the first step to me is to be patient , listen to what happens and retake something from what happens to me .
When you do that , motivated and inspire the other musicians and they inspire the other musicians and they &apos;re going to do it .
Look . One , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely different when I take my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more mature .
It &apos;s not about spreading my vision .
It turns out to be at the moment , we embraced each other and let them make creativity .
Thank you .

He wrote this to his love of love with his love .
I &apos;m going to be sincere , and then this amazing piece of these amazing talks and ideas that are being exposed to me in the intimacy here of going up here the speaker &apos;s license .
Everybody has the television .
Seven years ago .
So here in America people .
The media is over nearly five hours per day .
Right ?
Hopteen I live on television , so I &apos;m going to myself , it &apos;s something .
But most people don &apos;t like it .
They were in fact .
It &apos;s invisible , and things worse , trust me .
My mother , when I was sitting there , called the &quot; &quot; the tomato box . &quot; &quot; My intention today is not decorating if there &apos;s the good television or television television ; my idea today is to tell you that the television has consciousness .
If I think television has consciousness is because I think the television reflects it directly the needs moral needs , social and emotional policies in our spacecraft — television and emotional sentiment in our own values .
All of that is intrinsic to humans , and suddenly our idea of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good television or bad .
We &apos;re talking more about popular television .
We talk about the 10 programs with higher audiences for a 50 years .
So how that reflects it , not just what you &apos;ve heard , which is the idea of our social disability , which is the idea of our social unconscious and collective , if not also , like those 10 programs ?
How does it evolve the television over time , and that &apos;s what this sounds like our society ?
It &apos;s about the evolution of evolution , from a basic biology , if you look back into the animal kingdom , including the humans , there &apos;s four gut instincts .
It imposes , relationships , power , and the wish of powder .
As human beings , what we have to remember is we evolved , we evolved with time until we came out , we evolved with the time we had or master those pathogenys .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel afraid , compassion .
This is not just in the animal kingdom .
The other thing is human beings , we love the entertainment .
I love to see television .
This is something that differs from the animal world .
At the animals , you can take a play , but you don &apos;t have to look at it .
So I want to discover what you understand from this exclusive relationship of humans between the television and human consciousness .
Why was it evolved so ?
The imagery , the imagery , the cartoons of the demos and the host of sitting in our shoulder .
Convision works like our consciousness , trying to communicate and reward at the same time ?
To start telling these questions , we did a research study .
We gave 50 years back to the temple of 59 / 60 .
We did it on the bottom 20 of the audience in the audience , and there &apos;s thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people nearly 3,600 , and 70 years later , and we asked them how to feel emotionally .
How do you feel about seeing each of these programs ?
Do you feel a moral ambiguity ?
Did you feel ultragested ?
What does it mean for you ?
In our audience listening , I mean that this took place in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of natural needs are universal .
And second of the accomplishment , one 80 percent of the most popular U.S. programs in the world .
I want our audience to feel involved .
I want to give him the one two people before to pass the first slide : I had inspired inspired myself to think about the idea of consciousness and the tradey that consciousness can get on the day of the day , so I would donated through my thank you to the idea , Jack Stern .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to give you the data from the recognized member of Hans Bling , who you live to see .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
So here &apos;s September from 1960 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to start to start the specialist state and the state of ambiguity , that for this study , we define the puzzle as the television shows me , that makes me feel better with the world .
The moral ambiguity is the programs that don &apos;t understand the distinction between good and harm .
At the beginning , you see that in 1960s , it still stayed with me .
So we see television .
Myself , moral warheads starts to rise .
The late end of 60 , the moral ambiguity increases , and the inspirational truth .
Why ?
The crisis from the Cuba &apos;s crisis crisis , the ashamed and JFK , the movement in the United States , California &apos;s war , the Vietnam War , the Vietnam War , the Vietnam War II , and by Bobby Kennedy Learning .
Look what happens .
1970 the puzzle of the dismorse .
The moral ambiguity .
There are more , more Ronald Reagan , a television president , it &apos;s walking .
Be up to raise your flight .
But look at it , you can &apos;t say , Solomnby Irban , the disaster of Challenge , Chernobyl .
The moral ambiguity is about the dominant and the early 70s .
It takes a look at this .
This graph shows a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the happiness of it , the verge of the verge — the social command and irreverence in blue and green .
In that time in television , we have &quot; &quot; Bono , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; Andy Grib , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; Andy Grib , &quot; &quot; and national programs that reflects happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase . The happiness opens up all .
The irreverence starts to rise .
The social comment increases .
We get 1969 and look at what happens .
The happiness , the irreverence and the social media , not just locite in our society , but there are two programs in our society , and it &apos;s &quot; &quot; Goodled Payle , &quot; &quot; which in 1969 are number two and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and three three three are two and three three three and three three three are two and
What was the number one ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So the very reversible , socially reversible , Rowan and Martin Luther King .
They all invited together .
Robots responded differently .
We saw this green peak in 1966 with a tendency of trends .
When you hear the term , success is success , you mean ?
I mean to say that in 1966 , &quot; &quot; Sellers Botes , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; Sellers Botes , &quot; &quot; you know that in 1966 .
This was the first program that allows the viewers to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , my god , I can comment on what I think of the War from Vietnam , the president , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it means to say an unprecedented success .
Well , the same thing that we look at is look at what happens .
1970 , the skullulc bubbles . Staking .
We don &apos;t see television by entertainment .
The social comment , and the rereverence was left throughout the 1970s .
Now look at this .
So in a protagonizing , 70 ? Norman Lear .
We have &quot; &quot; all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
For 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs came out , seven of the 10 programs came out during the World War II .
Just a generation , in a visionary years , and we &apos;ve discovered , &quot; &quot; Are we going to do this ?
Can I feel that ?
Could it change ?
The audience , I mean , I want to tell you that the digital people don &apos;t invented the problems .
Archie Bunker was pushed outside his binding with the rest of us there .
This is another chart . With other variables : fantasy and imagination , which are programs like , &quot; &quot; gossip me of reality , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; me feel better . &quot; &quot; What do you do in the front of the red dot , the stop , you know , that &apos;s a statistic reality .
You &apos;ll see that every time the fantasy and imagination rise to rise .
We want to see programs about saving money and the stop ?
No . We don &apos;t .
What about those programs ?
Simple and rich .
&quot; &quot; Give it , &quot; &quot; the Fantasey Ice .
A huge increase of our national psyche is just going fast and tough : the stop .
Now this , my favorite chart , because these are the last 20 years .
You &apos;re either not in my place , secure that you &apos;ve heard or read about the hunter of comedy and the web of the web .
As we say , we say in this strike , the x-brand part .
The brand , the decade of humor , presumably like &quot; &quot; Furiosity , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad .
But look , the xbrand brand .
In 2001 , in September 2001 , the Roman humor of the judgment .
Why not ?
We had presidential presidential determines by the Suprema Suprema .
The staggering of technological bubbles .
The next September of September .
The railx confronts a part of the social lexicon .
Take what happens .
In the century of century , the advent reality , the televism .
What do people want people in their television ?
I would think that vapor or nod .
It gives me happiness , my world will come down .
No , they want to judge .
Power boots outside the island .
I can do that the daughter &apos;s daughter Pale .
It &apos;s going to go back again . They &apos;re exhausted .
Great , right ?
It &apos;s very different than these programs that are these programs , of pure conversation , have been there for 50 years — that was there for 50 years — that was what I told you at the beginning ?
We are animals , we need our spacecraft .
There &apos;s not a whole decade of television without an imitation or dominant mother .
In the Ancus decade : June Colebsee on the relaxed program , &quot; &quot; Leave Beaver , &quot; &quot; and Luke Beachment is going to laugh through social consciousness .
Finding Financies , the archetype of the radiant radiants that talked about abortion , divorce , even in television .
In the eighth century , it came down the way back to the form of Carcelis .
Muresey Brown vin was a victory when he came up with the idea of his mother .
His mother from this was , Bree Van .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s about a demo or a annum sitting in our consciousness , sitting in our televisions , and I know it &apos;s going to me that picture .
So all of you , women and men from TEDWomen &apos;s audience , thank audiences of TEDWomen &apos;s audience , thank you by allowing me to present my idea of television .
But I would also give me the day-to-day to the creators to keep the ideas in the morning to plague his ideas on our screen .
They put their lives on the television , secure , but you like a viewers , through collective social connectors , give life , longevity or not .
So thank you very much .

Back in 1994 came a prison in Camordian , and I met a 12-year-old child who was going to have been in the middle of a lawyer .
And by looking at the eyes of the eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that I had written with politicians , never written any letter from a letter to him , because he wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy who did something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a politician .
It was a 12-year-old boy who brought a bicycle .
What I realized was that I realized that it wasn &apos;t only in Cambodian , but that from 113 countries in the developing world , I was 93 of these countries in the developing world , 93 of these countries that were the right to a lawyer and the right to not be tortured .
And I realized I was there an incredible chance of opportunities for all of us as a world community to be able to join the tower , and then it would end the tower as a research method .
The little girl we think about torture as a form of political torture or which is reserved just for the worst , but in fact , 95 percent of the toys today are not in political damage .
They are for people who are found in retirement systems , and by deporance , put it into a torture , the tower , the torture is the strongest form of research , cheaper than having a lawyer or access , or access to the signature .
The day of today , it &apos;s been possible for us as possible for us as a global community , if we take that decision to take that decision , together and end with the torture as the research method during our lives , but this will still hope for three things .
First comes to the framework , the attribution of power and the framework of default scale .
The second is to make sure there &apos;s a temperate access and systematic to the asylum .
And the third is compromised .
So in the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we are together ?
Could we do something for those 93 countries ?
And I founded the International Breaks of Justice Justice that have like a specific mission to end with torture as a research method and put it in practical terms , and put it in practical terms in these 93 countries , forming the rating agencies in a early stage in comics .
Behind me , my early experience cartoons , and from the remembering of my first visit of my first visit , when I was in 1994 , I was sitting in 1994 , even fewer than 10 years in the country because Khear Red broke killed every day .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 years ago in the country , and so on the air , in the air , you don &apos;t just have to find a 12-year-old boy who had 12 years ago , but you can &apos;t find it , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; So we said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to say ,
The first group of defenses , and I still remember , while I &apos;ve asked me , I asked myself , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for research ? &quot;
And the room went on , and then finally , a woman stood up , and finally , a woman stood up , and he said , &quot; &quot; Khow , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Kow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And these defenses had that arose of value to decide that they were starting to defend and supporting them between them to put together these laws .
And I still remember the early cases where the 25 together were , the 25 together , her foot and the rest behind , and they said , &quot; &quot; No , no , we don &apos;t , we &apos;re doing things in the way that if they were going to be done before . &quot; &quot; But one day came the perfect case , he was a woman who sold it out of a house .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that person &apos;s going to go out to the person who brought young people in the matter , but the police came up , but she didn &apos;t have anything on it .
So then she was embarrassed . He had burned out .
And when it got his case out of a retirement , it went forward , and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence for except for the second torture under torture , and so it &apos;s going to be liberty . &quot; &quot; And the defenators started to take case over and over and over and as you &apos;ll see , and as you &apos;ll see , it &apos;s just beginning to change the course of Cambodian story .
But there &apos;s no one .
I was thinking , then , then it &apos;s just in Cambodian ?
Or do it also increase other countries ?
But in so many countries ...
On the Burma River I came up in a prison , and there was nothing for 12 years , but a eight-year-old kid who brought a mobile phone cell .
Or a woman , paste on my baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl had three years .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; which was accused of two cuers and a boo to pass onto his baby , and it was in prison .
And when I graduated from the head of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to let it in freedom .
A retirement , let &apos;s put it off . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at me , but look at my pristine . The 80 percent of the two million people here are no suns . What can we do ? &quot;
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t just the ultimate framework , but the limbs of the warmth that marked the difference .
For example , in Cambodian , what has happened was that he wasn &apos;t alone but he had to be 24 / 7 , and in the same way , in China , I always told me that , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a feoked wind in the desert when we can get together . &quot; &quot; Or , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said ,
I said , &quot; &quot; I mean we can &apos;t help to create fairy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to tell you that we can &apos;t help to create a fairy . &quot; &quot; And then he was labeled &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources has never been under the intimacy . &quot; &quot; And with this organized action , I said we can &apos;t help to create a fairy case .
So , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the
I was a little bit of it , and I decided I decided to meet another group of suns . What told me that they said , &quot; &quot; Mike , now we don &apos;t have the streets in the streets . &quot; &quot; And I said to them , &quot; &quot; Mike , we don &apos;t have the streets in the streets . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to invest over millions of dollars recently in the developing system .
What &apos;s happening then ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to take me out of the development of development , and they were forming , and it turns out that it &apos;s going to be normal to normal , in the way of defenses .
It would show me as a textbook that was actually great .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to copy it . &quot; &quot; He had all over him . Mostly it could come to the comraine .
The fission were perfectly formed .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before we all came out of the fiscal dog , I would walk out with them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , she said , &quot; &quot; Torture .
And so the key thing about it is not just the ultimate definition , but to find a way to put it in practice systematic access to the signature , because they are the warranty of the system to the people who are being tortured .
And while I tell you this , it &apos;s also conscious that it sounds like a yeah , of course , it seems like if you could do it , but we can do it in reality ?
And they &apos;re much the reason why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first of them is that the people on the ground have found ways to create miraculous , to make miraculous .
And it &apos;s not just Innomit , who I told you about who I talked to you about Cima , but also the defenators all over the world that are looking diaxes .
We have a program called Juso Makers , and we realized that there were people who were expected and who wanted to help , but how could we support them ?
So it &apos;s only a competition where you can win five thousand dollars if you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to come up in practice .
And there are 30 of Juso Makers around the world , from Sri Lanka , to Sri Lanka or the Eozoic Republic Republic , which with five thousand dollars do things , measurement programs and any way to find them .
And not only there &apos;s these Juss Makers , but there &apos;s also enough people who buy calories that are their contacts and how they can take them .
For example , in China , they gave the laws of laws that the policemen were able to infect the people who were being punished .
And while I was sitting sitting in one of our valleys , I said , &quot; &quot; What can we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we make it ? How would we make it ? &quot;
This is fantastic . And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot;
I &apos;ve talked about what we need to form and supporting the defenses .
We need polio practices in practical ways .
But the third and final point , the most important thing is that we have to commit this .
And usually people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well idealistic .
It &apos;s going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think that I think this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same opinion that has employed for the people who used to finish with slavery , or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who decided to engage .
One of our favorite poems from the defenses , that they share with each other , is saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , no value , friends , the way it &apos;s going to be long , and there &apos;s a lot of play , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not clear , and I &apos;m safe , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not alone , and I &apos;m safe , but the whole world in the system that &apos;s trying to achieve it , we could finish with the torture as
And the retail , because I know that the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a dish to talk to you about some moment , &quot; &quot; But I can &apos;t do it . And second , let me first you know what you can do . &quot; &quot; And second , let me first you know what you can do . And secondly , let &apos;s actually let you know what you can do .
I was a four years ago when I met him . It was an eight-dimensional prison prostence in Kandal , but as it was born in prison , they all had a lot of appreciation , even the gardens , so it was the only one I could get in and get out of the rexate .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s reactions . And then when Vihman started growing up , which is what it &apos;s also growing ?
What was it was going to happen by the first rehearsal , and the second and then the third and then the third one , and then the third one , and then the third one , and then the third one , and then I pasted my little finger , because what he wanted to do was to go to visit .
Of course I could never walk around the world to say , but he would want to go to the whole world , but he would want to visit every 156 .
Or if they were dark , it was like fixing and paid his fingers through .
And the most popular part of the claim afflicted that was his greatest lion and his sun and the sun , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s Vihna . A child of catastrophe .
As I was in a prison without anything , no material , but a sense of his own heroic resonance , that in my opinion , we were all born in one , and told me , &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t do that .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the only thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; And so why I would I tell you about the propeller imagination to imagine the discovery of a new world with all of us together and I &apos;ll give you this journey to us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Dying a talk in a red alertra . &quot;
To give a story of childhood .
&quot; No , a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; Remtie an inspirational director called the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not just like a TED Talk .
In fact , if you use too much these mechanisms , you look at a cliché or an emotional manipulator .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks are have in common , and I &apos;d like to share it with you , because we &apos;re listening to several hundreds of TED reports , like these .
Having with his great audiences of this audience , I learned about them the secrets of a great speech .
And yet these actors and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common ingredient .
And it &apos;s this : The main thing is : The main task as storytelling is to transfer the mind of who you hear a extraordinarily remarkable gift , a stranger and beautiful object that we call this idea .
Let me just explain it .
Here &apos;s Houdy .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s terrifying .
( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) Speep ) ( Video ) ( Music ) ( Video ) Speep ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video ) ( Blicking ) ( Video
( Applause ) 1,200 people , many of the calories never come before they feel before they feel that their brains are synchronizing with the brain of Hurary and between itself .
They are literally beginning to express the same brain patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean to say that they are going to feel the same emotion .
We &apos;re going to boose a look at the brain &apos;s brain .
There are millions of interconnected neurons in a herd .
But look here , right here : a few million are connected to each other in a way that represents a simple idea .
within the face of the entire audience in the audience &apos;s mind .
It &apos;s like , only in a couple of minutes , a pattern that &apos;s made millions of neurons in one another , just with the people listening to a voice and look like a face .
But what is an idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from a lot of ways , and these are all the ideas from the complex and analytical and analytical , because of the complex and analytical patterns .
So here &apos;s a couple of examples of commands from the TED stage .
Sir Kobson is creativity the key of the future of our children .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : What is it that creativity now , and we have to apply it with the same status .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : Elor Hardy &apos;s Building is beautiful .
( Video ) Ernest Hardy : Medra around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s elegant , resisted , resisting the remote .
CA : Chimit Adishoter - people is more than a simple identity .
Video : A very simple story of stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes isn &apos;t that false , is that they are incomplete .
CA : You know , your mind rehearsal ideas , and there &apos;s no randomly .
Be careful connected .
There are really amazing structure that is the very complex structure that is your personal personal view .
It &apos;s the operative system of your brain .
It &apos;s like navigating around the world .
And it takes millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a small component of your world is the idea that the Greeks sound like , then , in the green of the world , you &apos;ll hope it .
But if another component of your world is the idea that the lions are dangerous is dangerous , then the green is going to require a little bit different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your life look like .
You need it to be the most reliable that is possible , a guidance for the temple but wonderful world of the outside .
Now , the different visions of the world can be very different .
For example , how does it responds to your world vision when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Moohel : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; One woman of faith , &quot; &quot; an experiment , &quot; &quot; an experiment , even a sister . &quot;
Or &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; a terrorist washed &quot; &quot; a terrorist .
CA : Sure , there are millions of people out there who respond in the way that respond very different .
If they communicate in the right way , they are able to change , to change , to change the way , to the way that somebody sees the world and transforming their actions so far as the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that makes human culture .
So if you accept that the main task as a reporter is to build an idea in your audience , here &apos;s four papers to address that task : First , limited to your talk to a single idea .
Things are complex things ; you need to reduce the content so that you need to reduce the content so that you might be in love , and having the opportunity to explain it .
You have to take context , sharing examples , that real .
So it &apos;s got a sense , and it &apos;s a kind that perceives the whole of your entire talk , so what you &apos;re talking to you is that you &apos;re going to give you a lot .
And secondly , it gives you a reason to show you a reason that you see .
Before we start to build things in your audience in your audience , you have to have their permission to go into it .
What is the tool to do it ?
The curiosity .
You &apos;re curious about your audience .
It &apos;s really intriguing questions , it &apos;s caused to identify why something has no meaning and accurate .
If you can reveal a disconnect in the world of somebody from somebody else , you would feel the need to cover that egg .
And when you look at that desire , it &apos;s much easier to build the idea .
Third , you build your idea , a piece of piece that your audience will understand .
It used the power of language to weaker together concepts that exist in the mind of who you hear , but not in your language , in your language .
It starts where they are .
The relational reporter will forget that many terms and conceptuaries that invites them are completely warm for their audiences .
Well , the meals play a crucial thing to show you how to fit the pedestrian , because it &apos;s going to be the way out of the pattern , based on an idea that you hear it .
For example , when Jennifer King Kahn did not explain the incredible new biotech called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you had a text piece of text .
JPS allows you to cut and take genetic information very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic incision is like this kind of grappling moment of pension in our mind .
It &apos;s important , so much , let the talk with friends with friends , and to see that there are some more confused .
It &apos;s going to show you . This is going to show you the end : I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to deserve to be shared .
( Laughter ) So I mean , I mean , who do you make this question ?
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea will only take you to you and your organization , then I feel like it , it &apos;s probably not worthy .
The audience will see through you .
But it turns out that the idea has the potential to light the day somebody or to change somebody or change the perspective of somebody else or inspire somebody to do things like this , then you have the essential ingredient for a good problem , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
We only reject a 25 percent of what we &apos;re listening .
I promise you would promise you to hear every day you would promise to hear every day every day I would promise you every day .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ) So this cadafel , with this cacoplley goes on , is still hard to listen to .
And the art of the conversion of the conversation is the conversion of the conversion of the conversion and the art of the conversion of the conversation .
One world where we don &apos;t listen to each other by the other other people we don &apos;t hear each other .
( Laughter ) And to restrain the egg , to restrain and restraining the egg in order to restrain and restraining the egg in order to restrain and restraining the egg in order to restrain and restraining the egg in order to restrain and restraining the egg in order to restrain and restraining the egg in order to restrain and restraining the egg in order to restrain
It &apos;s about the coastal sounds .
For example , this is my sexier .
We see that hearts are very interesting to be very interesting if we get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
So imagine you &apos;re in a morning of any place of any place of America , and you think , &quot; &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s the name of the apple ? &quot;
And you &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Persone ...
This is the streets of 26 , that 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Mi . Cain . Cain is the name of that apple ? &quot;
The streets have names , the apple is only spacecraft without name between the streets . &quot; &quot; The Japanese people , a little bit confused and decent .
Now , imagine you &apos;re in a streets of calm somewhere , whoa to the person who you have next and ask questions , like this street ?
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , this is the 17th of the 17 , and that &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they said ,
The apple is .
Look at Google Mapis here . There &apos;s the apple apple , 15 , 18-17 .
All of these apples have names . The streets are only in the name of the apple .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know how to meet your direction of your house ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . That &apos;s the DVC .
Seven to 17 , home number one . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Moi . But walking up to the vendar , I watched as the numbers don &apos;t go . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , yeah . You see it . They look at the way that they have built .
The first house built in a apple is the number one .
The second house you built is the number two .
The third one is the number three three . It &apos;s easy . &quot; &quot; I love you sometimes , we sometimes have to go on the other side of the world to tell us things that we have to go to the other side of the world &apos;s things that we &apos;ve been unable to .
As , for example , there &apos;s doctors in China that believe their work is to stay .
So every month you &apos;re supposed to have to pay for them , and when it &apos;s sick , it doesn &apos;t pay for them because they think they think they &apos;re talking about their work .
( Applause ) We think we think &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of the music sentence . One , two , three , four .
But in the music of the West Africa , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot;
So you can see it just listening not only in the jacket but in the way that you count : Devil , three , four , a .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that it &apos;s going to say that for any real thing you say about the India , the reverse also will be true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so we don &apos;t forget , so at TED , that for any brilliant idea that we have or we have or listen , the other way can be true .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just a bizarre arnism .
