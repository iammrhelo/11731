( Audio ) Re@@ e@@ ge@@ m in A@@ m S@@ at@@ er , the bad man . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; So , I &apos;m sorry .
( Laughter ) I had a media family of media .
My father was five years ago when he lost his father , but when he was born , he was a man of business .
If your children were children or boys , if their children were children or boys , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , and they were going to school .
So I suppose I was saving my own savings .
Mi@@ tting mother was a pu@@ p@@ qu@@ o .
De@@ pression 16 , we &apos;re alive .
You can imagine why I had to pass when it was a girl .
They were going to be transpor@@ ted to the ce@@ me@@ tery , or the child being used to a tu@@ t@@ arian .
At that moment , when I finished the institu@@ tionary , I wanted to be a doctor .
It was meant to help women and children .
So I finally found my education , the more he was going to college .
I was in my country , there &apos;s no pra@@ ying for women in the middle of the world , even though they accepted me in medical school , couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father sent me to America .
In America .
I took my studies .
L@@ us@@ or to death was my education , Ra@@ us@@ ia inv@@ aded my country .
You know ? When I was fini@@ shing my class , I found myself , I found what I was going to happen to my family and my country .
They had months of months , and I didn &apos;t have bad news .
My family found out a re@@ fi@@ re-@@ or-@@ re@@ fi@@ re-@@ bl@@ ended bed field .
So I just finished the research , I brought my family to America .
I want you to be saved .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in A@@ ph@@ om@@ on .
Every day , when I first listened to the news , when I was following my country , I was going to go to the heart .
I was un@@ struck by going to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place to me .
I had a good job .
It was professional at a university .
I was expected .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could make it .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my own fo@@ x .
So I had to get back to the re@@ fi@@ xes .
And when I came to the field of Paki@@ st@@ a , I was seven and seven million miles a half and a half million re@@ stra@@ ined .
D@@ each , black and white women are women and children , but the men or they die in war or they were on their own . They know ?
When I was going to the journalist I was doing , I had to tell you things that I don &apos;t think .
I saw a vi@@ sc@@ eral with five kids , sitting there sitting still sitting there sitting in the way .
I saw a new woman who had no new , no studies , or not income , or a place in living in the living .
They were going to have been lost their parents , their focus and that with 10 or seven years , had to pull out their families , be their head &apos;s head and inten@@ ding their kids .
It was absolutely un@@ lo@@ cking .
My heart had changed by my people and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So that moment , a lot of a impul@@ se .
So I felt like , &quot; &quot; I felt I can do for these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m a person who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education changed my life .
He got me . He took me a position .
He had a trust . It was a career .
I &apos;m happy to pull me my family , take my family to another country , to make my family safe .
And at that moment I knew that I would have to provide my people to care and health and that was what I tried to do .
But think what was easy ?
Because , because of that , women don &apos;t have access to education .
So after the invention of R@@ us@@ a in A@@ ph@@ a , people don &apos;t care about anybody .
It was really hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; What do I do ?
Some of the states has come from the United States .
Somebody who raised you here .
They were in me ? Of course , not .
So what really needed was to win was to make it a way to trust this community .
How will I go to do it ?
I was docum@@ enting a while , I documented my eyes , I looked at me and I looked at it .
Don &apos;t ask questions .
So finally , I found a man .
He was 80 years old .
It was a m@@ ere m@@ ere m@@ there .
He &apos;s going to be his ten@@ der in the pel@@ vis and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I want to become a teacher .
And I looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Th@@ y , I &apos;m like you can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher , and I just started a lecture in the corner , and I would
So in a year , we had 25 kids installed , 1@@ 5,000 kids going to school , and it was unbelievable .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
We were supposed to do our work , forming teachers , and they &apos;re going to be the most challenging teachers , and one day , and one day , we had all sorts of transforma@@ tions . And one day , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be doing the kind of definition . And one day , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a kind of framework . And one day , you know , you know , you know , you
One day , I was in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ h@@ ab@@ a , a day , I was in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ h@@ ar , Christ@@ ine , a day , in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ h@@ ar , a day , I was in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ h@@ ar , Christ@@ ine , a day , in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ h@@ ar , a day , I was in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ h@@ ar , Christ@@ ine , a day ,
And then , suddenly I saw my personal ca@@ b@@ at to the cu@@ ar@@ box , and suddenly I saw that my personal house was the cur@@ ator , and I would s@@ wa@@ de it , and then I was the leader , being the leader , who do it ?
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on play .
But as a leader , you have to keep the compos@@ ition .
You have to keep the compos@@ ition and play it .
So I asked , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people acc@@ used in a ma@@ fi@@ ance .
So I invited them into the op@@ tics .
They lived . They went to nine times , nine ta@@ kers .
They were the most hor@@ rors men they could see .
( Laughter ) X@@ ly with a fe@@ ast , the dark , black , be@@ aten black , and you have been calculated in my office .
And I would have to sit and take a sand@@ w@@ ich .
They didn &apos;t take it .
And of course , the ton of voice that emplo@@ yers would use a lot of fear , and I was really really affected .
But at the same time , I stayed with my own .
And of course , at that moment , you see as seeing as a s@@ wa@@ x , a hair of a black sle@@ ac@@ b , and , of course , you see it , you see it as seeing as a s@@ wa@@ b , and , of course , you see it , you see it as seeing as a s@@ miles by a black ja@@ b , and , of course , you see it , you see it as seeing as a s@@ miles by a black sle@@ dge .
The only one that was going to see me was the eyes .
I wondered , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t know that school is going to be pro@@ hi@@ biting women ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And you know ? &quot; &quot; And you looked at me and I wrote , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s
They watch some students . They all learn the Kore@@ an holy book .
You know ? The K@@ oran says that if you study the women &apos;s holy book can be good wives , and you can obe@@ y their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s like you &apos;re going to go to the next bottle .
They talked about them and they said , &quot; &quot; We saw it , we &apos;re okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they know ? So I &apos;m going to please put it again and then they &apos;d put a g@@ lim@@ mer and laughed .
I was given my personal staff to my office .
They were killed .
They didn &apos;t know me .
They didn &apos;t know me to get them .
So all of these were all of the worm fires .
I was happy and , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) And of course , I claim I &apos;m alive .
But also , as we are , we still pol@@ l the Taliban , when the Taliban had the power was another story .
We were sitting in the clinic and we teach the 80 girls , 3,000 students , to the ones we were asked to leave with .
The Taliban dropped from the Taliban , we went through the country and opened a school after another .
We open up education centers .
We open clin@@ ics without stop .
We work with women and children .
We face it about re@@ productive health .
We use how many types of forma@@ tions can imagine .
I was so happy . I was a char@@ ming for my work .
And one day , when I was four pol@@ ls and a gar@@ d@@ um , I went north to North K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , suddenly a more time , and then they were given me back on the street , made the 19 kids .
With the lo@@ gos to the lo@@ gos , then blo@@ cking the road .
I asked my driver who came out and respond to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You want to go to the &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; My garage went up and said , &quot; &quot; We want to go to it . &quot; &quot; My garage &apos;s one of the left and said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t respond .
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said nothing and they call me .
At that moment , women were living inside the car .
I &apos;m very much affected by me and I mean , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
This time , you &apos;ll kill everybody .
She had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , then the moment comes up , then the whole thing comes out and what you do .
It &apos;s your heart .
I have been in your own , and you can follow it from that .
So I supported myself on a car side .
My leg trem@@ e and I went out of the car .
I mean , I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What can I help you ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Every day from one spot on one spot .
They were going to make them , and they also give them the chance to have a job .
Did you see it . What about the no@@ m@@ ons ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What about the no@@ m@@ ons ?
What we &apos;re going to do is do we ? &quot; &quot; M@@ ir@@ et and re@@ hear@@ sal , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Okay .
We know , the only one we can do , the way we can do , the time we have to make us live , is to get a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . They know what it means .
It &apos;s obviously a tr@@ a .
So I left it and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to mar@@ vel , mar@@ shes . &quot; &quot; And I went to the car , I sat down , and I sat down the driver , sat down , and he sat down the driver .
We only had money to teach them to be , to send them to school , and nothing else .
When I came to the office , obviously all the mar@@ kers mar@@ kers .
Look at your home . Nobody died .
My garage was the only one I was there , and I had a voice came out and I had no voice .
I was con@@ mitted , sitting in my desk , and I said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;re already ready to take education in the north .
They were in the after@@ glow we teach them .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly we &apos;re here talking about impul@@ ses , because at that moment , one of my wonderful exc@@ ites requ@@ ests requ@@ ests a report .
And I called me , &quot; &quot; S@@ k@@ en@@ ni@@ e ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What you &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . What you &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been di@@ lu@@ king .
It was equal to what I said , I didn &apos;t believe me , and I was asking myself questions .
Okay , so I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m going to go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , next door , you go and give them them .
He said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; And when I go , two days later , I did the same way , you know that ? They weren &apos;t there , they were not there , they were not there , they were going to get the same way , the same kids , there &apos;s going to be the ri@@ fi@@ e and the way to make the car .
So I stopped to see the car .
I came up and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , come to me . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah .
So I had the mos@@ que to the mos@@ que and to summar@@ ize , I would tell them that he had to put teachers .
Now , they are the greatest educa@@ tors .
They learn English as being teachers , learn how to be teachers and are my gu@@ ots .
All the areas that we don &apos;t know , in the mountain areas , they come to me . They go back and go .
And prot@@ ects us .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education bo@@ ils people .
When we educate people , they change and , in action , we need to work for equality .
You can &apos;t raise women and forget from men , because men are the people who read it , they &apos;re the people that read the most difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started to educate the people , because it &apos;s going to be conscious of women , knowing how to make men and that females can dis@@ charge the same jobs they have .
So we formed men continuously , and I believe deeply deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I truly believe , and I think it profoundly deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I truly believe in all these books we have continued to be really deeply and I truly believe , and I think it profoundly deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I truly believe in all these books we have continued to keep us alive and I believe , and I think it profoundly deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I
I live in a country that I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful and beautiful country .
We go all the parts .
Women had education : women were sav@@ an@@ a@@ them@@ a , their teachers , and we had a house to another .
We won &apos;t close the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of the security problem .
But we still want the A@@ ph@@ a of earlier .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now , the S@@ ho@@ g@@ g@@ a women are very , very hard .
Gra@@ doubt . F@@ or@@ a@@ ha to be used .
They were to be a doctor , again .
They were to be initi@@ ative and run the business of business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people emplo@@ ying all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share it with you for love , for compassion , for the meaning of the honesty and the honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;ll succeed .
We have a poet , Ma@@ w@@ le@@ n@@ e@@ e@@ a Hi@@ man .
He said that if compassion has been a love and if you have love , you can con@@ ce@@ p the world .
And I &apos;d say , we could .
And if we were able to be A@@ f@@ a , I &apos;m safe to the 100 percent that any can do all the world .
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Seven years ago I had a phone called the phone that changed my life .
So I was cardio@@ vascular for the U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@
I was called it was a veter@@ in@@ y of the Zimbab@@ we of Los Angeles .
One old L@@ ose is smart to par@@ aph@@ r@@ ase and the con@@ figur@@ ation of the status qu@@ ery and the ten@@ derness that was a brain infected .
I wondered if I could go to the zo@@ o to search for a possible cause .
It changes clear that the U.S. zo@@ o are told with veter@@ an equi@@ pped equi@@ pped and highly trusted that care about their own animals .
But sometimes , it would say , a medical community , especially for some specialized consul@@ tation , especially for some specific consul@@ tation , but sometimes it &apos;s going to make it , it &apos;s a speci@@ alized consul@@ tation , especially for some specific consul@@ tation , but sometimes it &apos;s going to make it , it &apos;s a speci@@ alized consul@@ tation , especially for some specific consul@@ tation , but sometimes it &apos;s going to make it , it &apos;s a speci@@ alized consul@@ tation , especially for some specific consul@@ tation , but sometimes
It &apos;s going to dis@@ charge the brain inf@@ er@@ tion of brain cancer in the case of this Neanderthals , and I ate that the per@@ tu@@ de of this mar@@ i@@ on@@ k@@ o was not mis@@ used . This is probably the case of this picture , but I ate that the ma@@ xim@@ um of this mar@@ i@@ on@@ on@@ an-@@ American te@@ mple was not mis@@ used . Here I &apos;m going to go to the heart of a house and a medical school in what we extrac@@ ted their heart .
And this proce@@ du@@ res go , which has already been cen@@ tered by many human patients , was e@@ ver@@ i@@ fying with the exception of the g@@ la@@ sty and the glue .
I &apos;m talking about symptoms , discussions , diagnostic , diagnos@@ tics , diagnos@@ tics , medication and treatments for my human patients .
And when instead , in the same day , I was visiting at U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@

We have to have psychiatric disorders , basically , doctors and the veter@@ in@@ os of the same patient in their human patients and animals , and the victims and the veter@@ in@@ on@@ a@@ hic ar@@ teries of the same patient in their human patients and animals , and the veter@@ an of the con@@ ce@@ dance of the same mental cancer , and animals , and the ca@@ me@@ tic ar@@ teries .
Well , I have to make a conf@@ ession .
I still studied physi@@ ology and biology evol@@ ves during college — even I did my the@@ sis about Darwin &apos;s the@@ irs about Darwin — learning more about the significant measu@@ rement of animal disease and human age was a touch touch of it for me .
And I started asking myself how could it be , with all of these coinci@@ ations , that never gets me to a veter@@ in@@ ary or a public consul@@ t@@ arian plan , to have another perspective on one of my human patients ?
Did we as@@ sign never a veter@@ in@@ in@@ on@@ able conference ?
But still , why should you be surprised ?
All the doctors accepted some of the biological connec@@ tors among animals and humans .
All the medicines we prescri@@ be , we take or we give our families to be born before a animal .
But there &apos;s a big distinction between giving a brand animal or in@@ genu@@ ity a disease or in@@ security that is a human animal , and that animal animal has a human heart , diabetes or cancer or cancer .
Maybe it &apos;s a part of the surprise of the separ@@ ity of the separ@@ ately that our world does between the city and the non-@@ urban .
We &apos;re talking about these urban kids that think that the normal cell would grow in the trees or the qu@@ y-@@ axis of a plant .
Hosp@@ it@@ als of today are going to turn on day to turn closer on the technology of technology .
And this creates a psychological disorder between humans that are there are treated and the patients that live in the oceans and the animals that live in the ocean , in the gran@@ le@@ ties and the jun@@ g@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason
We have the doctors and scientists we accepted them , and scientists and scientists we accepted them , and the scientists and scientists we accepted them , is just a kind of a , even more , not only a single species , or any other new , no new new species than any other .
But in our inner way we don &apos;t end up .
I was sitting there when I &apos;m going to I go to Mo@@ z@@ art or I see my M@@ ac@@ B@@ B@@ s photos that made Mar@@ s Ros@@ a .
I feel that called the human exception of human awareness , still by understanding the scientific costs of ver@@ bs as a kind of higher , part .
Well , but this te@@ b is , I &apos;m trying to try to try .
Now , when I see the human patient , I always ask myself , &quot; What do doctors know ? &quot; &quot; So what do doctors do about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
How could it take better to my patient if you saw a human animal , and more of it , would you take better to my patient &apos;s patient if you saw a human animal ?
And here some examples of the subjects are connection to the connections that made me kind of a reasonable kind of interest .
It &apos;s just induc@@ ed heart disease .
There are in the year 2000 , the human car@@ d@@ ers &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The
It was description in a sec@@ rec@@ y father to the game that has lost the savings of the entire life of life on a star@@ ve of a abandoned air .
But it turns out that the new human diagnosis is not new and excl@@ usive .
The veter@@ in@@ os had been diagnosed with inst@@ ances , treating them and even predic@@ ts emotionally induc@@ ted in animals , from the mid-@@ 199@@ 0s .
How many human lives could save themselves if this veter@@ in@@ ary rate was going to be the dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate of the patho@@ logist &apos;s patient and the car@@ ologists ?
They are still .
Some human patients are sever@@ ely .
They &apos;re used to be cut .
Some patients also have to do it themselves .
There are after@@ ward that live in the way that they live in a way , and again , they &apos;re saving them as well .
But the veter@@ in@@ os are very specific shapes and effective and effective ways of treating and even auti@@ stic people like this .
It should not be that veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge of psychop@@ ath@@ ic psychop@@ a@@ ot@@ ers , parents and patients who fight with the authenti@@ therap@@ tions of the authenti@@ therap@@ tion ?
It sent pos@@ session and psych@@ osis of pos@@ session .
Sometimes , the little bit about giving a few women hun@@ t in their hair , sometimes in severe psycho@@ tic , and even in psycho@@ tic states .
They can decline to dec@@ or@@ ate their own child &apos;s own , and in extreme cases , we can decline to re@@ ject it .
The ca@@ m@@ els of ca@@ b@@ es know also that when once a cow , a little bit after the time , it can vibr@@ ate its cop@@ i@@ le , and we den@@ i@@ ol@@ ate the al@@ mo@@ d and in some cases , like the air , and in some cases , patho@@ gen@@ s to kill .
But the veter@@ in@@ ese the ide@@ bles are going to address this particular slide of the poli@@ ce@@ -@@ cop@@ i@@ le syndrome .
oxytocin is the r@@ ots of crossing , and it causes the e@@ av@@ es@@ -@@ tor@@ ded en@@ ri@@ ble .
It should not be this information by ob@@ ser@@ vers of ob@@ ser@@ vers and Vic@@ t@@ ologists , from family physici@@ ans and the patients who are going to have to have the assumption and the psychop@@ a@@ thetic psychop@@ a@@ ths ?
Most of the promising estimates that this is all the way , the distr@@ ust between our bodies are being large .
To explain it , a lot of me have to put out some of the evidence that I &apos;m going to put together some of the evidence .
There are doctors who can be auti@@ stic by the professional professional speaker who are not high , but they are not just un@@ certain the other places in medicine .
I mean to the d@@ enti@@ sts , I chose to the dental and psychologists and psychologists , but especially the veter@@ in@@ os .
Of course , most doctors don &apos;t have a sense of that it &apos;s harder to get it in today in a moment of an E@@ ter@@ na@@ ire of E@@ ve of an E@@ ter@@ ia , and when we go to Me@@ dic@@ ine , we learned everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , the Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens . But the veter@@ in@@ os we learned about health and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the veter@@ in@@ ent to the veter@@ an of the con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding and ignor@@ ing of my professional fellow .
Here &apos;s a ch@@ ub@@ and of the veter@@ in@@ on@@ ian part : As if you call a veter@@ an that only knows how to treat a species ?
D@@ oc@@ tor Ad@@ e@@ ming this distr@@ ust away in my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through programs like Darwin on the U@@ C@@ L@@ s , at U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ A. at the U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ A. O@@ A. where we in@@ ject the experiment in animals and the evolution of evolution and our residents in our residents of our own back@@ grounds .
And through the Ze@@ om@@ al@@ i@@ qu@@ i@@ qu@@ City confer@@ ences , we were invited to the medical school of M@@ om@@ e@@ a and V@@ e@@ ter@@ a to keep collaborative and re@@ stra@@ ints of the shared and the trauma of shared by human patients and animals .
So by the San Z@@ o@@ e@@ i@@ qu@@ i@@ ans confer@@ enced subjects to learn how to treatment for cancer a cancer cancer can help us to treat cancer as a scientist &apos;s heart of a master of child &apos;s experience ; how to understand the hum@@ ility and the very best way to the treatment of the stress of the cloud of child education ; how to understand the hum@@ ility poli@@ cing of a speech , which has been going to fit in the beginning of the cl@@ er@@ ks .
So in San Z@@ o@@ gen confer@@ ences , first in the E@@ E — and now all the world , doctors and veter@@ an and in@@ forma@@ tions they were given their active and predic@@ ts like colleagues , like a doctor .
In the end , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s already time that we have , doctors , and we &apos;re un@@ aware of the veter@@ in@@ as in a health approach to the health of the species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and most hum@@ ani@@ ties are being pra@@ ying by doctors who have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways of treating human patient is practical to a lot of attention as every other other patient on the planet , grow , and they walk .
Thank you very much .

It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here the word &quot; &quot; the key &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; was . &quot; &quot; U@@ f@@ f !
( Applause ) To the brain brain , as you can imagine , you can imagine , and that &apos;s a brain cancer .
I didn &apos;t know anything about the c@@ ination .
In Western cultures , when you have a c@@ us@@ -@@ , you have to get c@@ us@@ s@@ up , and when you have to go through the Western cultures , when you have to get c@@ us@@ s@@ up , then when you have to go through , you &apos;ll be scan@@ ning , and when you have a cow , when you have to go through , you &apos;ll be scan@@ ning , and when you have a cow , when you have to go through , you &apos;ll be scan@@ ning , and when you
Life , from a complex human being , is replaced by data , the radic@@ als , the doctors , the doctors , the doctors , the medical tests , the list of media , the media , the standard of the lab , the can@@ dy list , the standard of the lab , the can@@ dy list , the standard of the lab , the can@@ dy list , the standard of the lab , the can@@ dy list , the standard of the lab , the can@@ dy list , the standard of the lab ,
Suddenly , it &apos;s a disease that &apos;s emplo@@ yed in a disease disorder .
Kids start talking a symp@@ athy that you don &apos;t understand .
They started to the bl@@ end with your body and the radi@@ ology .
People starts changing too too because they start treating the disease instead of the person .
You may ask , &quot; &quot; What you asked ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot;
Could I ask the guy who &apos;s like — &quot; &quot; I Are you who working with a c@@ us@@ er ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like to do that , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m like to work with the guy &apos;s who &apos;s who — who &apos;s who ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m like to work with the guy &apos;s who &apos;s who — who &apos;s who ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I mean
Are you who studying ? Are we doing love ? Are we creative ?
You saw , &quot; &quot; What I did to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Pi@@ ano P@@ ele@@ tor ) ( Laughter ) We saw , &quot; &quot; I can change this thing in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You saw , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something that can do ?
There &apos;s some other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the good guys in all these cases , because they &apos;re very professional and comprom@@ ised with their university .
But they are also too used to treating patients , so I would tell you sometimes , and I would say , literally , you know , a tor@@ ture of a book . &quot; &quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly means that we are not used to treat it , and that &apos;s a kind of a kind of pro@@ gen@@ y .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical is that they avoid it in any way to know your situation , to make a difference in your family and friends or teach some way to modi@@ fy your lifestyle , to mini@@ mize the risks of what you &apos;re going to pass .
But with all , this way , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re going to pick up in your hands from a very professional dog .
Wher@@ eas I was in the hospital , I asked myself to im@@ pe@@ de my th@@ umb from my c@@ us@@ c@@ er .
It was really hard to get it , because it &apos;s not very familiar to me to your own .
I talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m okay , I don &apos;t tell me .
I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , whether it &apos;s what it &apos;s like to walk around my whole . &quot; &quot; So the next day I mar@@ ched out of the hospital was the very specific one of medical pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors to recomm@@ end@@ ation of medical pros@@ the@@ tics .
I was decided to change my relationship with the c@@ us@@ c@@ er and I was to learn more about it before it was a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , use a lot of technology , open and open-@@ information in my work .
So my great bet was , &quot; &quot; How much else do I bet is that all the data , and it &apos;s just so that that any way that you could ac@@ comp@@ lish the .
So I created a web , called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve had to improvi@@ sing them , but that &apos;s the topic of this topic .
( Laughter ) E@@ h@@ ey this word , &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; because it was Italian , because in Italian , it means &quot; &quot; whose &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the C@@ as@@ tic &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; can have many different numbers .
In our Western culture means it &apos;s improved or to re@@ ce@@ de the disease , but other cultures differently like for example of As@@ k , of the Latin American country , of the Latin American countries , can represent many other things .
And of course I was interested in the opinion of medical health and the rest of the global health professional , but it also became interesting that the pro@@ xim@@ ity of the artist &apos;s leading , poet , &quot; &quot; why not , by musicians .
I &apos;m interested in social media , interesting to me the psychological sc@@ ope , I &apos;m interested in the psychological sc@@ aling , I &apos;m interested in the emotional class , I &apos;m interested in the kind of emotional de@@ fic@@ it .
And it worked .
The place &quot; &quot; L@@ a House &quot; &quot; has come around the world .
I had a lot of attention to I@@ th@@ a and the weird and the fourth and more 5@@ 00,000 people in the conversation in a very little time through the ben@@ ch , social media — most of the time , and most of them were con@@ c@@ uc@@ ked by how to heal my sp@@ ouse , but many more they were about how to heal their hair .
For example , they had created by thousands of videos , images , photos and artistic represen@@ tations of artistic fic@@ tions to L@@ a House .
We have here the example of Frank@@ i Fin@@ ance and his action .
Or what he did the artist P@@ atri@@ ck L@@ ic@@ h@@ t@@ ty : El@@ abor@@ atory , a sculpture in my tumor and p@@ opped up in T@@ h@@ in@@ gi@@ a in T@@ h@@ in@@ gi@@ a .
Now you can also have my c@@ uc@@ king !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something that &apos;s cool , you can share the same grap@@ pling .
And this was what I was thinking : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors — they were all linked to me to focus on .
So all of this information and support , I have to raise a team of a team of genetically modi@@ fied doctors , traditional doctors , mon@@ sters and many hundreds of volunteers who were able to talk about the information that was very important .
We can actually get a tex@@ ture of my own own own cu@@ bic tex@@ ts of my own , and as a different culture .
So the current circuit of the world , the way we have and thousands of years of human history , is that it &apos;s a way that I found a lot of helpl@@ ess .
&#91; &quot; &quot; M@@ all . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
So I could take my time to get it .
I had the doctor who wanted to work , I had to work , I had the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the thousands of people supported me without me .
All the world felt like he could be un@@ healthy to help me , and this was the most important part of L@@ a C@@ as@@ ist .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m well , as you can see , too .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) So I played great news about surgery : I have — I — it &apos;s — a very big news , which is a kind of a good thing that &apos;s not cre@@ asing it .
I used to completely my life and my style of life .
It was very intense , it was very intense , had an electro@@ des , had an electro@@ des , had an electro@@ des of the connected of the connected brain that the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to analyze this map with the doctor to understand the risks that would take and then be some that would like to avoid .
Obviously , there &apos;s no way .
This ti@@ ght was the real key to L@@ a C@@ as@@ o .
Mil@@ lions of people shared their stories , their experience .
Kids have come to talk to people that they &apos;re used to do not have to see when it comes to the bottom .
I &apos;ve created myself myself , I &apos;m in a continu@@ um of translation between many different languages , where science has found that emotion with emotion and in@@ conventional research .
&#91; S@@ O@@ C@@ I@@ Y L@@ I@@ Y L@@ M@@ A@@ K@@ A@@ O@@ S &#93; ( L@@ a C@@ era ) And the key part of L@@ a House was felt part of a truly limited society and connected , and connected , whose global well-being depends on each of their individu@@ als .
This world agenda is my fore@@ head .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have any idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I couldn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s going on .
I didn &apos;t realize that there was something that was going to be a music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with that I &apos;m listening to the next one , and I think I &apos;m going to start with that I &apos;m listening .
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Well before nothing , we gave the life to J@@ am@@ ire Wil@@ d@@ ens on the battery , ( Applause ) Bur@@ ma , the bottom , ( Applause ) and Ch@@ ris@@ l@@ an S@@ up@@ er in the piano , ( Applause ) and Ch@@ ris@@ l@@ an S@@ up@@ er in the night , ( Applause ) and Ch@@ ris@@ l@@ an S@@ up@@ er in the night , ( Applause ) and Ch@@ ris@@ l@@ an S@@ up@@ er in the night , ( Applause
The Kore@@ an , how we call it , is a very interesting space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that we would pay sacred is that we don &apos;t give us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
They &apos;re going on right now .
There are a lot of decisions when a Kore@@ an goes to the Kore@@ an .
We had no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
So the middle one , we did a interpre@@ tation of a song called &quot; &quot; Th@@ y Bo@@ om@@ o . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
You all hear . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the ideas of pro@@ xim@@ ity .
So the idea of a mistake : from a piece of ja@@ zz mus@@ ician &apos;s perspective , it &apos;s more time to talk about the error of the person .
The way you make it make a mistake when I &apos;m in the Kore@@ an , before nothing , you don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake mistake that they &apos;re not to percei@@ ving that is what else did .
Every &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in the ja@@ zz .
Even hard I describe what would be a fun grade .
For example , if I pain@@ a color , like you &apos;re playing with the pal@@ ette , there would be dre@@ ad like this ...
( Music ) If you have a piece of music — like F@@ a . ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music )
You see , all of the tom@@ ato in the face of color .
If it tou@@ ches M@@ i .
You see , all of the inside of this emotional pal@@ ette that we &apos;re painting on .
But if you take me to # ( S@@ oph@@ on ) Most of ears have come up to the right one .
You &apos;re going to see a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this pal@@ ette .
I mean , they &apos;re Christi@@ an , they &apos;re going to add that bill .
And we don &apos;t re@@ respond .
I saw it at a second , and then I &apos;m going to talk to you , and I &apos;ll talk to you , and I &apos;ll talk to you .
We &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s what happens when we touch it with this pal@@ ette .
( Music ) D@@ cep@@ ture , somebody might have perpe@@ tr@@ ate like a mistake .
I would only tell you that it &apos;s a mistake if we didn &apos;t react in it .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s impossible . We &apos;re going to paint this back .
He will play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to re@@ ception it , but something like a switch .
We &apos;re acceptance acceptance , or not .
( Music ) See , touched me , his bill .
And I created a mel@@ ody .
This time the tex@@ ture changed in the battery .
It was a little bit more rhyth@@ mic , a little more intense in any function of my response .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you &apos;re not conscious , if every muscle is not conscious , and it doesn &apos;t recognize that it &apos;s not a conscious company , and it doesn &apos;t require to allow the business company to in@@ corporate the idea and we don &apos;t even handle creativity .
This Kore@@ an is really easy .
It &apos;s an pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ ator experience .
And I know I speak for every moment I say we don &apos;t .
We know that being able to climb the Kore@@ an and to make music is a ben@@ ch .
What do you have to see this with the climate change ?
We are all musicians of ja@@ zz , our stere@@ otyp@@ es is not the most right for the world .
( Laughter ) But I just wanted to show you how we face it .
And the other dynamics is we don &apos;t make micro@@ gen@@ om@@ ics in the ja@@ zz .
There are people who do it .
But that &apos;s true , the very artistic fic@@ tional probability .
If I said to the band that we played so , I want you to dream that , and I want to go into ...
So let &apos;s take something , let &apos;s take something .
One , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit hun@@ ter because I can &apos;t get my ideas .
I mean , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to come forward . &quot; &quot; If I want the music to go out , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more to see what I can do with what I can do .
If I want to make music to a certain extent of int@@ on@@ mental , the first step to me is to be patient , listen to what happens and re@@ take something from what happens next .
When you do that , motivated and inspire the other musicians and they inspire the other musicians and they &apos;re going to do it , and then it &apos;s going to be doing it .
Look , one , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) It &apos;s something totally different when I &apos;m a tic@@ ket when I was a little bit .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more mature .
It &apos;s not about spreading my vision .
It &apos;s about being accepted by the moment , acceptance each other and let &apos;s make it the creativity .
Thank you .

He wrote this to his love of love this love of love .
I &apos;m going to be s@@ inc@@ ere , so then these amazing things that are both talks and ideas that are being exposed to the in@@ tim@@ acy in the way here &apos;s the television speaker &apos;s license .
Everybody has the television .
Seven years . Be a little bit .
This in America are the ad@@ versity .
The media is about five hours a whole year of five hours on a day .
Well , right ?
H@@ op@@ teen I live in the television , so I &apos;m going to myself , it &apos;s something that &apos;s lo@@ vable .
But the many people don &apos;t like .
They were in fact , a lot of old .
It &apos;s invisible to it , and things worse , trust me .
My mother , when he was a girl , called the &quot; &quot; the tom@@ ato box . &quot; &quot; My int@@ ent is not de@@ al@@ or@@ ative , if there &apos;s the bad television or television , my idea today &apos;s telling you I think that television has consciousness .
If I think television has consciousness is because I think television reflects the refl@@ ecting concepts , social and emotional policies and emotional emotional and emotional and emotional framework in our spac@@ ec@@ raft system .
That &apos;s all intr@@ insi@@ c to humans , and then it &apos;s going to our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good television or bad .
We talk to the popular television proto@@ col@@ or .
We talk about 10 programs with higher audience for a 50 years .
How do that index to make it not just that you hear , which is the idea of our social disability and collective , if not also , like those 10 programs during the age of 0@@ 0s ?
How does it evolve the television over time , and what does this sound like our society ?
So by the way of evolution , from a basic biology , if you look at the basic part of the animal , if you look at the animal kingdom , the humans , there &apos;s four gut gut gut .
It &apos;s about the relationships , but the desire to po@@ w@@ der .
As humans , what we have to remember is we evolved , we evolved with time until we were to actually evolve ourselves with the time we were to master , we evolved with these basic senti@@ ments .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel like it , compassion .
This is not just in the animal kingdom .
The other thing is human beings , we love the entertainment .
I love to see television .
This is something that &apos;s really interesting in the animal world .
And in animals can take a play , but they don &apos;t have to look at it .
So I want to discover what you can do from this excl@@ usive relationship of humans between the television and human consciousness .
Why did I ever evolved so ?
The little little tw@@ i@@ sted kid as the cartoons of the demo@@ s and the host of sitting in our shoulder .
Does this work like our consciousness , and try to reward and reward at the same time ?
We &apos;re going to start telling these questions , we &apos;ve done research research .
We gave 50 years back to the te@@ mple of the t@@ uc@@ ked te@@ b in 195@@ 9 .
We did it on the bottom 20 of the audience &apos;s going to have been 20 years of the audience that there &apos;s been working in the world , and then we went on the audi@@ ence of the audience , and we did it in the last 20 years of the audience that there was a lot of programs in the audience .
We talk to 3,000 people almost 3@@ ,@@ 600 — ( Music ) — and we asked them how to feel emotionally .
How do you feel to feel about each of these programs ?
Do you feel a moral ambigu@@ ity ?
Did you feel ultra@@ ge@@ sted ?
What meant it to you ?
In our audience listening , I mean that this took the cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of natural needs are universal .
And second , one 80 percent of the most popular programs in the U.S. American have been t@@ all@@ ing the rest of the world .
I wish our audience are un@@ aware of it .
I want to give him a little way to pass the first slide before I would pass : I had inspired me thinking about the idea of consciousness and the tra@@ d@@ or that consciousness can get on the day of consciousness and the tra@@ d@@ or , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to give you the data from the recognized TED member Art member who you see from seeing .
Well , we go back .
So here &apos;s September from 19@@ 60 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things we &apos;re going to start the re@@ formation of the puzzle and the state of ambigu@@ ity , which , for this study , we define the inspi@@ rational programs like television that I &apos;m going to make sure that I think better about the world .
The moral ambigu@@ ity is the programs that don &apos;t understand the distinction between good and bad .
At the beginning , you see that in 196@@ 0s , the cri@@ ti@@ al en@@ end@@ ure .
So we see television .
H@@ ir@@ ther@@ ness starts to dis@@ touch .
And I ust the end of 60 , the moral ambigu@@ ity increases , and the inspi@@ rational truth .
Why ?
The crisis from the C@@ ub@@ a &apos;s crisis crisis , the as@@ hamed and J@@ F@@ K , the movement in the mid-@@ rating agency , the racial War , the Vietnam War , the Vietnam War , the Li@@ br@@ ary of L@@ earning L@@ earning and B@@ ob@@ dy We@@ at@@ tle , the sc@@ ra@@ m@@ bling of W@@ at@@ ra@@ dy L@@ earning and B@@ ob@@ dy We@@ ap@@ dy .
Look what happens .
19@@ 70 the inspi@@ rational dis@@ mor@@ se .
The moral am@@ pling dis@@ gust .
They put them , more R@@ onald Re@@ ag@@ an , a television president , it &apos;s by the m@@ ill .
In@@ side to raise the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t look at the I@@ shi@@ l@@ -@@ Re@@ b@@ a , the disaster of Ch@@ all@@ enge , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l .
The moral am@@ end@@ ination is about the dominant e@@ astern circle of 199@@ 0 until the next decade .
It &apos;s a look at this .
This graph is a kind of kind of kind .
But in this case , we have the happiness of it , the ver@@ ge of the ver@@ ge — the social comm@@ and and the rever@@ ge in blue and green .
In that time in the time in television , we have &quot; &quot; Je@@ mi@@ zing G@@ ri@@ d@@ ger , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ b , &quot; &quot; and national programs that reflects happiness .
They go to increase . The happiness of the whole .
The rever@@ ence starts going up .
It &apos;s been the social comm@@ age .
We get 196@@ 9 and look at what happens .
The happiness , the re@@ rever@@ ence and the social media , not only lo@@ oting in our society , but there are two programs two and three three programs in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three
What was the number one number ?
The very simple hy@@ st@@ ology is the rever@@ sible of the rever@@ ent of the rever@@ ent , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an , Martin Lu@@ ther King . &quot;
They all invited together .
The vie@@ wers would respond in a remarkable way .
We saw this green peak in 196@@ 6 with a ten@@ dency of trends .
When you hear the term , success is success , you mean ?
I mean that in 196@@ 6 , the S@@ ig@@ ese B@@ ot@@ er@@ on , the S@@ ig@@ ese B@@ ot@@ es , came out of sing@@ er .
This was the first program that allows the vie@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; Oh my go@@ d , I can comment on what I think of the War from Vietnam , the president , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it means to say a fairly prece@@ ding success .
Well , the same thing that we look at is look at what happens .
19@@ 70 , the sk@@ ull , the sk@@ ull , the Great G@@ ow@@ a .
We don &apos;t see television by entertainment .
The social comm@@ and and the rever@@ sed of the dis@@ rever@@ ence was left throughout the 1970s .
Now look at this .
So in the prot@@ agon@@ izing , 70 ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
We have &quot; &quot; all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In the 5@@ 0@@ 0s that study , seven of the 10 programs came up , seven of the 10 programs came up during the War of Vi@@ ol@@ er@@ on 10 during the administration .
Just a generation , in a vi@@ sion@@ ary years , and we found , &quot; &quot; Are we going to discover , Are we going to do that ? &quot; &quot; M@@ this can do that ?
Can I feel that ?
Can we change it ?
The audience that I knew I want to tell you is that the digital people didn &apos;t have invented problems .
Archi@@ e B@@ un@@ ker was pushed outside his bin@@ ding with the rest of us there &apos;s been cor@@ ages .
This is another chart . With other vari@@ ables : fantas@@ y and imagination , that are programs like , &quot; &quot; gos@@ si@@ p me of reality , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m feeling better . &quot; &quot; What do you do in the front of the red dot , the par@@ ap@@ o , the back , which is a stati@@ stic thing about the job of the work .
You &apos;ll see that every time the fantas@@ y and imagination rise , we just shine a gift from the para@@ de .
We want to see programs about saving money and their stop ?
No . In the sec@@ ular of the bi@@ onic woman , &quot; &quot; the bi@@ onic woman &quot; &quot; that would have k@@ ap@@ l@@ u a 10 in 197@@ 3 , followed 10 in 197@@ 3 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The S@@ hi@@ lie &quot; &quot; — another peak of the world of the entire 1980s , and the world &apos;s theory of Char@@ lie — another peak of control and power .
What would you do in the programs ?
C@@ am@@ ale and rich .
&quot; &quot; D@@ ac@@ ey , &quot; &quot; the F@@ ant@@ as@@ ey I@@ ce .
A much more con@@ ce@@ able is showing our national psych@@ ic and du@@ ph@@ ed it .
Now this , my favorite chart , because these are the last vi@@ sion@@ ary years .
You were either not in my stri@@ de , secure that you have heard or read about the hun@@ ter of comedy and the web of the web .
As we say we say this , the x@@ -@@ brand brand thing is the place .
The brand , the decade of humor , presu@@ ma@@ bly like &quot; &quot; F@@ ri@@ ch@@ es &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ra@@ i@@ d &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad . &quot; &quot; All right , little stop .
But look at it : the x@@ mark brand .
In 2001 , in September , the one-@@ ge@@ e , the gra@@ titude of the judge .
Why don &apos;t it ?
We had the presidential presidential of 2,000 determin@@ es by the Su@@ pre@@ ma Su@@ pre@@ me .
The status of the technological bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ates .
The next September of September .
The ra@@ il@@ x con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ate part of the social le@@ gen@@ d@@ ity .
It &apos;s just the time that happens .
In the century of century , the adv@@ ent reality , the tele@@ vi@@ sm .
What do people want to do in their television ?
I would think to go to the br@@ ing@@ et or no@@ d@@ al@@ y .
It gives me happiness , my world v@@ ap@@ le .
No , they want to judge .
Po@@ wer bo@@ ots outside of the island .
I can do that , from Sar@@ ah Pal@@ in &apos;s daughter .
I can choose to get the new tri@@ u@@ p . They &apos;re ex@@ changed .
X@@ en@@ a@@ te , right ?
It &apos;s going to be the different way that this is the same programs , that &apos;s got to be there for 50 years — that was there for 50 years — that was what I told you at the beginning ? M@@ in@@ bian .
We are animals , we need our n@@ own .
There &apos;s no longer a television decade without an im@@ itation or dominant mother .
In the mid@@ st decade : June Co@@ le@@ b@@ at the rela@@ xed program , &quot; &quot; Le@@ dd@@ ly B@@ av@@ er , &quot; &quot; and L@@ ac@@ it it &apos;s going to laugh through the au@@ tum@@ n of social consciousness .
Fin@@ ding Fin@@ anci@@ es , the archae@@ ological ar@@ che@@ type of the I@@ B@@ M talked to me , I talked about abor@@ tion , the same way of abor@@ tion .
In the 1980s , it came out to the way that the way from Al@@ ex@@ is Car@@ r@@ ington &apos;s .
M@@ ur@@ es@@ ey Brown v@@ in was a vice vers@@ a when he came out the idea of being a single mother .
The mother from this was , B@@ re@@ e V@@ an .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a demo@@ o or a host of sitting in our consciousness , sitting in our television , and I know that I know is that picture of this picture .
So everybody , women and men from TED@@ Women &apos;s audience , thank the audience of TED@@ Women , thank you by allowing me to present my idea of television .
But also giving me the cre@@ ators through the cre@@ ators that are going to be placed in the morning to pl@@ ague their ideas in our pants over these years .
They take their life through the television , secure , but you like a spec@@ t@@ ators , through collective social connec@@ tors , give life life , longevity or not .
So thank you so much .

In 199@@ 4 came on a Cam@@ er@@ on in Cam@@ or@@ a , and I met a 12@@ -year-old child who had been a tor@@ ade and I found that he was going to have a child who was going to have a lawyer .
And by looking at the eyes of the eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that I had written in political was never written by a letter , because he wasn &apos;t a 12@@ -year-old boy who was he was born something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a politician in a politician .
It was a 12@@ -year-old boy who had a bicycle .
What I realized I was not only was in Cam@@ bo@@ dian , but that from 1@@ 13 countries in the development that I had to have , I was 9@@ 3 of these countries in the developing world , 9@@ 3 of these countries that were the right to a lawyer and the right to not be tor@@ tured .
And I realized I was there an incredible opportunity for all of us as a global community for us as a world community to be able to un@@ un@@ tie the tower of research method .
The kid think we think about tor@@ ture as a form of political tor@@ ture or which is re@@ served as just as the worst but , in fact , 95 percent of the to@@ ys today are not in political damage .
I &apos;m for people who are found in retirement systems and , by de@@ por@@ ance , put it , put it into the tower , the tor@@ ture is the most powerful way that &apos;s much more research than you have a daily system or access to the signature of the as@@ i@@ st@@ or is the most important thing happening .
The day of today &apos;s co@@ ast@@ al place is possible for us to be able to do that for us as a global community , if we take that decision to come together , un@@ ir@@ ecting and end with the tower as a research method .
First comes the framework , the attribu@@ tion of power and the framework of defen@@ ses the world scale .
The second is to make sure there &apos;s a temper@@ ate access and syste@@ matic to the as@@ fic@@ it .
And the third is comprom@@ ised .
So in the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we come back to the next year , and if we come back to the next year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this
Could we do something for those 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I founded the International B@@ rea@@ ks of Jus@@ tice Jus@@ tice that have like a specific mission to end with tor@@ ture as a research method and put in practical terms of the presence of the way that research and put in practical parts in this early 9@@ 3 countries , in the neighborhood .
But my early experience cartoons of Cam@@ ero@@ dian and the remembering of my first trip to the Cam@@ g@@ a , when there was a , 199@@ 4 , even fewer than 10 a@@ .@@ m@@ . in the country because K@@ he@@ l Ver@@ m@@ mel@@ a killed himself to everyone .
And even 20 years later , then there was only 10 a@@ .@@ m@@ . in the country , and so on the air , the air , in a prison , just a few years ago , but you find it with women who are also going to say , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; And so 20 years later , I was going to say , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a place where I wasn &apos;t in the right condition .
The first group of defen@@ ses , and I still remember , while I started , I asked myself , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for research to investi@@ gate ? &quot;
And the room was ap@@ ra@@ zy , and finally , a woman stood up , and finally , a woman stood up , and he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ ow &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ ow &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ ow , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ ow , you may not want to stop the police who &apos;s doing this , because I
And these defen@@ ses had to be able to decide whether to decide that they were going to defend and supporting them between them to put together in practical issues .
I still remember the early cases where they were the next two together , and the rest behind , and they were the rest behind , whereas the retirement ones were saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , we don &apos;t , we &apos;re doing things in the way that they &apos;re going to get done before we were done before . &quot; &quot; But one day came the perfect case .
She said he was true of the person going to run out and she had to put the young men on the heads , but the police came up , but she had nothing on it .
So then she was embarras@@ sed . He had burned out .
And when it got his case out of a retirement , it went forward and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence for except for the second tor@@ ture under tor@@ ture , and so it &apos;s going to be free , and the defen@@ ators started to take case over and over and as you &apos;ll see , and as you see , there &apos;s a little bit later in the course of Cam@@ bo@@ dian &apos;s story .
But I just like there &apos;s no one .
So I was thinking : then it &apos;s just in Cam@@ er@@ on ?
Or is it just going to be in other countries ?
But it happens in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But it &apos;s happening in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But it &apos;s happening in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But
On the Bur@@ ma River I came up in a prison , there was a 12@@ -year-old boy , but a child eigh@@ t-@@ year-old , and he had a two-@@ dimensional cell phone .
Or a woman , paste on your baby , a beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Dad , your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But he wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl had three years .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because I was a , I had been charged from ste@@ aling two cu@@ ers and a iron of a walking to her baby and she was in prison .
And when I graduated from the British director , I said , &quot; &quot; You must let us in freedom .
A retirement , let &apos;s put it out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at me , but look at me , but look at me , and 80 percent of the two million people here are no longer been used to organize a system where could they take the cases .
And we realized that not only was the ultimate definition of the war@@ m@@ th , but the lim@@ bs of the war@@ m@@ th that mar@@ bles the distinction .
For example , in Cam@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ o , what happened was that he was called the first in@@ audi@@ ble he was not alone but he had to be 24 to the K@@ oran , and the same way in China , I always told me that &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fe@@ o@@ ked wind in the desert when we can get together . &quot; &quot; Or C@@ old and , and we got together . He told me , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said ,
I mean we can &apos;t help to create a fair@@ y , and then we can &apos;t help to help we have no resources to create a place , and then it mat@@ ches , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources has never been dark for the in@@ tim@@ acy . &quot; &quot; And with this organized action , we found that we can &apos;t help to create a fair@@ y case .
So all the solution we found was the definition and then , the solution , the temper@@ ate the temper@@ ate .
I was just going to I have a little bit of the original one , and I decided to get back to another group of sun@@ s . What told me that they said , &quot; &quot; Mike , we don &apos;t have police on the street . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we don &apos;t have police on the street . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have police on the street . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here &apos;s the thing
What &apos;s happening then ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I want to talk about the development of development and they were forming , and it &apos;s a very strong , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very dist@@ res@@ s in the corner of the colony of defen@@ ses .
It would show me a manual to me that was really excellent .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to copy it . The first one was that , the ra@@ m@@ sy can come to the com@@ ra@@ ination .
The fis@@ sion were perfectly formed .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before we all came to the office of the fis@@ cal , I would walk back to the fis@@ cal dog , &quot; &quot; and after a pause , I said , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ on@@ a@@ tionally . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But after a pause , he said , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ on@@ a@@ ha . &quot; &quot; And after a pause , he said , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ on@@ a@@ tionally . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But after a pause , I
And so the key thing about the key and the key is not just the ultimate definition , but to find a way to put it in practical education , to the sense that they are being used in the system for the people who are being tor@@ tured .
And while I tell you this , it also sounds like one , like a B , of course , it seems like if you could do it , but we can do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it seems like something enormous .
And they &apos;re much like the reason I think it &apos;s possible .
The first one is that people on the ground have found that way to create mirac@@ ulous , to create mirac@@ les , to make mirac@@ les , to make mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to create mirac@@ les , to
And not only it &apos;s just In@@ no@@ m@@ able , who I told you about how I spoke to C@@ im@@ a , but also defen@@ ses all over the world that are looking di@@ ax@@ es .
We have a program called Jus@@ o Ma@@ k@@ ers , and we realized that there were people who were expected and who wanted to help , but how could we support them ?
So it &apos;s only a competition where you can win five thousand dollars if you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to come in the fair@@ y case .
And there are 30 Jus@@ o Ma@@ k@@ ers around the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ ank@@ a , to S@@ r@@ i L@@ ank@@ a or the E@@ o@@ zo@@ ic Re@@ public , which with five thousand dollars do things , measu@@ rement programs , and whatever you found .
And not only there &apos;s these Jus@@ s Ma@@ k@@ ers , but there &apos;s also really valuable people who buy cal@@ ories that are their cont@@ acts and how they can get them to them .
For example , in China , they have made laws that were unable to inf@@ er@@ ish the people who were used to be puni@@ shed .
And while I was sitting there with one of our brave v@@ an@@ o@@ des , I said , &quot; &quot; What can we spread ? How would we make it sp@@ inning ? How would we make it sp@@ it ? How would we make it sp@@ it ? How would we make it to make it ?
This is fantastic . And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot;
I &apos;ve talked about what we need to form and supporting the defen@@ ses .
We need polio practices in practical ways .
But the third and final point , the most important thing is we &apos;re actually comprom@@ ing with this .
And usually people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well ide@@ alistic .
It &apos;s going to happen . And the reason I think that I think this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same opinion that has emplo@@ yed the same opinion that has emplo@@ yed the people who decided to finish with slavery or ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id .
It started with a small group of people who decided to get involved .
One of our favorite poe@@ ms , which they share with each other , is &quot; &quot; Dad , a mor@@ p@@ a , friends , the way it &apos;s going to be long , and there &apos;s a lot of play , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not clear , and I &apos;m safe , but it &apos;s a very safe , but it &apos;s not the whole world , but it &apos;s not just the whole world , but it &apos;s not the whole world , but it &apos;s not the whole world in the
And I always re@@ acted , because I know the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a dish with you at some point , but I &apos;m going to talk to you about some moment of Vi@@ h@@ h@@ o &apos;s story , which was my inspi@@ rational lesson to mer@@ el the Jus@@ tice Bri@@ dges Project .
I was a four@@ -year-old when I met my . He was a four years old , and he was a s@@ ab@@ b@@ ine in a field pro@@ v@@ inci@@ al pro@@ v@@ inci@@ al pro@@ v@@ ination in K@@ and@@ al , but as a birth of the prison , they all had a lot of appreci@@ ation , even the gar@@ d@@ ens , so the only one I could get in and get out of the re@@ x@@ ate .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s re@@ x@@ its , and for when Vi@@ h@@ man started growing up , which is what it also is growing up ?
What was it was going to go out of the first re@@ x@@ y , and the second and then the third and then the third one , and then I was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very hard , because what he wanted to do to say was to go to the next one .
Of course I could never walk around the world to say , but I could want to visit every 15@@ 6 in the world , but I would want to visit all the 15@@ 6 stuck in .
Or if they were dark , it was like bo@@ om@@ ing and paid his fingers through .
And the most und@@ ac@@ ant part of the claim claim was their greatest lion and its sun and the sun and the sun and the whole of the anxi@@ ous , and I thought , here &apos;s Vi@@ h@@ na . A child of catastrop@@ he .
I am not a prison without any material , but a sense of his own hero@@ ic reson@@ ance , that in my opinion , we all fall in a place , and told me , &quot; &quot; Well , I couldn &apos;t do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I would make it so I &apos;m going to get the prop@@ ell@@ er imagination to imagine the framework of a new world with all of us together and I &apos;ll give you this journey to us .
Thank you .

Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; D@@ ying a talk in a red al@@ er@@ ni@@ um . &quot;
&quot; Story@@ king a story of childhood . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No , a personal secret . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said ,
&quot; Re@@ ding with an inspi@@ rational director called the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not just like you know a TED .
In fact , if you use it too much of these mechanisms , you &apos;ll seem a cli@@ ch@@ é or a emotional manipul@@ ator .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks are have in common , and I &apos;d like to share it with you , because we &apos;re listening to several hundreds of wonderful repor@@ ting , like these .
It &apos;s been de@@ vo@@ id with its own li@@ ve-@@ to-@@ an ear@@ ly-@@ stage little class , and I learned directly from them to the secrets of a great talk .
And even though these rela@@ tional actors and their subjects seem to be completely different , they all have a common ingredi@@ ent .
And it &apos;s this : The main task as a speaker is to transfer the mind of who you hear you a extra@@ ordin@@ arily extra@@ ordin@@ arily , a stranger and beautiful object that we call it .
Let me just explain it .
Here &apos;s H@@ ou@@ dy .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s terrifying .
( Video ) Spe@@ ach : H@@ ou@@ ly V@@ an D@@ y@@ ck !
( Applause ) 1,@@ 200 people , many of the cal@@ ories never come before they feel before they feel that their brains are syn@@ chron@@ izing with the brain of H@@ ou@@ dy and between itself .
They literally start to express the same patterns of brain cells .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they &apos;re going to sit in the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to bo@@ il a look at the brain &apos;s brain to the back of the back .
There are millions of inter@@ connected neurons in a en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed .
But look here , just here : a few million are connected to each other in a way that represents a simple idea .
within the face of the entire audience , I hope inside the audience &apos;s minds in the audience of the whole audience .
It &apos;s like , only in a couple of minutes , a pattern that &apos;s going to allow millions of millions of hor@@ s@@ th@@ an@@ or@@ or@@ um neurons to one of the people listening to a voice and look like a face .
But what is a idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from many forms and all of these animals , from the complex and analy@@ tical , and the very ethical and the very simple , and the very ethical .
There &apos;s a couple of examples of com@@ ra@@ sts from the TED stage .
S@@ ir K@@ ob@@ son is creativity the key of our children &apos;s future .
( Video ) S@@ ir K@@ en Rob@@ in@@ son : What &apos;s the point that creativity is that creativity now and we have to tra@@ il it with the same status .
Chris Anderson : El@@ or Har@@ dy T@@ us@@ a with b@@ am@@ bo@@ o with beautiful bl@@ rap@@ h .
( Video ) E@@ r@@ nest Har@@ dy : M@@ ed@@ ra around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s eleg@@ ant , resi@@ sting and the remote controls .
CA : Ch@@ im@@ it A@@ di@@ sh@@ ot@@ er &apos;s people is more than a simple identity .
Video : S@@ ho@@ ck@@ off A@@ di@@ sh@@ ot@@ er : A very simple story of stere@@ otyp@@ es , and the problem with stere@@ otyp@@ es is not false , that &apos;s that they are in@@ complete .
CA : So your mind re@@ hear@@ sal ideas , and it &apos;s not just random .
They are careful connected .
We &apos;re actually formed as incredible complex structure that is your personal personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain system .
It &apos;s like navi@@ gating the world &apos;s navi@@ gation .
And it &apos;s about millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a little compos@@ er of your world &apos;s mind is the idea that the ge@@ ek are like , then , the green , we &apos;ll hope it .
But if another component of your world &apos;s health is the idea that the lions are dangerous , then the green , then we &apos;ll respond in a little bit different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your life look like .
You need to be the most reliable , that &apos;s possible for the te@@ mple but wonderful world , and it &apos;s wonderful , it &apos;s a real world of it .
Now , the different vi@@ sions of the world can be very different .
For example , how does it responds to your world vision when you see this picture : ( Video ) D@@ alia Mo@@ o@@ he@@ l : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman &apos;s wife , &quot; &quot; an experiment , even a sister , even a sister , even a sister , even a sister , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right
Or &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; a terrorist washed &quot; &quot; a terrorist .
CA : S@@ ex@@ cess what it &apos;s like , there &apos;s millions of people out there that responds very different in the way .
If you communicate in the right way , it &apos;s able to change , to change , to change the way , to the way that somebody sees the world and transform its actions as much as the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that &apos;s shaped the human culture .
So if you accept that the main task as a repor@@ ter is building a sense of your audience &apos;s mind , here &apos;s four papers to address that task : First , limited to your talk to a single idea .
Things are complex things ; you need to reduce content so that you need to reduce content so that you might have to get in love with the very simple content of it , and having the chance of explaining it .
You &apos;ll have to take context , sharing examples , that real .
So you have a sense , and it &apos;s a kind of cool that it &apos;s a kind of weak@@ ness that you &apos;re going to have to tell you , so what you &apos;re talking to you is a lot of us you &apos;re trustworthy .
And secon@@ dly , it gives you to the listen@@ er to you a reason that you are doing .
Before we start building things in your audience , you have to have their permission to get it to get it .
What is the tool to do it ?
The curiosity .
You &apos;re curious about your audience .
They use intrigu@@ ed questions , they &apos;re causing identifying why something has no sense , and accurate .
If you can reveal a dis@@ connect in the world of somebody else &apos;s view , I &apos;ll feel that I will be able to cure that egg .
And when you look at that desire , it &apos;s much easier to build the idea .
Third , you build a piece of your idea , a piece of kind that your audience has to know .
It used language power to wea@@ ker together concepts that exist in the mind of who you hear it , but not in your language , in your language .
It starts where they are .
The rela@@ tional report will forget that many of us and concep@@ tions that inv@@ ites them are completely warm for their audiences .
Well , the me@@ als play a crucial thing to show you how to fit the pedestri@@ an , because it &apos;s going to be the way that the pattern de@@ gradu@@ ates , based on a sense that you hear it .
For example , when Jen@@ ni@@ fer K@@ a@@ h@@ n did this incredible new bi@@ ot@@ ech called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you had a text piece of text that &apos;s going to ed@@ iting DNA .
The dis@@ semin@@ ation of the dis@@ section allows you to cut and take genetic information so easily . &quot; &quot; Well , an explaining one of this graph is like this one &apos;s going to be a great moment of cl@@ ut@@ ent when it &apos;s in our mind .
It &apos;s important , so much , let &apos;s talk to friends with friends , and to see that there are some more confused .
So this is a thing that &apos;s going to show you , so it &apos;s going to be the final thing : I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to deserve to be shared .
So I mean that you &apos;re going to say that , who would benefits this idea ?
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea just makes you take you and your organization , then I feel like it , you feel it , probably not worthy of it being shared .
The audience will see through you .
But if you think that idea has the potential to shine the person to somebody or change somebody or change the perspective of somebody else or inspire somebody to do things like this , then you have the essential ingredi@@ ent for a good job , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
We only re@@ ject a 25 percent of what we &apos;re listening .
I promise you would promise you to hear every day you would promise you to hear every day every day you hear every day you would promise you every day you would promise you every day you hear every day you hear every day you would promise you every day you hear every day you hear every day you would promise you to hear every day you would hear every day you would promise you to hear every day you would hear every day you would promise you to hear every day you would hear every day you would
( R@@ um@@ bling ) So this ca@@ cop@@ al@@ ia : with this ca@@ cop@@ cop@@ h , you still know it &apos;s going to be hard to listen to .
And the art of the conversation of conver@@ sion is the conversation of conver@@ sion and the art of the conversation of conver@@ sion of the conversation of conver@@ sion and the art of the conver@@ sion of the conversation of conver@@ sion and the conversation of conver@@ sion of the conversation of conver@@ sion and the conversation of conver@@ sion of the conversation of conver@@ sion and the conversation of conver@@ sion of the conversation of conver@@ sion and the conversation of conver@@ sion of the conversation of conver@@ sion and the conversation of conver@@ sion of the
One world where we don &apos;t listen to each other to the other other people are not just one other person in the other other than we don &apos;t just have any other people to other people .
To re@@ stra@@ w the egg , to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in the un@@ cer@@ ating power and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in the op@@ e@@ air and re@@ stra@@ ining the o@@ ily that we re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in the un@@ covered and re@@ stra@@ ining the o@@ ily the o@@ ily , to re@@ stra@@ in the o@@ dd@@ ling of the o@@ ily and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in the
It &apos;s about the hearts for the hearts .
For example , this is my se@@ xi@@ er .
We see that hearts are very interesting to be very interesting if we get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
So imagine you &apos;re a morning of any place of any place of America and you find a Japanese and you &apos;re going to have a Japanese and you &apos;re going to make a Japanese person ?
And you say , &quot; &quot; Per@@ me ...
This is the street , 26 , that 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ o . C@@ ain . C@@ al is the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; D@@ is : Well , the apple is the name of that apple ?
The streets are only in the morning , the apple is only sp@@ or@@ ding by the streets . &quot; &quot; The Japanese people are going to get a little bit confused and decent .
Now , imagine you &apos;re in a street shelter , you &apos;re going to see the person you &apos;re going to walk and ask questions , &quot; &quot; I love you , how do you call this street ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the 17@@ th of the 17@@ th , and that &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And so they said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they
The apple is .
You can see Google M@@ ap@@ ters here . There &apos;s the apple apple , 15 , 18@@ -@@ 17 .
All of these apples have names . The streets are only the sp@@ or@@ ding of the apple .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know the face of your house ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is the D@@ em@@ ó@@ n 8 .
Seven to 17 , home number one . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ i . But walking up the v@@ end@@ age of my watch that the numbers don &apos;t go to the order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , yeah . See what you were construc@@ ted . See . You can actually run the way you were built .
The first house built in a apple is a number .
The second house that has built is the number two .
The third is the number three three : it &apos;s easy . &quot; &quot; I love you sometimes , and it &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; I love you sometimes , we sometimes have to go on the other side of the world to give us a sense of the world to give us a sense of what it &apos;s like to be true .
As a result , there &apos;s doctors in China that believe their work is to stay .
So every month you &apos;re having a stick , and when you were sick , you have to pay for them , and when you have a hair , you &apos;re rich when you &apos;re a little , you don &apos;t .
( Applause ) We think we think the people we think the &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of the music sentence . One , two , three , four .
But in the music of the west of Africa , a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot;
So it &apos;s so po@@ dd@@ ling it listening not just in the j@@ et but in the way that you &apos;re saying : D@@ em@@ us , three , four , a .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that it &apos;s going to say that for any real thing that &apos;s going to say about the India , the other thing is true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so at TED , like another place , that for any brilliant idea we have or we have or we &apos;re listening , the other way can be true .
I &apos;m just a go@@ o@@ d-@@ sh@@ it@@ s@@ man .
