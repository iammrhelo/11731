( Audio ) ( Laughter ) And I wonder in S@@ at@@ tain A@@ m , the suitcase . In the name of A@@ lia , the suitcase .
( Laughter ) I have been in a middle class family .
My father was five years ago when he lost his father , but when he was born , he was a man of business .
If your kids were children or girls , if their children were child or boys , they were children or girls , and they were going to go to school .
So I suppose I was saving .
Mike had been killed 16 times .
De@@ pression 16 , we are alive .
You can imagine what I had to spend when it was a girl .
They had no women being transpor@@ ted to the ce@@ me@@ tery , or the child being led to a tu@@ t@@ arian .
At that moment , when I finished the institu@@ tionary , I wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I graduated from my education , the way I was going to college .
I was in my country , there &apos;s no pra@@ ying for women in the middle of the world , even though they accepted me in medicine , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father sent me to America .
In America .
I took my studies .
Wher@@ ever killed my education , Ra@@ us@@ ia inv@@ aded my country .
Do you know ? When I was fini@@ shing my class , I found that I was going to go to my family and my country .
They had months and I had no news .
My family found out in a re@@ stra@@ ined field .
So instead I finished the research , I brought my family to America .
I want you to be saved .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I first listened to the news , when I was following my country , I was going to go to the heart .
I gave my country back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
She was an university .
I was expected .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my fo@@ x .
So I got to the field of re@@ stra@@ ined .
And when I came to the field of Paki@@ st@@ a , I was seven and seven and a half million re@@ stra@@ ined .
Of course , about 90 percent were women and children . Most men , or they die in war or they were either . And they know ?
When I was doing the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , when I was going to graduate students , when I was going to graduate students , I fell into things that don &apos;t imagine .
I saw a living in between five and eight kids there , sitting there sitting in a way , crying out to you .
I saw a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , without a study , or not income , or a place in the living room .
They were going to be lost their parents , their focus and that with 10 or seven years , they had to pull out their families , be their head &apos;s head , and try to protect their ir@@ harm .
The situation was absolutely un@@ lo@@ cking .
My heart did not know what to do .
( Laughter ) At that moment , a lot of a impul@@ se .
( Laughter ) At that moment , I felt that I can do for these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m a person who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education changed my life .
He transformed me . He took me a position .
They gave me trust . It gave me a career .
He gave me to pull my family back to my family , bringing my family to another country , so that he was saved .
And at that moment I knew that what I would have was to provide my people was education and health and that was what I tried to do .
But think what was easy ?
Well , because of that , women don &apos;t have access to education .
And so , after the invention of R@@ us@@ a in A@@ ff@@ airs , people don &apos;t rely on anybody .
It was really hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot;
Somebody comes from the United States .
Somebody who raised you here .
They were in me ? Of course .
So what it really needed was to win the trust of this community .
How am I going to do it ?
I was docum@@ enting it , I documented myself , I looked and I looked at it .
Look questions .
So finally , I found a man .
She had 80 years .
It was a mus@@ ician .
It &apos;s going to be his ten@@ der on the floor , and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I want to become a teacher .
And I looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , crazy , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a
So one year , we had 25 kids installed , 1@@ 5,000 kids going to school , and it was unbelievable .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
Of course , we were going to make our work , forming teachers , and by the women of women , the human rights , democracy and laws .
One day , one day , I was in the O@@ ff@@ ice Foundation , a day , I was in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ sh@@ ar , a day , I was in the O@@ ff@@ ice in Fi@@ sh@@ ar , Paki@@ st@@ a , a day , in the O@@ ff@@ ice .
And then , suddenly I saw that all my little run away , and suddenly , I saw that all my little run away from the cur@@ ator and s@@ cat@@ tered my doors , being the leader , who do it ?
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on play .
But as a leader , you have to keep the compos@@ ition .
You have to keep the compos@@ ition and play it .
So I asked myself , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people acc@@ used in my office .
So I invited them into the office .
They lived . They went up , nine ta@@ kers .
They were the most lucky men they can see .
( Laughter ) So X@@ ly with a dis@@ missed thing , my black clothes , black , tur@@ b@@ ine , and they entered a ma@@ sh in my office .
And they invited me to sit and take a piano .
They didn &apos;t take it .
And of course , the ton of voice that emplo@@ yers would use a lot of fear , and I was really really affected .
But at the same time , it kept me .
And , of course , at that moment , you see as seeing as soon as the head of the head of a black ja@@ b , and , of course , in that moment , I see as seeing the head of my head by a black ja@@ b .
The only one that if I watched my eyes were my eyes .
He said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know that school is going to be pro@@ hi@@ biting women ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And they know ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And
They watch some students . They all learn the K@@ oran , the holy book .
Do you know ? The K@@ oran says that if you study the women , the women can be good wives , and they can obe@@ y their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s like it &apos;s like it &apos;s going to be good wives .
They talked about them and they said , &quot; &quot; We saw it , we &apos;re okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And you know ? So I &apos;m going to give you it again , and you got a g@@ lim@@ mer and laughed .
I had my personal staff in my office .
They were afraid of fear .
They didn &apos;t know me .
They didn &apos;t know why they weren &apos;t going to get me out .
With all of it , they all were bad news .
I mean , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) And of course I claim to be alive .
But also , as we continue to educate the Taliban during the Taliban , when the Taliban had the power was another story .
We went back to the clinic and we teach the 80 girls , 3,000 students , who we educate without c@@ es@@ es@@ si@@ zing .
The Taliban dropped from the Taliban , we went through the country and opened a school after another .
We open up education centers .
We open clin@@ ics without stop .
We work with women and children .
We face it about re@@ productive health .
We use how many types of forma@@ tions can imagine .
I was so happy . I was char@@ ming with my work .
And one day , when I was about four pol@@ ls and a gar@@ ment , I went north to North K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , suddenly the north of the road , made me 19 kids .
With the way back to the site , blo@@ cking the road .
I asked my driver who came out and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said nothing , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; What do you want ?
At that moment , women were living inside the car .
I &apos;m very significant , and I mean , this is the end .
This time , you &apos;ll kill everyone .
She had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , then the moment comes out , then the whole thing comes out and what you do .
It &apos;s your heart .
I mean , you know , you can follow that .
So I supported me on one side of the car .
My leg trem@@ ors and the car coming out of the car .
I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I help you ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Every day from one place to another .
They go back to women , and they also give them the chance to have a job .
Did you remember it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
What we &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ti@@ stics and re@@ hear@@ sal , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Okay .
So we know , the only one we can do , the way we can do , for the time we have to make a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . They know what it means .
Obviously it was a tr@@ unk .
So I left it up and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to mar@@ vel , mar@@ shes . &quot; &quot; And I went to the car , and I sat down on the car , sat down , and he sat down to the driver .
We only had money to teach them to send them to school , and nothing else .
When I came back , obviously all the educa@@ tors mar@@ kers .
Look at their home . Nobody died .
My garage was the only one I was there , and I had had no voice .
I was confused , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What will I do ? &quot; &quot; So how do I solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;re already feeding education in the north .
Some of women came to be taught .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly we are here talking about impul@@ ses , because at that moment , one of my wonderful exc@@ ites requ@@ ests asked me .
And he called me , &quot; &quot; S@@ k@@ en@@ ni@@ e ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . What do you do ? &quot;
It was equal what I said , I didn &apos;t believe me , and I was asking myself questions .
Okay , tell me that &apos;s going .
It &apos;s the whole story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; V@@ ale , for the next door , you &apos;re going to come and make them .
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I did the same way , you know that ? They weren &apos;t there , they were a little further away , the same kids , there &apos;s going to be a little further , the same kids , there &apos;s going to get the car .
So I had stopped the car .
I came back and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah .
So I took the mos@@ que to the mos@@ que to summar@@ ize , and to summar@@ ize , I would give them teachers .
Now , they are the best educa@@ tors .
They learn English as being teachers , learn how to be teachers and are the ones .
And all the areas that we don &apos;t know , in the mountain areas , they come to me . They go forward and go .
And prot@@ ects us .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education bo@@ ws people .
When we educate people , they change and , in action , we need to work for equality .
You can &apos;t raise the women and forget of men , because men are the people who read the most difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started to educate them , because it &apos;s supposed to be conscious of women , to know how the potential men have the men and that females can dis@@ charge the same jobs they have .
So we formed men continuously , and I really believe deeply deeply , and I believe deeply deeply , and I believe deeply deeply , and I believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply deeply , and I truly believe deeply
I live in a country that I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful and beautiful country .
We take all the parts .
The women had education : the women had education , women , their teachers ...
We will not close the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of the security problems .
But we still want the A@@ ff@@ airs of before .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now the women of Afghanistan are very , very hard .
Gra@@ doubt . F@@ or@@ d to be used .
They were to be patient , again .
They &apos;re going to be teachers and run the business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people emplo@@ ying all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share it with you for the love of compassion , for compassion , for trust , and honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;re successful .
We have a poet , Ma@@ w@@ le@@ n@@ t@@ na@@ il .
He said , if you have compassion , and if you have love , you have to gain the world .
And I said , we could .
And if we were able to be A@@ ff@@ airs , I &apos;m safe at 100 percent than anybody can do all the world .
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Seven years ago I had a phone call that changed my life .
So I was cardio@@ vascular to U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@
I was called it was a veter@@ in@@ y of the Zimbab@@ we of Los Angeles .
A ma@@ xim@@ um mag@@ ni@@ fying chimpanzees will wait for par@@ al@@ y@@ sis and tro@@ lls that would become a brain infected .
I wondered if I could go to the zo@@ o to search for a possible cause .
It requires clear that the zo@@ o of the United States are told with veter@@ an equi@@ pped equi@@ pped and highly trusted that care about their patients .
But sometimes , it &apos;s going to make the medical community , especially for some specialized consul@@ tation , especially for some consul@@ tation .
It &apos;s going to dis@@ charge the brain infected in the case of brain of this mag@@ ician to evalu@@ ate this ambigu@@ ous heart , and I ate that the per@@ tu@@ de of this mar@@ vel of the mar@@ vel didn &apos;t mean . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here in this photo , abs@@ ying the heart of a lion , after saving your heart .
And this proce@@ du@@ ed proce@@ du@@ res , which I &apos;ve already gained in a lot of human patients , was e@@ ver@@ ge with the exception , and the glue .
The symptoms , dec@@ or@@ ating symptoms , measu@@ rements , diagnos@@ tics and treatments for my human patients .
And when instead , in the same day , I was visiting from U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@
And I started to see clearly one thing : one thing : I started to see it clearly one thing .
The same physici@@ ans have basically the same doctors and animals , basically physici@@ ans , basically doctors and the victims of the same patient in their human patients and animals , and the victims of the genius in their own human patients and animals , in a sense , le@@ gen@@ d@@ ot@@ on@@ ic ar@@ teries and authenti@@ city .
Well , I have to make a confused .
I still studied physi@@ ology , and biology evol@@ ves during college — even I did my the@@ sis about Darwin &apos;s the@@ irs about Darwin — to learn more about the significant importance between animal diseases and human rights was a very accurate touch for me .
And I started asking myself how could it be , with all of those coinci@@ ations , who never ask me to think about the opinions of a veter@@ in@@ ary or public consul@@ tation , to have another perspective on one of my human patients ?
Are we going to have a veter@@ in@@ on@@ in@@ arian confer@@ ences ?
But still , why should it be surprising ?
All the doctors accept some biological connections among animals and humans .
All the medicines we prescri@@ be , we take or we give our families that we take before a animal .
But there &apos;s a big distinction between giving a brand animal or in@@ genu@@ ity of a drug , and that animal animal is a human , and that animal animal is really un@@ folding , diabetes or cancer .
Maybe it &apos;s a part of the surprise of the separ@@ ity of the separ@@ ately that our world does between urban and non-@@ urban .
We &apos;re going to talk about those urban kids that think that the fish grow in the trees or the qu@@ y-@@ axis of a plant .
The human hospitals today are going to turn closer and further into the cathe@@ dr@@ als of technology .
And this creates a psychological disorder between human patients that are still treated and the animals that live in the oceans , in the great@@ ly and in the jun@@ gle .
But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason
And scientists and scientists , scientists and scientists , scientists and scientists , scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and
But in our inner way we don &apos;t end .
P@@ as@@ me me to me when I &apos;m listening to Mo@@ z@@ art or I see a lot of my own photos that made Mar@@ s Ros@@ see .
I feel that called the human exception of human awareness , still by understanding the scientific costs of ver@@ bs as a super@@ ior , the part .
Well , but this te@@ ch@@ e I &apos;m trying to do .
Now , when I see the human patient , I always ask myself , &quot; What do you know ? &quot;
How could it take better to my human patient if you saw an animal animal ?
And there are some examples of the subjects that made me feel this kind of reasonable .
It &apos;s just induc@@ ed heart disease .
Back in the year 2000 , the human car@@ d@@ ers found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found out .
It was description of an addic@@ tive father to the game that has lost the savings of the entire life of life in a no@@ de in front of me .
But it turns out that the new human diagnosis is not new and excl@@ usive .
The veter@@ in@@ os had been diagnosed with inst@@ ances , treating them and even predic@@ ts emotionally induc@@ ed in animals , from the last decade of 70s .
How many human lives could save themselves if this veter@@ in@@ ary rate was going to be used by medical medical physici@@ ans and car@@ ri@@ ers ?
A@@ ut@@ ol@@ a@@ tions .
Some human patients would kill themselves .
( Laughter ) No , there &apos;s a lot of cor@@ ners .
Some patients are also eating themselves .
There &apos;s guaran@@ tors that live in a long way , and it &apos;s going to be sand@@ w@@ ich .
But the veter@@ in@@ os are very specific shapes and effective ways of dealing with and even predic@@ t@@ ances in animals that behave like this .
It should not be that veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge of psychop@@ ath@@ ic psycho@@ therap@@ ists , of parents and the patients who are fighting with autism ?
He sent pos@@ session and psychop@@ a@@ ths .
Sometimes in a little bit of giving the light some women fall in depression , sometimes in severe depression , and even in psycho@@ tic states .
They can bend their own child &apos;s own , and in the extreme cases , we &apos;re going to get the man@@ ure .
The ca@@ m@@ els of bread you know also that when instead of an e@@ ver-@@ avi@@ a , a little bit after the time , it can vibr@@ ate its cop@@ i@@ le , and den@@ ying the al@@ o@@ ny , and in some cases , patho@@ gen@@ s to kill .
But the veter@@ in@@ ach@@ ment was a treatment to address this particular slide of the police station that will increase oxytocin .
oxytocin is the face of sk@@ ies , and it causes the e@@ av@@ es@@ water to get a rene@@ wed .
It should not be this information by ob@@ itu@@ aries and Vic@@ t@@ ologists , from family physici@@ ans and the patients who are going to face the presence and the psychop@@ a@@ thetic psychop@@ a@@ ths ?
Most of the promise that this is all of this , the distances between our bodies are being big .
To explain it , a lot of fun I &apos;m going to have to put together some shows .
There are doctors who can be auti@@ stic by the professional commit@@ tee that they &apos;re not high in medicine in medicine .
I mean to the dental d@@ enti@@ sts , I chose to and psychologists and psychologists , but especially the veter@@ in@@ os .
Of course , most physici@@ ans have no idea that it &apos;s harder to come in today in a day in a moment , and when we go to medicine , we learned everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , the Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , but when we go to Me@@ dic@@ ine , we learned everything that &apos;s relevant to know about the health and the diseases of mammals .
So I don &apos;t blame the veter@@ an by feeling the con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding of the consent and the ignor@@ ing of my professional partners .
So here &apos;s a ch@@ ub@@ and part of the veter@@ an part : As you call a veter@@ in@@ ary that just can only treat a species ?
D@@ oc@@ tor Ad@@ lic@@ king this distr@@ ust away in my passion , and I &apos;m doing this through programs like Darwin on the U@@ C@@ L@@ s , at the U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ A. at U@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ L@@ N : We have to the experiment that we live in our trade and our residents .
And through the San Z@@ o@@ gen confer@@ ences , in which we invited medical school students and V@@ e@@ e@@ ter@@ ia to keep collaborative debate about the illness and the traffic@@ kers were shared by the human by humans and animals .
So by the San Z@@ o@@ e@@ i@@ e@@ a confer@@ ences subjects teach us how the treatment of a cancer cancer could help us as the treatment of a cancer teacher can help us to treat a better cancer of a master of child &apos;s heart record ; how to understand the gr@@ oss mon@@ uments of a Ne@@ mi@@ a Shar@@ a , and how much better understanding of the stress of the sense of infant education — how to understand the challenges of the cl@@ er@@ ks .
So in San San Francisco confer@@ ences , first in the E@@ E — and now in the whole world , doctors and veter@@ an and the world , doctors and veter@@ an as a colleagues , as a doctor .
And finally , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s already time that we have , doctors , and we connect the global health approach to the health of the whole species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and most hum@@ ani@@ ties are being celebr@@ ated by doctors who have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways of treating human patient is practical to a lot of attention as all other other patients on the planet , grow , and they walk .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; was .
( Applause ) Gi@@ ant brain DNA was like you can imagine , as you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , but you can imagine it , like you can imagine , like you can imagine
I didn &apos;t know anything about it .
In Western cultures , when you have c@@ uc@@ ked , then you have to go through it .
Life , from a complex human being , is replaced by human data , the radic@@ als , the doctors , the doctors , the medical exam@@ s , the list of media results — ( Laughter ) ...
Suddenly , a lot of inst@@ ances in a disease disorder .
Kids start talking a symp@@ athy that you don &apos;t understand .
They started to the bl@@ end with your body and your radic@@ als .
People starts to change because they start treating the disease instead of the person .
You may ask , &quot; &quot; What do you tell you , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; Oh , so I don &apos;t know why I am .
Do you ask the guy , &quot; &quot; Are you who ? &quot;
Are you who studying ? Are we doing love ? Are we creative ?
See , you know , &quot; &quot; What I did to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So you saw , &quot; &quot; I can change this thing in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You saw , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something I can do ?
There &apos;s some other option ? &quot; &quot; And , of course , doctors are the good guys in all these cases , because they are very professional and comprom@@ ised with their university .
But they are also very used to treating patients , so I would tell you that sometimes it &apos;s a tor@@ ture and that you have to become a tor@@ ture and that you have to become a tor@@ ture and you have to become , literally , in a patient .
( Laughter ) Things are going to change , but the typical thing is , but the typical thing is that they should be impli@@ cated in any way to know your family in order to make the risks of what you &apos;re going through .
But with all , it &apos;s going to take a lot of my hands on the hands of a very professional dreams .
Wher@@ eas I was in the hospital , I asked myself to imm@@ ort@@ ize my propos@@ al from my th@@ umb .
It was really hard to make it , because it &apos;s not very familiar to a photo of your own .
I talked to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; All right , let me tell you .
I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , whether it &apos;s what it is , will have to face all of my own . &quot; &quot; So the next day I mar@@ ched out of the hospital was saved from the hospital .
I was decided to change my relationship with the c@@ ession , and I was decided to learn more about it before it was a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , use several types of open source and information in my work .
So my great bet was to say , &quot; &quot; If you want all the information , and do it so much that you could ac@@ commod@@ ate it .
So I created a website called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; L@@ ost House , &quot; &quot; and I created a website called &quot; &quot; L@@ ost House , &quot;
I &apos;ve had to improvi@@ sing them , but that &apos;s the topic we can talk to another talk .
( Laughter ) So I had this word , &quot; &quot; L@@ a House , &quot; &quot; because in Italian , it means &quot; &quot; cu@@ bic@@ le , &quot; &quot; and because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; qu@@ ery can have many significant .
In our Western culture means to eradi@@ cate or re@@ b@@ ate the disease , but in other cultures , like for example of the Latin law , the Lat@@ ino country , can represent many other things .
And of course I was interested in the opinions of doctors and the rest of the global health professional , but it also became interested in the artist &apos;s propos@@ al for the poet , by the poet , called , &quot; &quot; No , by musicians .
I &apos;m interested in social media , I was interested in the psychological cu@@ bic@@ le , and I was interested in the psychological stance , and I was interested in my emotional de@@ fic@@ it .
And it worked .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; L@@ a House &quot; &quot; around the world .
I had a lot of attention to I@@ th@@ a and the foreign and most of the time , and more than 5@@ 00,000 people realized me in a very little time through the ben@@ ch , social media — but many more they were about how to heal my sp@@ ouse , but many more they were about how to heal me as a person .
For example , had created by thousands of videos , images , photos , photos and artistic fic@@ tions for L@@ a House .
Here &apos;s the example of Frank@@ i Fin@@ ance and his action .
Or what he did the artist P@@ atri@@ ck L@@ ic@@ h@@ B@@ ly : E@@ t@@ or or a sculpture in my tumor in my tumor and p@@ opped up in T@@ h@@ in@@ gi@@ a .
Now you can also have my pen !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something that &apos;s cool , we can share the same grap@@ es .
And this was what was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors — they were all linked to me to focus .
Ha@@ ving all of this information and support , I have to collect a team of global citizens , traditional doctors , mon@@ sters and many hundreds of volunteers who were able to talk about the information that was really important .
We were able to make a tex@@ ture of my own own view of my own peer , and as a different culture .
So the current circuit , the entire world , and thousands of years of human history , something that I found quite helpl@@ ess .

So I could take my time to dive .
I had the doctor who wanted to work , I found the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the thousands of people supported me without me .
All the world felt like he could be used to help me , and this was the most important part of L@@ a House .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m well , as you can see , too .
( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) So I was — a very bad news , which is a kind of a good thing that doesn &apos;t mean much .
I used to completely my life and my style of life .
It was very intense , that was very intense , had an electro@@ des of electro@@ des to my brain on this side , so I had to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the doctor to understand the risks that were running , and then I would like to avoid it .
Obviously , there will be .
This ti@@ ght was the real key to L@@ a House .
Mil@@ lions of people shared their stories , their experiences .
Kids have come to talk to people that tradi@@ tionally they don &apos;t see when it comes to .
I came back to myself , I &apos;m in a continu@@ um of translation between many different languages , where science has found that emotion with emotion and conventional research .
&#91; &quot; &quot; S@@ O@@ C@@ I@@ Y A@@ C@@ E ) So the key part of L@@ a House was struck me a part of a truly comprom@@ ised society and connected and connected , whose global well-being depends on each one of their individuals .
This global agenda is my fore@@ head .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have any idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I couldn &apos;t tell you what to happen .
I didn &apos;t realize that there was something of a music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I &apos;m listening to .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before we had nothing , we gave his life to J@@ am@@ ire Willi@@ ams on battery , ( Applause ) Bur@@ ma and Christi@@ an S@@ ports in the piano . ( Applause )
The Kore@@ an , how we call it , is a predictable space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that we would pay sacred is that we don &apos;t give us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
We &apos;re going on right now .
We have to take a lot of decisions when a Kore@@ an goes to the Kore@@ an .
We had no idea what we had to play .
So half , we did a interpre@@ tation of a song called &quot; &quot; seri@@ al Bo@@ om@@ o . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
You are all listening . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the ideas of pro@@ xim@@ ity .
So the idea of a mistake , from a piece of ja@@ zz mus@@ ician a ja@@ zz mus@@ ician , is more fun to talk about somebody else .
The way of how to make a mistake when I &apos;m in the Kore@@ an — before nothing , we don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake mistake you are not to percei@@ ving that is what else did .
Every &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an opportunity .
Even it &apos;s difficult to describe what would be a fun grade .
For example , if I pain@@ a color , as if you &apos;re playing with that , there will sound like this ...
( Music ) ( Music ) If Ch@@ ris@@ ti@@ an plays a bill ...
You see , all in the pal@@ ette of color .
If it tou@@ ches M@@ i .
You see , all of it on the inside of this emotional pal@@ ette that we are painting .
And yet , if we touch the # ( MT ) Most of ears will take a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play an app .
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ ette .
At some point , Christi@@ an was going to add that bill .
And we don &apos;t respond to it .
See , I &apos;m going to play for a second , and then I &apos;ll never forget , and I &apos;ll talk to you .
We &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s what happens when we touch it .
( Music ) Tru@@ ly , somebody might have perpe@@ tr@@ ate like a mistake .
I would only tell you that it &apos;s a mistake if we didn &apos;t respond to it .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s impossible . We &apos;re going to paint this seat again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to respond , but something like a switch .
We will accept their ideas , or not .
( Music ) See , touched his bill .
And I created a mel@@ ody .
This time the tex@@ ture changed in the battery .
It was a little bit more rhyth@@ mic , a little bit more intense .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you &apos;re not conscious , if every mus@@ ician is not conscious , and you don &apos;t recognize that the company is not conscious , and it doesn &apos;t require the creativity .
This Kore@@ an is really easy .
It &apos;s a pu@@ ri@@ fying experience .
And I know I speak for everybody when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that being able to rise to the Kore@@ an and making music is a ben@@ ch .
What do you have to see this with climate change ?
We are all musicians of ja@@ zz , our stere@@ otyp@@ e is not the most right for the background .
( Laughter ) But I just wanted to show you how we face it .
And the other dynamics is we don &apos;t make micro@@ gen@@ om@@ ics in ja@@ zz .
There are people who do it .
But that cle@@ ver@@ ly the artistic posi@@ cations .
If he said to the band that we played so , and I want you to come back in ...
So let &apos;s see something .
One , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s a little cha@@ otic , because I bu@@ tter the ideas .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m told this way . &quot; &quot; If I want the music to come there , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more to see what I can do with what I can do .
If I want the music to come to a certain extent , the first step to me is to be patient , listen to what happens and re@@ take something from what happens to me .
When you do that , motivated and inspire the other musicians and they inspire the other musicians and they &apos;re going to do it .
Look . One , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely different when I take my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more mature .
It &apos;s not about spreading my vision .
It turns out to be at the moment , we embrac@@ ed each other and let them make creativity .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to be s@@ inc@@ ere , and then this amazing piece of these amazing talks and ideas that are being exposed to me in the in@@ tim@@ acy here of going up here the speaker &apos;s license .
Everybody has the television .
Seven years ago .
So here in America people .
The media is over nearly five hours per day .
Right ?
H@@ op@@ teen I live on television , so I &apos;m going to myself , it &apos;s something .
But most people don &apos;t like it .
They were in fact .
It &apos;s invisible , and things worse , trust me .
My mother , when I was sitting there , called the &quot; &quot; the tom@@ ato box . &quot; &quot; My intention today is not dec@@ or@@ ating if there &apos;s the good television or television television ; my idea today is to tell you that the television has consciousness .
If I think television has consciousness is because I think the television reflects it directly the needs moral needs , social and emotional policies in our spac@@ ec@@ raft — television and emotional senti@@ ment in our own values .
All of that is intr@@ insi@@ c to humans , and suddenly our idea of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good television or bad .
We &apos;re talking more about popular television .
We talk about the 10 programs with higher audiences for a 50 years .
So how that reflects it , not just what you &apos;ve heard , which is the idea of our social disability , which is the idea of our social un@@ conscious and collective , if not also , like those 10 programs ?
How does it evolve the television over time , and that &apos;s what this sounds like our society ?
It &apos;s about the evolution of evolution , from a basic biology , if you look back into the animal kingdom , including the humans , there &apos;s four gut instinc@@ ts .
It impos@@ es , relationships , power , and the wish of po@@ w@@ der .
As human beings , what we have to remember is we evolved , we evolved with time until we came out , we evolved with the time we had or master those patho@@ gen@@ ys .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel afraid , compassion .
This is not just in the animal kingdom .
The other thing is human beings , we love the entertainment .
I love to see television .
This is something that diff@@ ers from the animal world .
At the animals , you can take a play , but you don &apos;t have to look at it .
So I want to discover what you understand from this excl@@ usive relationship of humans between the television and human consciousness .
Why was it evolved so ?
The imagery , the imagery , the cartoons of the demo@@ s and the host of sitting in our shoulder .
Con@@ vision works like our consciousness , trying to communicate and reward at the same time ?
To start telling these questions , we did a research study .
We gave 50 years back to the te@@ mple of 5@@ 9 / 60 .
We did it on the bottom 20 of the audience in the audience , and there &apos;s thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people nearly 3@@ ,@@ 600 , and 70 years later , and we asked them how to feel emotionally .
How do you feel about seeing each of these programs ?
Do you feel a moral ambigu@@ ity ?
Did you feel ultra@@ ge@@ sted ?
What does it mean for you ?
In our audience listening , I mean that this took place in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of natural needs are universal .
And second of the accompli@@ shment , one 80 percent of the most popular U.S. programs in the world .
I want our audience to feel involved .
I want to give him the one two people before to pass the first slide : I had inspired inspired myself to think about the idea of consciousness and the tra@@ de@@ y that consciousness can get on the day of the day , so I would don@@ ated through my thank you to the idea , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to give you the data from the recognized member of H@@ ans B@@ ling , who you live to see .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
So here &apos;s September from 19@@ 60 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to start to start the speci@@ alist state and the state of ambigu@@ ity , that for this study , we define the puzzle as the television shows me , that makes me feel better with the world .
The moral ambigu@@ ity is the programs that don &apos;t understand the distinction between good and harm .
At the beginning , you see that in 196@@ 0s , it still stayed with me .
So we see television .
My@@ self , moral war@@ heads starts to rise .
The late end of 60 , the moral ambigu@@ ity increases , and the inspi@@ rational truth .
Why ?
The crisis from the C@@ ub@@ a &apos;s crisis crisis , the as@@ hamed and J@@ F@@ K , the movement in the United States , California &apos;s war , the Vietnam War , the Vietnam War , the Vietnam War II , and by B@@ ob@@ by Ken@@ ne@@ dy L@@ earning .
Look what happens .
19@@ 70 the puzzle of the dis@@ mor@@ se .
The moral ambigu@@ ity .
There are more , more R@@ onald Re@@ ag@@ an , a television president , it &apos;s walking .
Be up to raise your flight .
But look at it , you can &apos;t say , Sol@@ om@@ n@@ by I@@ r@@ ban , the disaster of Ch@@ all@@ enge , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l .
The moral ambigu@@ ity is about the dominant and the early 70s .
It takes a look at this .
This graph shows a similar ten@@ dency .
But in this case , we have the happiness of it , the ver@@ ge of the ver@@ ge — the social comm@@ and and ir@@ rever@@ ence in blue and green .
In that time in television , we have &quot; &quot; Bon@@ o , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ b , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ b , &quot; &quot; and national programs that reflects happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase . The happiness opens up all .
The ir@@ rever@@ ence starts to rise .
The social comment increases .
We get 196@@ 9 and look at what happens .
The happiness , the ir@@ rever@@ ence and the social media , not just loc@@ ite in our society , but there are two programs in our society , and it &apos;s &quot; &quot; Goo@@ d@@ led P@@ ay@@ le , &quot; &quot; which in 196@@ 9 are number two and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and number three three and three three three are two and three three three and three three three are two and
What was the number one ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So the very rever@@ sible , socially rever@@ sible , R@@ ow@@ an and Martin Lu@@ ther King .
They all invited together .
Rob@@ ots responded differently .
We saw this green peak in 196@@ 6 with a ten@@ dency of trends .
When you hear the term , success is success , you mean ?
I mean to say that in 196@@ 6 , &quot; &quot; S@@ ell@@ ers B@@ ot@@ es , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; S@@ ell@@ ers B@@ ot@@ es , &quot; &quot; you know that in 196@@ 6 .
This was the first program that allows the vie@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , my go@@ d , I can comment on what I think of the War from Vietnam , the president , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it means to say an unprecedented success .
Well , the same thing that we look at is look at what happens .
19@@ 70 , the sk@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ c bub@@ bles . Sta@@ king .
We don &apos;t see television by entertainment .
The social comment , and the re@@ rever@@ ence was left throughout the 1970s .
Now look at this .
So in a prot@@ agon@@ izing , 70 ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
We have &quot; &quot; all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
For 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs came out , seven of the 10 programs came out during the World War II .
Just a generation , in a vi@@ sion@@ ary years , and we &apos;ve discovered , &quot; &quot; Are we going to do this ?
Can I feel that ?
Could it change ?
The audience , I mean , I want to tell you that the digital people don &apos;t invented the problems .
Archi@@ e B@@ un@@ ker was pushed outside his bin@@ ding with the rest of us there .
This is another chart . With other vari@@ ables : fantas@@ y and imagination , which are programs like , &quot; &quot; gos@@ si@@ p me of reality , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; me feel better . &quot; &quot; What do you do in the front of the red dot , the stop , you know , that &apos;s a stati@@ stic reality .
You &apos;ll see that every time the fantas@@ y and imagination rise to rise .
We want to see programs about saving money and the stop ?
No . We don &apos;t .
What about those programs ?
Simp@@ le and rich .
&quot; &quot; Give it , &quot; &quot; the F@@ ant@@ as@@ ey I@@ ce .
A huge increase of our national psych@@ e is just going fast and tough : the stop .
Now this , my favorite chart , because these are the last 20 years .
You &apos;re either not in my place , secure that you &apos;ve heard or read about the hun@@ ter of comedy and the web of the web .
As we say , we say in this stri@@ ke , the x@@ -@@ brand part .
The brand , the decade of humor , presu@@ ma@@ bly like &quot; &quot; F@@ uri@@ osity , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ ad .
But look , the x@@ brand brand .
In 2001 , in September 2001 , the Rom@@ an humor of the judgment .
Why not ?
We had presidential presidential determin@@ es by the Su@@ pre@@ ma Su@@ pre@@ ma .
The stag@@ gering of technological bub@@ bles .
The next September of September .
The ra@@ il@@ x confron@@ ts a part of the social le@@ x@@ icon .
Take what happens .
In the century of century , the adv@@ ent reality , the tele@@ vi@@ sm .
What do people want people in their television ?
I would think that v@@ ap@@ or or no@@ d .
It gives me happiness , my world will come down .
No , they want to judge .
Po@@ wer bo@@ ots outside the island .
I can do that the daughter &apos;s daughter Pal@@ e .
It &apos;s going to go back again . They &apos;re exhau@@ sted .
Great , right ?
It &apos;s very different than these programs that are these programs , of pure conversation , have been there for 50 years — that was there for 50 years — that was what I told you at the beginning ?
We are animals , we need our spac@@ ec@@ raft .
There &apos;s not a whole decade of television without an im@@ itation or dominant mother .
In the An@@ cus decade : June Co@@ le@@ b@@ see on the rela@@ xed program , &quot; &quot; Le@@ a@@ ve Be@@ av@@ er , &quot; &quot; and Lu@@ ke Be@@ ach@@ ment is going to laugh through social consciousness .
Fin@@ ding Fin@@ anci@@ es , the ar@@ che@@ type of the radi@@ ant radi@@ ants that talked about abor@@ tion , di@@ vor@@ ce , even in television .
In the eigh@@ th century , it came down the way back to the form of Car@@ cel@@ is .
M@@ ur@@ es@@ ey Brown v@@ in was a vic@@ tory when he came up with the idea of his mother .
His mother from this was , B@@ re@@ e V@@ an .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s about a dem@@ o or a ann@@ um sitting in our consciousness , sitting in our tele@@ vi@@ sions , and I know it &apos;s going to me that picture .
So all of you , women and men from TED@@ Women &apos;s audience , thank audiences of TED@@ Women &apos;s audience , thank you by allowing me to present my idea of television .
But I would also give me the day@@ -to-@@ day to the cre@@ ators to keep the ideas in the morning to pl@@ ague his ideas on our screen .
They put their lives on the television , secure , but you like a vie@@ wers , through collective social connec@@ tors , give life , longevity or not .
So thank you very much .

Back in 199@@ 4 came a prison in Cam@@ or@@ dian , and I met a 12@@ -year-old child who was going to have been in the middle of a lawyer .
And by looking at the eyes of the eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that I had written with politicians , never written any letter from a letter to him , because he wasn &apos;t a 12@@ -year-old boy who did something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a politician .
It was a 12@@ -year-old boy who brought a bicycle .
What I realized was that I realized that it wasn &apos;t only in Cam@@ bo@@ dian , but that from 1@@ 13 countries in the developing world , I was 9@@ 3 of these countries in the developing world , 9@@ 3 of these countries that were the right to a lawyer and the right to not be tor@@ tured .
And I realized I was there an incredible chance of opportunities for all of us as a world community to be able to join the tower , and then it would end the tower as a research method .
The little girl we think about tor@@ ture as a form of political tor@@ ture or which is re@@ served just for the worst , but in fact , 95 percent of the to@@ ys today are not in political damage .
They are for people who are found in retirement systems , and by de@@ por@@ ance , put it into a tor@@ ture , the tower , the tor@@ ture is the stron@@ gest form of research , cheaper than having a lawyer or access , or access to the signature .
The day of today , it &apos;s been possible for us as possible for us as a global community , if we take that decision to take that decision , together and end with the tor@@ ture as the research method during our lives , but this will still hope for three things .
First comes to the framework , the attribu@@ tion of power and the framework of default scale .
The second is to make sure there &apos;s a temper@@ ate access and syste@@ matic to the asylum .
And the third is comprom@@ ised .
So in the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we are together ?
Could we do something for those 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I founded the International B@@ rea@@ ks of Jus@@ tice Jus@@ tice that have like a specific mission to end with tor@@ ture as a research method and put it in practical terms , and put it in practical terms in these 9@@ 3 countries , forming the rating agencies in a early stage in com@@ ics .
Behind me , my early experience cartoons , and from the remembering of my first visit of my first visit , when I was in 199@@ 4 , I was sitting in 199@@ 4 , even fewer than 10 years in the country because K@@ he@@ ar Red broke killed every day .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 years ago in the country , and so on the air , in the air , you don &apos;t just have to find a 12@@ -year-old boy who had 12 years ago , but you can &apos;t find it , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; So we said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re going to say ,
The first group of defen@@ ses , and I still remember , while I &apos;ve asked me , I asked myself , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for research ? &quot;
And the room went on , and then finally , a woman stood up , and finally , a woman stood up , and he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ ow , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; K@@ ow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And these defen@@ ses had that ar@@ ose of value to decide that they were starting to defend and supporting them between them to put together these laws .
And I still remember the early cases where the 25 together were , the 25 together , her foot and the rest behind , and they said , &quot; &quot; No , no , we don &apos;t , we &apos;re doing things in the way that if they were going to be done before . &quot; &quot; But one day came the perfect case , he was a woman who sold it out of a house .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that person &apos;s going to go out to the person who brought young people in the matter , but the police came up , but she didn &apos;t have anything on it .
So then she was embarras@@ sed . He had burned out .
And when it got his case out of a retirement , it went forward , and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence for except for the second tor@@ ture under tor@@ ture , and so it &apos;s going to be liberty . &quot; &quot; And the defen@@ ators started to take case over and over and over and as you &apos;ll see , and as you &apos;ll see , it &apos;s just beginning to change the course of Cam@@ bo@@ dian story .
But there &apos;s no one .
I was thinking , then , then it &apos;s just in Cam@@ bo@@ dian ?
Or do it also increase other countries ?
But in so many countries ...
On the Bur@@ ma River I came up in a prison , and there was nothing for 12 years , but a eigh@@ t-@@ year-old kid who brought a mobile phone cell .
Or a woman , paste on my baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl had three years .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; which was acc@@ used of two cu@@ ers and a bo@@ o to pass onto his baby , and it was in prison .
And when I graduated from the head of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to let it in freedom .
A retirement , let &apos;s put it off . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at me , but look at my pri@@ stine . The 80 percent of the two million people here are no sun@@ s . What can we do ? &quot;
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t just the ultimate framework , but the lim@@ bs of the war@@ m@@ th that marked the difference .
For example , in Cam@@ bo@@ dian , what has happened was that he wasn &apos;t alone but he had to be 24 / 7 , and in the same way , in China , I always told me that , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fe@@ o@@ ked wind in the desert when we can get together . &quot; &quot; Or , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said ,
I said , &quot; &quot; I mean we can &apos;t help to create fair@@ y . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to tell you that we can &apos;t help to create a fair@@ y . &quot; &quot; And then he was labeled &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources has never been under the in@@ tim@@ acy . &quot; &quot; And with this organized action , I said we can &apos;t help to create a fair@@ y case .
So , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the solution that we found was the framework and then then , the
I was a little bit of it , and I decided I decided to meet another group of sun@@ s . What told me that they said , &quot; &quot; Mike , now we don &apos;t have the streets in the streets . &quot; &quot; And I said to them , &quot; &quot; Mike , we don &apos;t have the streets in the streets . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to invest over millions of dollars recently in the developing system .
What &apos;s happening then ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to take me out of the development of development , and they were forming , and it turns out that it &apos;s going to be normal to normal , in the way of defen@@ ses .
It would show me as a text@@ book that was actually great .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to copy it . &quot; &quot; He had all over him . Mos@@ tly it could come to the com@@ ra@@ ine .
The fis@@ sion were perfectly formed .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before we all came out of the fis@@ cal dog , I would walk out with them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , she said , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ ture .
And so the key thing about it is not just the ultimate definition , but to find a way to put it in practice syste@@ matic access to the signature , because they are the war@@ ran@@ ty of the system to the people who are being tor@@ tured .
And while I tell you this , it &apos;s also conscious that it sounds like a yeah , of course , it seems like if you could do it , but we can do it in reality ?
And they &apos;re much the reason why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first of them is that the people on the ground have found ways to create mirac@@ ulous , to make mirac@@ ulous .
And it &apos;s not just In@@ no@@ m@@ it , who I told you about who I talked to you about C@@ im@@ a , but also the defen@@ ators all over the world that are looking di@@ ax@@ es .
We have a program called Jus@@ o Ma@@ k@@ ers , and we realized that there were people who were expected and who wanted to help , but how could we support them ?
So it &apos;s only a competition where you can win five thousand dollars if you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to come up in practice .
And there are 30 of Jus@@ o Ma@@ k@@ ers around the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ ank@@ a , to S@@ r@@ i L@@ ank@@ a or the E@@ o@@ zo@@ ic Re@@ public Re@@ public , which with five thousand dollars do things , measu@@ rement programs and any way to find them .
And not only there &apos;s these Jus@@ s Ma@@ k@@ ers , but there &apos;s also enough people who buy cal@@ ories that are their cont@@ acts and how they can take them .
For example , in China , they gave the laws of laws that the poli@@ ce@@ men were able to inf@@ ect the people who were being puni@@ shed .
And while I was sitting sitting in one of our val@@ le@@ ys , I said , &quot; &quot; What can we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we spread ? How could we make it ? How would we make it ? &quot;
This is fantastic . And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot;
I &apos;ve talked about what we need to form and supporting the defen@@ ses .
We need polio practices in practical ways .
But the third and final point , the most important thing is that we have to commit this .
And usually people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well ide@@ alistic .
It &apos;s going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think that I think this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same opinion that has emplo@@ yed for the people who used to finish with slavery , or ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id .
It started with a small group of people who decided to engage .
One of our favorite poe@@ ms from the defen@@ ses , that they share with each other , is saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , no value , friends , the way it &apos;s going to be long , and there &apos;s a lot of play , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not clear , and I &apos;m safe , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not alone , and I &apos;m safe , but the whole world in the system that &apos;s trying to achieve it , we could finish with the tor@@ ture as
And the re@@ tail , because I know that the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a dish to talk to you about some moment , &quot; &quot; But I can &apos;t do it . And second , let me first you know what you can do . &quot; &quot; And second , let me first you know what you can do . And secon@@ dly , let &apos;s actually let you know what you can do .
I was a four years ago when I met him . It was an eigh@@ t-@@ dimensional prison pro@@ st@@ ence in K@@ and@@ al , but as it was born in prison , they all had a lot of appreci@@ ation , even the gar@@ d@@ ens , so it was the only one I could get in and get out of the re@@ x@@ ate .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s reactions . And then when Vi@@ h@@ man started growing up , which is what it &apos;s also growing ?
What was it was going to happen by the first re@@ hear@@ sal , and the second and then the third and then the third one , and then the third one , and then the third one , and then the third one , and then I pasted my little finger , because what he wanted to do was to go to visit .
Of course I could never walk around the world to say , but he would want to go to the whole world , but he would want to visit every 15@@ 6 .
Or if they were dark , it was like fi@@ xing and paid his fingers through .
And the most popular part of the claim aff@@ lic@@ ted that was his greatest lion and his sun and the sun , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s Vi@@ h@@ na . A child of catastrop@@ he .
As I was in a prison without anything , no material , but a sense of his own hero@@ ic reson@@ ance , that in my opinion , we were all born in one , and told me , &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t do that .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the only thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; And so why I would I tell you about the prop@@ ell@@ er imagination to imagine the discovery of a new world with all of us together and I &apos;ll give you this journey to us .
Thank you .

Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; D@@ ying a talk in a red al@@ er@@ tr@@ a . &quot;
To give a story of childhood .
&quot; No , a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; R@@ em@@ tie an inspi@@ rational director called the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not just like a TED Talk .
In fact , if you use too much these mechanisms , you look at a cli@@ ch@@ é or an emotional manipul@@ ator .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks are have in common , and I &apos;d like to share it with you , because we &apos;re listening to several hundreds of TED reports , like these .
Ha@@ ving with his great audiences of this audience , I learned about them the secrets of a great speech .
And yet these actors and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common ingredi@@ ent .
And it &apos;s this : The main thing is : The main task as storytelling is to transfer the mind of who you hear a extra@@ ordin@@ arily remarkable gift , a stranger and beautiful object that we call this idea .
Let me just explain it .
Here &apos;s H@@ ou@@ dy .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s terrifying .
( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) ( Video ) Spe@@ ep ) ( Video ) ( Music ) ( Video ) Spe@@ ep ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video ) ( B@@ lic@@ king ) ( Video
( Applause ) 1,@@ 200 people , many of the cal@@ ories never come before they feel before they feel that their brains are syn@@ chron@@ izing with the brain of H@@ ur@@ ary and between itself .
They are literally beginning to express the same brain patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean to say that they are going to feel the same emotion .
We &apos;re going to bo@@ ose a look at the brain &apos;s brain .
There are millions of inter@@ connected neurons in a her@@ d .
But look here , right here : a few million are connected to each other in a way that represents a simple idea .
within the face of the entire audience in the audience &apos;s mind .
It &apos;s like , only in a couple of minutes , a pattern that &apos;s made millions of neurons in one another , just with the people listening to a voice and look like a face .
But what is an idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from a lot of ways , and these are all the ideas from the complex and analy@@ tical and analy@@ tical , because of the complex and analy@@ tical patterns .
So here &apos;s a couple of examples of comm@@ ands from the TED stage .
S@@ ir K@@ ob@@ son is creativity the key of the future of our children .
( Video ) S@@ ir K@@ en Rob@@ in@@ son : What is it that creativity now , and we have to apply it with the same status .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : El@@ or Har@@ dy &apos;s Buil@@ ding is beautiful .
( Video ) E@@ r@@ nest Har@@ dy : M@@ ed@@ ra around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s eleg@@ ant , resi@@ sted , resi@@ sting the remote .
CA : Ch@@ im@@ it A@@ di@@ sh@@ ot@@ er - people is more than a simple identity .
Video : A very simple story of stere@@ otyp@@ es , and the problem with stere@@ otyp@@ es isn &apos;t that false , is that they are in@@ complete .
CA : You know , your mind re@@ hear@@ sal ideas , and there &apos;s no randomly .
Be careful connected .
There are really amazing structure that is the very complex structure that is your personal personal view .
It &apos;s the oper@@ ative system of your brain .
It &apos;s like navi@@ gating around the world .
And it takes millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a small component of your world is the idea that the Gree@@ ks sound like , then , in the green of the world , you &apos;ll hope it .
But if another component of your world is the idea that the lions are dangerous is dangerous , then the green is going to require a little bit different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your life look like .
You need it to be the most reliable that is possible , a gu@@ id@@ ance for the te@@ mple but wonderful world of the outside .
Now , the different vi@@ sions of the world can be very different .
For example , how does it responds to your world vision when you see this picture : ( Video ) D@@ alia Mo@@ o@@ he@@ l : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; One woman of faith , &quot; &quot; an experiment , &quot; &quot; an experiment , even a sister . &quot;
Or &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; a terrorist washed &quot; &quot; a terrorist .
CA : S@@ ure , there are millions of people out there who respond in the way that respond very different .
If they communicate in the right way , they are able to change , to change , to change the way , to the way that somebody sees the world and transforming their actions so far as the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that makes human culture .
So if you accept that the main task as a repor@@ ter is to build an idea in your audience , here &apos;s four papers to address that task : First , limited to your talk to a single idea .
Things are complex things ; you need to reduce the content so that you need to reduce the content so that you might be in love , and having the opportunity to explain it .
You have to take context , sharing examples , that real .
So it &apos;s got a sense , and it &apos;s a kind that percei@@ ves the whole of your entire talk , so what you &apos;re talking to you is that you &apos;re going to give you a lot .
And secon@@ dly , it gives you a reason to show you a reason that you see .
Before we start to build things in your audience in your audience , you have to have their permission to go into it .
What is the tool to do it ?
The curiosity .
You &apos;re curious about your audience .
It &apos;s really intrigu@@ ing questions , it &apos;s caused to identify why something has no meaning and accurate .
If you can reveal a dis@@ connect in the world of somebody from somebody else , you would feel the need to cover that egg .
And when you look at that desire , it &apos;s much easier to build the idea .
Third , you build your idea , a piece of piece that your audience will understand .
It used the power of language to wea@@ ker together concepts that exist in the mind of who you hear , but not in your language , in your language .
It starts where they are .
The rela@@ tional repor@@ ter will forget that many terms and concep@@ tu@@ aries that inv@@ ites them are completely warm for their audiences .
Well , the me@@ als play a crucial thing to show you how to fit the pedestri@@ an , because it &apos;s going to be the way out of the pattern , based on an idea that you hear it .
For example , when Jen@@ ni@@ fer King K@@ a@@ h@@ n did not explain the incredible new bi@@ ot@@ ech called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you had a text piece of text .
J@@ P@@ S allows you to cut and take genetic information very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic inci@@ sion is like this kind of grap@@ pling moment of pen@@ sion in our mind .
It &apos;s important , so much , let the talk with friends with friends , and to see that there are some more confused .
It &apos;s going to show you . This is going to show you the end : I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to deserve to be shared .
( Laughter ) So I mean , I mean , who do you make this question ?
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea will only take you to you and your organization , then I feel like it , it &apos;s probably not worthy .
The audience will see through you .
But it turns out that the idea has the potential to light the day somebody or to change somebody or change the perspective of somebody else or inspire somebody to do things like this , then you have the essential ingredi@@ ent for a good problem , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
We only re@@ ject a 25 percent of what we &apos;re listening .
I promise you would promise you to hear every day you would promise to hear every day every day I would promise you every day .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ) So this ca@@ da@@ fe@@ l , with this ca@@ cop@@ l@@ ley goes on , is still hard to listen to .
And the art of the conver@@ sion of the conversation is the conver@@ sion of the conver@@ sion of the conver@@ sion and the art of the conver@@ sion of the conversation .
One world where we don &apos;t listen to each other by the other other people we don &apos;t hear each other .
( Laughter ) And to re@@ stra@@ in the egg , to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in and re@@ stra@@ ining the egg in order to re@@ stra@@ in
It &apos;s about the co@@ ast@@ al sounds .
For example , this is my se@@ xi@@ er .
We see that hearts are very interesting to be very interesting if we get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
So imagine you &apos;re in a morning of any place of any place of America , and you think , &quot; &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s the name of the apple ? &quot;
And you &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Per@@ son@@ e ...
This is the streets of 26 , that 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; M@@ i . C@@ ain . C@@ ain is the name of that apple ? &quot;
The streets have names , the apple is only spac@@ ec@@ raft without name between the streets . &quot; &quot; The Japanese people , a little bit confused and decent .
Now , imagine you &apos;re in a streets of cal@@ m somewhere , who@@ a to the person who you have next and ask questions , like this street ?
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Dad , this is the 17@@ th of the 17 , and that &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they said ,
The apple is .
Look at Google M@@ ap@@ is here . There &apos;s the apple apple , 15 , 18@@ -@@ 17 .
All of these apples have names . The streets are only in the name of the apple .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know how to meet your direction of your house ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . That &apos;s the D@@ V@@ C .
Seven to 17 , home number one . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ i . But walking up to the v@@ end@@ ar , I watched as the numbers don &apos;t go . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , yeah . You see it . They look at the way that they have built .
The first house built in a apple is the number one .
The second house you built is the number two .
The third one is the number three three . It &apos;s easy . &quot; &quot; I love you sometimes , we sometimes have to go on the other side of the world to tell us things that we have to go to the other side of the world &apos;s things that we &apos;ve been unable to .
As , for example , there &apos;s doctors in China that believe their work is to stay .
So every month you &apos;re supposed to have to pay for them , and when it &apos;s sick , it doesn &apos;t pay for them because they think they think they &apos;re talking about their work .
( Applause ) We think we think &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of the music sentence . One , two , three , four .
But in the music of the West Africa , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot;
So you can see it just listening not only in the j@@ ack@@ et but in the way that you count : D@@ evil , three , four , a .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that it &apos;s going to say that for any real thing you say about the India , the reverse also will be true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so we don &apos;t forget , so at TED , that for any brilliant idea that we have or we have or listen , the other way can be true .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just a bizar@@ re ar@@ ni@@ sm .
