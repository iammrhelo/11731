It was a fall of a fall of 2005 .
It was working on the science of science in the A@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ U , the Union Re@@ ic@@ y .
I looked at my work , but precisely that day I felt like a little bit of a little ch@@ unk .
So I found myself to my company Chris Anderson .
Chris took over 30 years working in the A@@ C@@ L@@ L@@ U , so I knew it would know how the work of institutions .
I told Chris I would feel a pun@@ ch@@ line .
I was resear@@ ching a number of questions about the net@@ working of science and liber@@ alism : very interesting .
But I wanted to do that AL@@ C@@ L@@ U approaches these problems more expensive , a way that could be a difference .
Chris was a big , and I wonder , &quot; &quot; Where are we all the way you are , cal@@ m are the five ones you are still doing ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; is the genetic discrimination , the re@@ productive technologies , the biom@@ olec@@ ules and ... ... &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s the genetic discrimination , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@ olec@@ ules , the biom@@
There &apos;s also a cool thing , the I@@ M@@ R@@ R@@ R@@ Y , there &apos;s also a cool thing , the I@@ M@@ R@@ R@@ R@@ Y , and ... ...
&quot; &quot; Ab@@ solu@@ tely , the subject of genetic patent . &quot; &quot; P@@ esti@@ tic genetic traits ?
Yes , that &apos;s , of course , is a patent tro@@ ll .
&quot; No ! &quot;
Are they saying that the American government ex@@ er@@ red ex@@ ac@@ ro@@ lob@@ s of body parts ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; I went back to my dis@@ gust and sent him to Chris three papers .
And 20 minutes later , it came up with a hundred thousand samples .
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t ! T@@ guys ! T@@ ill right ! What do you have to go ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; R@@ ats ! T@@ all ! T@@ y ! ( B@@ all sque@@ aks ) ( Laughter ) So who &apos;s going to go ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s a big lawyer , but it didn &apos;t know anything about it about the patent , and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t a lot of sun@@ set on a patent , but it wasn &apos;t a lot of a patent set .
I was clear that there was a lot of learning that learning before we put anybody .
First , we had to know exactly what I looked at when somebody beha@@ ves a gene .
The genetic patent tro@@ ll includes the scen@@ es , but the most discus@@ sed of all are called the DNA DNA , or it &apos;s a piece of DNA that &apos;s extrac@@ ting of a cell .
The defen@@ ses of this say , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t patent the hidden genes , and we &apos;re actually pat@@ ching the il@@ side genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , the second problem , where it &apos;s accurate the genes for use .
And the patent doesn &apos;t just take a gene on a particular gene , but all the possibilities is that gene that gene drives .
What does it mean ?
Well , you can &apos;t pass your genes to a physician and ask him that ex@@ am@@ am@@ ine , to see if you &apos;re going to have mutations , without permission from the patent .
It also means that the tu@@ ti@@ d-@@ looking tu@@ ck of the patent has the outer path of avoi@@ ding that gene in a clinical trial or clinical trials .
I &apos;m so worried that these tu@@ tor@@ es , the private companies , a little bit of private , a human genetic company was predic@@ ting the patients .
We have the case of Ab@@ ig@@ er , a little 10 years of Q@@ T syndrome , a heart disease that &apos;s not about , can cause sudden death .
The company that patent two genes associate this dog@@ ma , has changed a test for diagnos@@ ing the syndrome .
But then they went to the ban@@ d@@ g@@ a and they never came back to the o@@ be .
But the company that I had the sur@@ ge of pat@@ ented or de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating to demand for the patent .
Two years without power to do it .
Over that time , Ab@@ ig@@ ese died from Q@@ T long without diagnos@@ ing .
The patent tro@@ lls were a problem that predic@@ ts the patients .
Did you find some way to do it ?
Well , it turns out that the Su@@ pre@@ me Su@@ pre@@ me stopped clear a long list of cases , that there are some number of things that are not patho@@ logical .
You can &apos;t patent products : the air , water , min@@ eral water , the se@@ me@@ stone elements .
In the un@@ un@@ d-@@ laws laws of nature : the law of gravity , and = m@@ 2 .
I &apos;m really crucial and it &apos;s going to be the reach of all of the whole , and it &apos;s going to be the reach of everyone , and it &apos;s kind of crucial .
In our opinion , the structure of the most fundamental lives , which enco@@ des the production of all our proteins , is so a product of nature , like a dinosaur law , no matter what it means and our bodies or at the bottom of an end .
To report the best , we travel across the country to talk about different experts : scientists , professional professional , lawyer , lawyer , pat@@ ents .
Most of the most told we had is why we had reason from a political point of political views , and when fewer than a legal point of view .
They all thought the chance to get out to our topic is so so much as the heart .
But why ?
It turns out that the patent card has yiel@@ ded these over 20 years .
There were thousands of patent tro@@ lls of human genes .
The patent court was very stun@@ ned in the status qu@@ o , the bi@@ ot@@ ech industry industry , the bi@@ ot@@ ech industry , the same practice , the ic@@ on@@ ograp@@ hy of the year 2000 year to Congress , without getting ta@@ m@@ wood on it .
It &apos;s called the cour@@ ts , the cour@@ ts weren &apos;t supposed to be e@@ mul@@ ular by these patent .
But it &apos;s not like Chris and I think it &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and we said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not ab@@ used , but we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s right , the worst one , the worst one , the top two lines to follow .
So we started to fix our cause .
The retirement retirement is going to be : Com@@ mission@@ er , the I@@ F@@ A , and the F@@ err@@ orism O@@ per@@ ations .
We didn &apos;t really care about that kind of causes , we think our causes full lot more .
It &apos;s based on the scientific freedom , the medical break@@ through@@ s and the patients of patients .
So we decided to open a cause that would not be like the shy there are either patent , but a cause causes of the subjects .
We &apos;ve done a nonprofit to take a genetic patent to defend the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of their patent to then organize a co@@ p of demo@@ s and experiment that they told them to the cour@@ ts like these patent tro@@ lls in patients and they were in@@ corporate .
We think the ideal candidate to demand was M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad Gen@@ e@@ a , a company with se@@ sters in Sal@@ t Law School , U@@ ta@@ h .
M@@ y@@ th@@ ad had the patent tro@@ lls from two genes , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ A@@ 1 and B@@ R@@ A@@ 2 .
Women with certain mutations in these genes are likely to have more likely to deal with cancer , and it &apos;s a little bit of the odds of heart and a mon@@ ster .
A total mon@@ ic@@ e-@@ on the top of the B@@ CR@@ A , a total mon@@ ic@@ oc@@ a on the United States .
He said that several reports from the B@@ CR@@ A &apos;s license test out of B@@ CR@@ A .
They were a lot of money for their ex@@ am : $ 3,000 .
They were going to share their clinical data with international scientific community .
And if you look at the worst of all , for a period of several years , M@@ y@@ ran@@ u den@@ i@@ led the exam@@ ination so that it includes extra mutations that were identified by a team of researchers in France .
It was so much that during this period , for several years , until a 12@@ 0-@@ percent of the females were made of wrong wrong : a negative outcome that should be positive .
This is K@@ at@@ h@@ le@@ an M@@ ax@@ i@@ an .
Ken@@ ey &apos;s sister , E@@ il@@ en , developed cancer with 40 years and made the exam@@ ine exam@@ ard exam@@ ined by 40 years and made their exam@@ ined exam@@ s .
It gave me negative negative .
The family had passed .
The most likely was that cancer wasn &apos;t present in the family , so the other family members didn &apos;t need to exam@@ ination .
Two years later , K@@ at@@ h@@ le@@ m diagnosed a cancer cell in advanced state .
It turned out that sister &apos;s sister &apos;s sister was found between that 12 percent of people who received a negative outcome .
If E@@ ile@@ en had a result of the right outcome , K@@ ath@@ h@@ in@@ ate would actually make me exam@@ ination , and would she ev@@ o@@ ked his heart cancer .
I could actually ac@@ commod@@ ate these problems .
They were genetic genetic genetic traits , and individual women who were created by the most 15@@ 0,000 scientists and professional women who were created by the most 15@@ 0,000 scientists and professional women who were not allowed to pay for M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad , or they &apos;d want to have a second opinion that they couldn &apos;t afford to give them , because of the patent .
One of the main challenges we face when we prepare this case was to think about the way that science .
To the arguments that I did was not a place I was going to be a inv@@ ant , and that the hidden , the Bil@@ CA CA : had to explain a couple of basic concept , like , what is a gene ? What is a DNA ?
As if the DNA , and why is it not a unusual way ?
We as@@ sign hours and hours of our demo@@ s and experiment , trying to give it the way to explain these concept of simple way of the most sk@@ ir@@ ts .
And at the end we end up with the me@@ mo@@ ir d@@ well@@ ers , like gold .
So home is a DNA extrac@@ e-@@ the-@@ old gold player from a single one , or the reading of a river .
You can patent the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold .
The way you get the work back to pull the gold down down ; you can &apos;t patent it , follow being gold .
And the gold , a time , can use it all sorts of things in the world that couldn &apos;t use when it was in the mountain ; with it , with it , you can &apos;t patent the gold , because it &apos;s still gold .
In 2009 , we were able to be li@@ sted to present the case .
We &apos;re doing it in the front of the Fe@@ deral F@@ ore@@ der@@ al district district , and the case of the fossi@@ lized case , the h@@ ills , the Jo@@ we@@ et Robert S@@ we@@ et .
In the mar@@ vel@@ ing of 2010 , the S@@ we@@ et S@@ we@@ et issu@@ ed his ver@@ b : 15@@ 2 pages .
When we read their opinion , we im@@ wonder how to describe the science of the case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not that good .
How could it develop a deep awareness of the subject in that little time ?
We can &apos;t imagine as possible as it possible .
So it worked hard to work with the S@@ we@@ et S@@ we@@ et of that , not just a lawyer — it was scientific .
And not only science was scientific — I had a PhD in biology .
( Laughter ) I was lucky enough .
So M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s called the F@@ inal F@@ it is called the Fe@@ deral Tra@@ de .
And here things get interesting .
First of all , in a life moment , the government of the United States changed the way .
In the district district , government issu@@ ed a report of M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
But in the direct place to his own patent card , the government presented a report that said that he was going to re@@ consider this topic of the decision of the court of district district , and I conclu@@ ded that the islands was not sus@@ cep@@ tible to being patent .
This was very important , and it was absolutely unexpected .
The FBI &apos;s license is going to take all cases of patent , and it &apos;s called his sudden , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
So even with this remarkable event , we told them to lose .
And so it was .
More or less .
The decision was to two against one .
More the two coun@@ ts that vote against us , they did it because it &apos;s totally different .
The first one , the entire American Re@@ ou@@ ri@@ ri@@ e has changed its own and new biological bio@@ chemistry , totally wrong .
( Laughter ) But this is a little bit wrong .
M@@ y@@ ad ta@@ m@@ med argu@@ es that , so I didn &apos;t have any sense .
The other hi@@ stories , the whole Mo@@ ore , said he agreed to us , how to be the del@@ il@@ il@@ side of the nature of nature .
But &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to leave you to the bi@@ ot@@ ech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , the British , the Br@@ yan , gave the reason .
You have to have a question that you have to respond to the law that &apos;s respon@@ ding to the Bible .
So the general , these questions take the way that way to a while par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h , a little girl with a bunch of high-@@ old cl@@ ay lot , where &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; so that &apos;s why we go .
We did that , and that &apos;s the most short-@@ dimensional question that &apos;s got rid of it .
Five of words : Are they patho@@ logy the human genes ?
When Chris told me , or what I thought about these words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think you would have to say , &apos; Is it the patent . &quot; &quot; No .
I want that the judgment has the same reaction I had to tell me about seven years ago . &quot; &quot; And of course , I was going to say that , I know , it &apos;s seven years .
The Su@@ pre@@ me Su@@ pre@@ me only one percent of the cases that had taken , and I accepted our own .
It &apos;s the day of or@@ gs and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people outside , people who were driving around the two : 30 of the morning , and then I would go into the jun@@ k of the morning of the morning to try to get into the jun@@ k .
They organized in the cancer of chest cancer , organized a mani@@ fe@@ station of the thro@@ at .
Chris and I took together in the hall@@ way , moments before he ri@@ ving the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he did .
But all of that , in that place , when I came up in the room and I saw my hi@@ stories around me , and I saw my hi@@ stories around , and I found myself a lot of the most common aspects of his own , the women who knew and had the personal storytelling of the way , the gene@@ tici@@ sts that were going to be seen by the court of court fees to the court of court fees to the court of court fees to the court of court fees to the court of
In the room , they were also three leaders from the Human Gen@@ ome Project , including the co-@@ vi@@ sc@@ of DNA , James Wat@@ son , who had to introduce a report to court , where he would have to patent the one to make reality this day would tell you how to make it a little bit of what we had to do is we had to play a lot of time .
The claim was engaging .
Chris claimed it &apos;s a brilliant way .
But to me , the most passionate about me was to see the coun@@ ts of the Su@@ pre@@ me T@@ gency trying to understand the actual DNA of the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t to understand the DNA , measured a series of synthe@@ sis and dialo@@ gu@@ es , in a very similar way to the last seven years .
The youth in K@@ ag@@ an was associated with the illusion of DNA with extrac@@ ting a medi@@ a-@@ half-@@ inch plant plant .
The French &apos;s license is called it to make a box of baseball b@@ uc@@ ket from a tree .
And what it &apos;s like to me was my favorite moment , the S@@ ot@@ ci@@ y@@ or S@@ ot@@ ci@@ or determin@@ es that the DNA was very important . ( Laughter ) When we had that day from the last two to we were really confident , but it &apos;s a special thing that &apos;s going to be a result : nine to the heart .
A natural se@@ at@@ ment is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not sus@@ cep@@ tible to being patho@@ logically alone because outside .
And what it is , M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad had had nothing . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; and four hours after the decision , five of the studies announced that they were starting to offer the ex@@ cess to the B@@ CA by the B@@ CA .
Some of them promised to offer the most cheap exam@@ s than M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
Some promised place to offer a much more ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite ex@@ am with the M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
But the decision of the court was still from M@@ y@@ ri@@ ad .
Re@@ de@@ mption with a cancer gap that would allow you to emplo@@ ying genes in the United States .
They were born at@@ ch@@ ers that were suffering and the bi@@ ome@@ d-@@ growing research .
And he helped to make that patients like Ab@@ ig@@ er , K@@ at@@ le@@ le@@ m and E@@ ile@@ en had access to exam@@ s that needed .
Little weeks after court comes in his decision , he had to have a little sn@@ ap@@ shot in the box of his email .
It was from Bob Co@@ ch@@ -@@ D@@ e@@ e@@ e@@ an , a teacher from Du@@ ke University and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit , and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit , and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit , and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit , and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit , and one of the first people that I and Chris
( Laughter ) We did do it much with this case .
Some of what he gave us to the brave risks was to know that we were setting up the right thing .
The process la@@ sted almost eight years from the beginning to finally , with many of these voices and mi@@ sc@@ raped by the way .
Of course , lucky enough , but it &apos;s been the communities that we un@@ lined up , and the al@@ an@@ makers that we create , the ones we have to have , the ones we have to have , the ones we have to have , the ones we have to have , the ones we have to do , and the al@@ an@@ as we create , the ones we have , the ones we have , the ones we have , the ones we have , the ones we have , the ones we have
Thank you .
( Applause )
O@@ la . Today , I &apos;m going to show you a few che@@ eks from eight of my projects , made in collabor@@ ation with the perfor@@ ms with the P@@ enn@@ syl@@ v@@ ans .
We &apos;re calling you to call P@@ P@@ R@@ s &amp; R@@ o and we live in the India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , which I call &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; — I call me the &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — I call me in the peculiar habits of my uncle saying to me constantly saying things like a whole body , a whole thing , a whole thing about it , and it &apos;s going to make a glass of water or a piece of to@@ bac@@ co .
When I grew up , the thing was worse and I ate it as a way of control .
Of course , I couldn &apos;t say anything to say anything , because the guy is a very suppor@@ tive figure in the family .
What else was it , and he dis@@ changed his phone use .
He would take the au@@ du@@ ular and I would wait for the number of him .
As a response , and as I was ag@@ as@@ tic for my uncle , I would say , &quot; &quot; The phone , &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s so long that they make a lot of people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone phone .
The problem is , when I went home and I went to university , I started to get a little less to her or@@ des .
So I did I &apos;ve done a little bit of writing a little bit of the way I could give your ears to the ears and suddenly the world the electronic world .
What I had to do was take a piece of paper , put the paper in the car , writing the electronic email , writing the electronic motor or the paper and pull the paper .
This device would send investors to the person in the matter of the letter in the right way .
So here you see that we have a lot of electronic approaches that understand all the mechanical acts that understand all the mechanical properties and they &apos;re constantly saying that they are actually digital .
So my uncle is only an mechanical interface .
And then , from the right , the object has to be great@@ ly engaged and having a touch of kidney , like I like my uncle .
The next job is an anti@@ therap@@ tional device to the sound we call the &quot; &quot; The P@@ ig@@ n@@ o &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the mood of being surrounded by a tribal , sensitive tribal creatures .
This works like this . We have these p@@ ins here on the wall , and then we have these little creatures that the Ap@@ ol@@ lo us .
As we were in the silent way we get in the silent way , inti@@ mi@@ an .
And if there &apos;s more sil@@ k@@ ul@@ es , there are the fish .
And at the least they &apos;re going to get there again .
So we have these p@@ ins in three walls in the room .
And we had some of these little p@@ ounding pig@@ ments behind .
And so it &apos;s how it works .
This is a video game proto@@ col@@ s .
When there &apos;s silent , it &apos;s standing behind the last of the last summer , and when there &apos;s silent , it &apos;s standing behind the last of the last summer , and when there &apos;s silent , it &apos;s standing behind the last of the last summer , and when there &apos;s silent , it &apos;s standing behind the last of the last summer , and when there &apos;s silent , it &apos;s standing behind the last of the last summer , and when there &apos;s silent , it &apos;s standing behind the last of the last
We create the real creatures or the real creatures , and they feel like humans or the real creatures or the real creatures .
And they eat the sounds of the sounds that they &apos;re going to do in there .
They don &apos;t respond to the sound of the bottom .
O@@ il a gift in a moment that didn &apos;t respond .
( ru@@ g ) But it &apos;s reaction to the sounds in the first plan .
( Applause ) We work hard to do it , and we work hard to do it as well .
Every p@@ its has its own behavior , the psych@@ ic , the sense of humor , personalized , etc .
This is a very pre@@ mature proto@@ .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We did that re@@ understood people , but we saw that people were pretty beautiful and infant with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; the person &apos;s lost . &quot; &quot; We were really intrigu@@ ed with the idea of the very interesting idea of in@@ visibility .
How would it be possible to experiment in@@ visibility ?
We worked with a specialized software company in the surveillance campaign and we asked them to create software with us using a camera that could look at people in the room , and then we can follow the people with the bottom , and then get the invisible to a person with the bottom , going back to the person with the bottom , going to be invisible .
I &apos;ll show you a very pre@@ mature prototype .
So the challenge , you can see my colleague S@@ ears , who actually , is in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the processing video where the camera makes invisible .
S@@ ound en@@ ters . See ! Be invisible .
You can see how the camera goes and the bra@@ ke .
It &apos;s a pre@@ mature video , so we still don &apos;t make the sol@@ o , and all that , but it &apos;s perfect , it was a little bit closer , more like it .
This is a place where there was a camera to look at space and we had a monitor on each wall .
And second people would be able to see themselves in the monitor , but by a distinction : a person was constantly invisible to where they want to move in the room .
This work is called the sun &apos;s shadows . It was almost like a piece of paper , like a record of a child , a sp@@ or@@ d-@@ child he@@ h .
So in front of this object seems to be very strong and rob@@ ust and a side of it , almost it seems very weak .
People would walk through the room and almost the ignor@@ er thinking that was some trac@@ ked .
But instead , it would start to take a little bit out of the wall in the way .
It &apos;s going to be a long time .
( Laughter ) This work is a car@@ pet from a ball of re@@ hear@@ sal .
Their head is so heavy , full of memories , that it seems to fall in their own str@@ ings and its body grows almost like a plant .
What do it &apos;s moving from your head to your head as if you were a b@@ un@@ ge in a very un@@ predictable movement .
It &apos;s like thank you for that circle .
Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the soil outside the way , it would start to de@@ am@@ am@@ pling out space .
And there &apos;s no flu@@ x .
So I &apos;ll show you an example . When people go into housing , it &apos;s going to be this object .
And so slowly , in a few minutes , you think it &apos;s terrible , it &apos;s fast , it &apos;s fast , it seems to be a part of the hun@@ ter .
This is a important moment because we wanted to un@@ pack the vie@@ wers of a gut , and to help it or save it .
But it doesn &apos;t need the needs because it &apos;s even a thing to be able to get it again .
This work was an authentic , techn@@ ician , and we worked hard , like in most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanical mechan@@ ic and a for@@ um dynamic .
It was very important to us to make the exact moment that it &apos;s going to be , because if we make it so that the balance that balance the balance , then you &apos;ll help it , and if you don &apos;t just fall out there , I wouldn &apos;t have to help you , but it wouldn &apos;t cost that fat@@ al , or that effect of wanting to make it .
I &apos;ll show you a very fast video clip where we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my company . We &apos;re going to go .
Now , there &apos;s going to be data to get nervous , so it &apos;s going to take it .
But it doesn &apos;t need to do it because it &apos;s going to be the same .
This is a work that we &apos;ve been really intrigu@@ ed by , working with the presence of the cha@@ otic skin with thousands of tons of op@@ tics , that shine as the no@@ vi@@ mo@@ tur@@ um of the no@@ tion-@@ str@@ apped .
And it &apos;s the scale of the no@@ tion-@@ ce@@ me@@ tery .
We &apos;ll come back to this one drop of g@@ lit@@ tering way , which was pasted from the face .
The idea was to hire something that raw and useful , distant and abstract as the universe in familiar with a very familiar way , which is very comfor@@ ting and intimate .
So the idea was that at any point we would probably probably let the shape of a mu@@ st@@ le and almost the lost way as a hole in space , like if you were looking at a h@@ ob@@ bling of the bright no@@ de .
This is the last job , even process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the apple space . &quot; &quot; Imagine a cu@@ sto@@ b@@ y that &apos;s like this big path of housing , and that , you know , you &apos;ll try to make a sense of a kind of a four-@@ by-@@ tail cu@@ be than a high and four times the volume of size and four times its volume .
This object is in constant expan@@ sion and counter@@ intuitive to create a lot of people moving around , like if you try to hiding a secret in your pocket or something like this .
We work with a lot of technology , but it &apos;s true not like not just like the not like , because it &apos;s really not like the work for years and years .
But we use it because we are interested in the way that helps us express emotions and patterns of behaviors in these creatures that we create .
When a creature tells us the mind , and almost as if the process was discovered , the way we have this creature wants to exist , that way , how do we want to move and how to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start to give you a useful tru@@ ce to the very technological , and the way requires you , and the way requires it for two minutes .
But before I was going to re@@ stra@@ in , I want to ask you now , you think you look at your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
A lot of you are suddenly in a way you &apos;re in a couple of weeks , you &apos;re suddenly in a way , you &apos;re just getting angry ?
I &apos;d priori@@ sed , with the cru@@ x , the sk@@ illed sk@@ ir@@ ts , and the sk@@ illed ro@@ lls .
Sometimes we put the arm so that .
Sometimes I was in . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter ) I know I can &apos;t . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter ) I know I can &apos;t . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter ) I know I can &apos;t . ( Laughter ) I know I can &apos;t . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter
It &apos;s about attention to the fa@@ ti@@ fying you do right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this one in a few minutes , and I hope that if you learn that to modi@@ fy a little bit can change the development of your life .
Well , we are fascinated with body language and a long 2@@ 6@@ -year-old language , and especially the language of other people .
You know , a couple of years — this , I &apos;m going to — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — a to@@ dd@@ led , a little bit of a mo@@ i@@ ster , a little bit of a little bit , or a little bit like a stick of hands .
N@@ arr@@ ator : So here they are coming to the number 10 .
This poli@@ ce@@ men are lucky , and it gives him the president to the United States .
There &apos;s the first minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy C@@ r@@ dy : Put a squee@@ zing , or his abs@@ ence , you may have to talk for weeks and weeks ; it might be you who speak for weeks and weeks ; it might be the first minister for weeks and weeks ; it might be the first minister for weeks and weeks ; it might be the first minister for weeks and weeks ; it might be the first minister for weeks and weeks ; it might be the first
B@@ BC and the Times Times .
So when we think about it in non-@@ verbal language or language language , we have soci@@ ologists , we have we have social language — we talk about language , so we &apos;re both very verbal language .
When we talk about communication we think about how we think about communication .
What about your body language language ?
What do you communicate me ?
There are reasons to believe that it &apos;s true that we &apos;re going to be seen this en@@ du@@ ous en@@ ph@@ it .
Soci@@ ologists are very long or from other people or other people , about the retirement .
We make it all the way that body language comes from .
They can predict important proj@@ ections in life as if we hire or promote or promote or who we ask for a quote .
For example , I &apos;m going to N@@ al@@ in@@ y An@@ ci@@ ary , a researcher at the University of T@@ u@@ ph@@ ts , demonstr@@ ating that when somebody comes in a 3@@ D@@ -@@ second drug online are actually the symp@@ athy of the doctor &apos;s mind if that doctor &apos;s mind will be demo@@ ed or not .
So it doesn &apos;t have to see so much with the doctor &apos;s doctor or not in@@ adequate but with you to like that person and how much internal it or .
Even more of the d@@ rought , Ale@@ x To@@ k@@ o@@ v , a field at Prin@@ ce@@ ton , demonstr@@ ates the that the Jewish of the political candidates gave a second 70 percent of the outcome of career to the police and the Sen@@ ate of the U.S. and even the U.S.
If you make a bad use of them is bad idea , no ?
Talk about verbal language is not verbal language is to talk about how we shine to other , how to do it , how do we do it and are the consequences .
But let &apos;s let the forget forget the other audience that will make our language not verbal language , that we are ourselves .
It includes our non-@@ verbal language , not verbal language , our thoughts and senti@@ ology .
What language is not verbal language am talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psycho@@ tic psycho@@ tic , and I &apos;ve realized that it &apos;s inevitable and it hur@@ ts a competition for business school so that it was inevitable that it was inevitable that I could .
It &apos;s based on all of the non-@@ verbal engagement , not verbal , but it &apos;s kind of a .
What are the facts not verbal or not , but it &apos;s kind of domin@@ ation ?
Well , yeah , it &apos;s this .
In the animal kingdom , you have to see the expan@@ sion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expan@@ sion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expan@@ sion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expan@@ sion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expan@@ sion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expan@@ sion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with
So if you go big , you &apos;re going to get a lot of , you &apos;re going to be able to get big , you &apos;re going to open space , you &apos;ll basically turn space , basically April .
It &apos;s open to April .
And it works like this whole planet , and it &apos;s the whole animal , and it works like this in the animal kingdom , and it works like this in the entire animal kingdom , and it works like this in the entire animal kingdom , and it works like this in the entire animal kingdom , and it works like this in the entire animal kingdom , and it works like this in the entire animal kingdom , and it works like this in the entire animal kingdom , and it works like this in the entire
It &apos;s not only clean@@ er to pri@@ se .
Hum@@ ans do the same . ( Laughter ) F@@ an so humans do that when they have power in permanent ways and also when they feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because we &apos;ve always shown us the ancient and universal that are these ex@@ cess ex@@ ec@@ ute .
This ex@@ pression , known as or@@ gu@@ ard , was studied by J@@ ess@@ ica T@@ y , and he said , &quot; &quot; This ex@@ pression , &quot; &quot; was studied by J@@ ess@@ ica , and this ex@@ pression , known as or@@ pha@@ s@@ si@@ cal , was studied by J@@ ess@@ ica , who was studying as or@@ pha@@ s@@ si@@ cal , and that was been studied by J@@ ess@@ ica , who was studying as or@@ pha@@ s@@ si@@ cal , and that was been studied by J@@ ess@@ ica , who
I told you that I told you that the people who are so much con@@ active , who tells us that the people who are so much con@@ active , they are actually doing the same thing when they &apos;re going to have a physical competition .
So when you walk up the end and you win it doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;ve never seen anything to do it .
They do so .
The arm goes up , the top of the top , the very high one .
What do we do when we feel helpl@@ ess ?
We make the exact opposite .
We were we . We &apos;ll come .
We are small .
We don &apos;t want to make it out of who &apos;s our own .
And so much of the animals we do the same .
And this is what happens when you &apos;re going to be able to im@@ power .
What we tend to do when it &apos;s a power to comple@@ tion the non-@@ verbal language of the other .
So somebody &apos;s showing it , so if somebody shows it up , we &apos;re going to get the little smaller . We don &apos;t .
We make the opposite .
If I see this behavior in class , you notice it ?
I &apos;m not in the world &apos;s rent , and I &apos;m not very verbal language .
There are people who are car@@ d@@ ling from the al@@ ph@@ a , they go into the class , they ate the middle of the class before they start to occu@@ py space .
When they sit there , they seem to explo@@ de .
E@@ r@@ en on the hand so .
There are other people who go smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly h@@ ack@@ ard .
See it in your face and your body , you feel in the chair , and you &apos;ll sit down in the chair , and you do it as you go to the hand .
So I look at two things .
A man doesn &apos;t surprise you .
It &apos;s going to have to see with sex .
Women are more likely to do it that men .
The first women always used to the men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that it &apos;s been se@@ ding to the record of the school of the r@@ um@@ ination and with its level of participating .
And this is very important in the class of M@@ B@@ A because the rating comes to the media media .
The schools of business are they emplo@@ ying with the distinction of treas@@ ure .
They are women and men as they , and then we see these differences in the grades , that they seem to be attribu@@ ted to the school .
I started asking me , if there are people who go to that attitude and participating in the air , and then I started to ask myself , if there are people who go to that attitude and then I would ask myself , if there are people who go to that attitude and then I would ask , if there are people who go to that attitude and then I would ask , if there are people who go to that attitude and then I would ask , if there are people who go to that attitude and
So it &apos;s going to be possible to make another fine thing that &apos;s going to be possible to do that , and that &apos;s going to be possible to do that , and that &apos;s going to be able to do that ?
My collabor@@ ator D@@ an Car@@ ney , who &apos;s in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , and I want to know if you can pretend to do it .
I mean , you can do it just by an int@@ on@@ ture and experiment to experience a outcome in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language not ver@@ di@@ al language , what other people feel , and think of us , there &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question is : we are par@@ o@@ os@@ cop@@ s language , we feel that we feel and we think of ourselves ?
There &apos;s a test that &apos;s so .
For example , we s@@ wa@@ p when we are happy , but also when we &apos;re going to be laughing ating up to a cake , so it &apos;s going to feel happy .
It works in the two directions .
When it comes to power , it &apos;s also working on the two directions .
When we feel powerful , it &apos;s more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we pretend it , it &apos;s also possible that when we pretend to be powerful is more likely to feel that we really feel powerful .
Well , the second question was actually , well , well , we know that the mind is our body , but it &apos;s not just right , the body is not just the body , but it &apos;s not just the body that &apos;s body to our mind ?
And when I say , in case the powerful case , I &apos;m talking about ?
Because I talk about thoughts and feelings and senti@@ ent compos@@ ition that I have both thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about hormones .
So how is the mind of the powerful way compared to the ones that are not ?
The powerful people tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , more and insurance , more likely to .
They have the feeling of what they &apos;re going to win in the bal@@ let games .
They also tend to think about a more abstract way .
There &apos;s a lot of difference . It suff@@ ers more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of difference between the powerful ones and the ones that are not .
It &apos;s also also the difference , so it &apos;s also the key oy@@ st@@ os@@ ter , the one that is the hormone of the domin@@ ation , the domin@@ ance , and the p@@ is@@ on@@ ol , which is the hormone hormone .
The males are very much able to the only power in the pre-@@ body &apos;s largest levels of pri@@ orities , and that &apos;s powerful and effective and efficient leaders of the very powerful and effective leaders of the world and effective and efficient leaders and effective and efficient leaders .
What does it mean ? ( Applause ) ( Applause ) I have to talk about power , right now from the label , because I had to see with the master oy@@ ster .
But the power has also to see our reactions in the stress of stress .
We want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with a high level of t@@ os@@ ter@@ um , but sensitive to stress ?
Pro@@ b@@ ably not really , true ?
We want a person who &apos;s powerful , it &apos;s obvious and dominant but not very sensitive , but not as much sensitive to stress , a person who &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing .
We know that in the US , we know that the pri@@ mate had to take control , if somebody has to take control , if somebody has to take a little bit of a little bit of paper , in the dead@@ -@@ run days , their role is a lot of and the cal@@ ori@@ um of it as well .
We have that evidence , that the body can shape the mind , at least the level of the ac@@ cess@@ ment , and also the paper of the ra@@ il can shape the mind .
So what happens when you get a piece of paper ? What do you do to a minim@@ um level , like this little manipul@@ ation or an action ?
We said , &quot; &quot; I want you to do it for two minutes you &apos;ll be , that makes you feel the most powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to apply people to the lab and make a little experiment , those people would have been able to take a little experiment , and then we are going to let us just go to the lab five minutes , and then they had just to take a little experiment right now .
This is one .
A couple of more , one billion more , one billion more and more lives , a couple more more and more lives more than a couple more more than a couple more billion more .
The media is called &quot; &quot; M@@ ul@@ ler &quot; &quot; .
So here we have a couple more .
You can stand up or sitting there .
So here are the possibility of de@@ fic@@ it .
Now , you &apos;re going to go small .
This is very low power .
When I have touched the neck stations , it really .
This is what happens .
They come , they go to a j@@ ar , and we talked to two minutes , and we talked to two minutes , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t have to do it or . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the possibilities .
We don &apos;t want to take a concept of power .
We want you to feel power .
So this two minutes .
We asked them , &quot; &quot; How powerful do you do ? &quot; &quot; then we asked the chance to put it in the way , to the end we take another sample of it .
That &apos;s all . This is all experiment .
This is what we found .
It will be risky , the bottom line ; we found that when it &apos;s a high power position to po@@ x the 8@@ 6 percent .
When they are in the posi@@ tivity of the power , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
We saw what we found with the e@@ ter@@ a .
It &apos;s normal to the normal part of its normal age , the powerful people experiments in a 20 percent , and the goals are given a two-@@ gram drop of 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and it &apos;s obsolete that changes .
Now the results with the sli@@ p@@ on@@ -@@ ly@@ on@@ ol results .
The most powerful experience is a 25 percent of the dec@@ or@@ ation , the most de@@ bil@@ itation experience of the 15@@ -@@ percent .
Just two minutes , we &apos;ll make these hormone vol@@ ries that will actually con@@ set your brain to make it easy , secure or comfor@@ t@@ ably , or well , and feel like the ap@@ parent .
We all know that feeling , right ?
It &apos;s that our language not ver@@ i@@ ver@@ ge , but not just to the way that we are not just too much , but we are ourselves .
The body can change the mind .
The next question , of course , is — can a world that could be able to have a na@@ tion-@@ on@@ al@@ ar@@ al framework to make life significant ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , this experiment , it &apos;s just two minutes .
Where can you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what you care .
We think where you need it to be in the situation in the way you were used to the people who were used , like in the very short social media in the world , we think that it &apos;s where you are in the very time-@@ frau@@ ght social media regions , and we think that where you need it , in the very short social media , we think that way of the things that are necessary in the world are often in the way that we are in the very contex@@ tual situations , we think
I would think you &apos;re going to have your friends .
For adolesc@@ ents are at the table of the come@@ pain table .
For some people is talking about the school &apos;s retirement .
It could be the gift of the business or giving a talk like this or going to a job interview .
We can take a chicken with that most people who identify because many of them had been through it , the interview interview .
So we then put the results , the first one &apos;s first interested in the first course of this , and he said — well , this is what we do when we go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) We were told , and we said , &quot; &quot; No , God , no , no , no , we want to say .
For many reasons , not , don &apos;t do it .
Again , it &apos;s not about the other people .
It &apos;s about you to talk you .
What you do before go to a job interview ?
You &apos;re sitting there . Mi@@ tting your iPhone — or your Android , we don &apos;t let anybody outside .
Re@@ pa@@ ir@@ a text messages , you &apos;re going to run , to make a little , add , when really you should be doing this , maybe you should be doing this , maybe in the middle , right ?
That &apos;s what we want to do , okay ?
We invited people to the lab , and they adopted them down the top and down the road , and then they went to an interview , they ran a job interview , and they went on a very long time , they ran an interview interview , and they went on a very long time , they ran an interview interview , and they went on a very long time , they ran an interview interview , and they went on a very long time , they ran an interview interview , and they went on a very
Seven minutes of a time , I have to record a five-@@ minute study of five minutes of time .
Also the ones are going to run , and the retirement is ad@@ mitted to not make it verbal food , but the retirement is being e@@ licit by not ver@@ i@@ fying .
So imagine this person interview with you .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you can inter@@ mit .
People are all the lives of this .
It &apos;s what M@@ ari@@ ann@@ e Law calls &quot; &quot; be in the social sector . &quot; &quot; This dis@@ charge that &apos;s un@@ folding .
This is the interview that we add , because we wanted to see what happens .
We have analy@@ sts by looking at the body , four in total .
They don &apos;t know the chance . They don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have a sense of what we take from each person and the end of the eye of the eye , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all the possibility of power . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all the possibility of power . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all the possibility of power . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all
We don &apos;t want to hire any good .
We gave them a much more positive action to make it . &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It &apos;s not about the speech content .
It &apos;s about the presence of the presence they had to have .
Because we are evalu@@ ating all of these various focus on the skill : Are we going to have the speech ?
Ex@@ ter@@ nal ? What rating aliz@@ ations do ?
These things don &apos;t affect . That &apos;s what it affects .
This kind of stuff .
Every person &apos;s oper@@ ative , basically .
You do what they are .
They take their ideas , themselves , without any extra .
So this is what causes or reverse the effect .
When I talk to people about this , that our body changes our bodies and the behavior can change our way of being , saying , &quot; &quot; It seems fin@@ dly . &quot; &quot; A@@ i yeah ?
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s going to be the kni@@ fe .
I &apos;m not so .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like a impos@@ tor .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel there to feel there .
This is very important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an impos@@ tor and feeling of feeling like I didn &apos;t have to be there .
When I was 19 , I was 19 , I had a car accident .
I told me I was going to go back and I gave a ca@@ p@@ p@@ it .
I told you the car &apos;s dis@@ requ@@ ited .
I waited for the U@@ C@@ I with a wound in my head . B@@ ot@@ ed me from college and told me my C@@ I had had two du@@ res of stat@@ ue . It was very traumatic .
I knew my C@@ I because I had learned as a super-@@ pla@@ ot@@ ous , and I think it was a gift .
So me went from university and tried to go back .
D@@ ic@@ or@@ a@@ .@@ Me : &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know how to end the career .
You must accept that there are other things you can do , but in your case , it &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; I had to deal with that , and I have to say that you &apos;re going to take your identity , what really you really are , who you really , who you really , who you are , who you really , who are the most helpl@@ ess of you can do to feel .
I felt totally helpl@@ ess .
So I worked and worked and worked , and I &apos;ve been struck by and I &apos;ve been lucky , and I was lucky , and I was working on , and I was working on , and I was working on this .
And finally I went to college .
I took four years to my fellow fellow , and I &apos;m going to convince somebody , my an@@ king of the garage , S@@ us@@ ke@@ z , so I was an ap@@ ten@@ ty-@@ ce@@ ton , and I was feeling like I didn &apos;t have to be there yet .
The night before the middle of a year , the middle night is a second one .
That &apos;s like .
I had so much fear of the worm &apos;s ex@@ clu@@ ded worm day that I called and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to let it , because I put it out . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t let it , because I put you and go .
V@@ em@@ iting , and this is what &apos;s going to do .
You see all the ex@@ qu@@ ices that you can do .
It just val@@ ves to do it , and do it , and then it &apos;s even a little bit out or even a experience experience , until you get the moment that the moment you &apos;re told , &quot; &quot; We need the &quot; &quot; quote .
I &apos;ve come to here . I &apos;m going to do it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years of record record , a few years ago , you know , in Nor@@ we@@ ster@@ o@@ ster@@ n , I &apos;m not thinking about it , but for a long time I had the feeling of that I couldn &apos;t have been there .
The end of my first year in Harvard , a student who hadn &apos;t talked about the class in the middle of the se@@ a@@ ster , the one that they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to be working or dra@@ gging it , and I don &apos;t know before .
T@@ ot@@ ally defe@@ ated , said , &quot; &quot; I should not be here . &quot;
That &apos;s my moment .
Because it &apos;s going to happen two things .
The first one I realized I was : V@@ ar@@ ites me . I don &apos;t feel like this .
She didn &apos;t sit so much like this , but she stays there in his place .
The second was , of course , should be there !
We &apos;re going to make it fin@@ ancing and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , yeah . Yes . Yes . Yes . &quot;
Ma@@ king will make it powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) V@@ ans go to the class and you know what — ( Applause ) V@@ ans go to class and heads the best speech . &quot; &quot; And you know ? I took the best speech of all , the people &apos;s man@@ tr@@ a and saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to , I don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s going to sit there . ( Laughter ) I saw me a few months later and I ate that no doubt that I
So it changed .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no fin@@ es to do it .
There &apos;s a fin@@ ite until it turned out .
There are just going to transform it , and we can inter@@ na@@ tion@@ ate it .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
Little Earth can take the big transforma@@ tions .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
Before I would end up to the next situation where I was first of war@@ r@@ en , for two minutes , try this , I had to go back to the bottom of the hair .
This is what you have to do .
To make the brain to make the better un@@ fortunate way to make it happen .
Su@@ bi@@ oy@@ tic te@@ mple . They were like the s@@ ap@@ on@@ ol .
You don &apos;t get away in the way to sit there , sit there who I &apos;m not talking about .
It &apos;s been de@@ vo@@ id with feeling that feeling of feeling that I &apos;m going to say who are and I &apos;m going to show you that .
I want to ask you before anything you take away from a power position , and I also want to invite you to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego is not on this . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll give you the people , because the best ones can use it , because the best ones can use it are those without resources , without the position or not power .
I &apos;ll walk out of it , because they can do it in private .
They just need their body , privacy and two minutes to change significantly significantly significantly significantly make the proj@@ ections of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; the bl@@ os@@ sion , &quot; &quot; which is probably a good option .
( Laughter ) But what will I talk about what &apos;s the great problems in the world ?
And I &apos;m going to say , before I go to the next , I would ask every single one to you to take off the paper and because I &apos;m going to ask you to help me to help you see how we do it .
So it &apos;s hard to paste and paper .
And finally , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world of the outside world .
I &apos;m going to read just a few .
800 million people are hungry .
One million people don &apos;t have access to the potential water .
We &apos;re just one billion without sanitation .
It &apos;s millions of millions of people dying of AIDS and AIDS .
The li@@ sts are still .
It &apos;s morning of a billion people who are actually going to affect the climate change , and then it &apos;s si@@ ghted .
We have many , many problems there .
It &apos;s a ideal world , we would solve all of it , but we don &apos;t .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all problems .
And if we don &apos;t , the question I think we should do — and that &apos;s why we are the reason for the economy of economy — that &apos;s why we are not really doing all , we have to ask ourselves , who are we all right , we should solve first ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had to say , 50 billion dollars of students to spend in the next four years to make this world , what should we spend ?
We are going to be 10 of the most large re@@ stra@@ ints of the m@@ ill , and just the lens of the lens , and just the lens of climate , the social and the way , the very same , the very good thing , the very same , the very good thing , and the pollution , the mal@@ matic movements , and the poor and sub@@ muni@@ tions and walls and sub@@ muni@@ tions and walls and subsi@@ dies and walls and subsi@@ dies and walls and underground walls .
We think these , in many ways , are vul@@ g@@ le@@ ar@@ ar@@ y-@@ play problems .
The question is , the thing about this next next , you would ask , well , what are the greatest ?
Why should we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s been asking us about a problem , but it &apos;s asking us to ask ourselves about a problem , but it &apos;s asking us to ask ourselves about a problem , whether we are asking ourselves , the fo@@ ob@@ ots of a general problem , but that &apos;s been asking us to ask ourselves about a problem , but it &apos;s asking us to ask ourselves about a problem , whether we are asking ourselves , the good thing that &apos;s asking about a little bit of the fo@@ ob@@ as the hell about it
Actually , that was the por@@ tion of what you talked about in D@@ avo@@ s in Japan .
But I &apos;m really excited , there &apos;s a problem if you ask people to care about the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
It certainly is the greatest problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the thing is not to priori@@ tize the problems , but it &apos;s remarkable to priori@@ tize the solutions .
And then it would be — naturally , naturally , it makes a little bit more complicated .
To change climate change , would be something like K@@ ey@@ a .
For the contex@@ ts , they could be clin@@ ics or networks for mosquitos .
For the hur@@ d@@ les , they would be the same war &apos;s peace , and so we could still go .
What would I like to ask you to do is try to do it , and in 30 seconds — and I know that some way it &apos;s possible — you have to tell what it &apos;s possible — you have to tell what are the pri@@ orities of pri@@ orities .
And also — it &apos;s also , of course , where the economy has become a threat — a kind of a that we shouldn &apos;t do in first place .
What should I be at the end of the list ?
Please , just 30 seconds , perhaps just about the ar@@ row , and just imagine it should be the main pri@@ orities and the least features we have to be the main prime of the world &apos;s greatest problems .
The surprising thing about this process — of course , I mean , I &apos;m going to I have a little - I &apos;m going to I , I &apos;m going to I have a little - I &apos;m told — I &apos;m going to I have a little - I &apos;m told , I &apos;m going to I know — I &apos;m going to I have a little more about my time , right ?
I &apos;d like to deep back , and I &apos;d like to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we did .
And also the enor@@ mously enor@@ mously , and I &apos;m sure you &apos;re also going to have these subjects , then to think , how do we priori@@ tize ?
So then , there &apos;s a question that if you ask the one , why would you have made a list of these earlier ?
And a reason is that the priori@@ tiz@@ ation is perfectly c@@ es@@ c@@ eless .
Nobody wants to do it .
Of course , the organiz@@ ers would want to be the most high-@@ off of a list like that .
But also all the organiz@@ ers stopped to not be at the top .
And there are many more often not numbers , but there &apos;s a lot more numbers in a single way .
60 years ago there &apos;s the U.N. , and it was a little bit of the big things we can do in the world , and we would say , well , well , if you have made a basic list of the great things we can do in the world , and say , well , well , what should we do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t be pri@@ cing — every decision is a priori@@ tized , so that we are all the most remarkable , so we &apos;re all the very focusing still , and we &apos;re not likely to forget that it &apos;s really good about how we really did the priori@@ tiz@@ ation , and we embrace and fail .
So what I &apos;m propos@@ ing is really saying we had , for a long time , a very small event of time , a situation that would exist in many other things .
There &apos;s a lot of things we can do out there , so we didn &apos;t have the black , and we didn &apos;t have the black ones , and not the ones .
We had no idea .
Imagine you walk in a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the black is .
You know , you have p@@ iz@@ za , but you don &apos;t know how it costs it costs .
It could be a bar@@ k , they could be 1,000 dollars .
Could it be a familiar p@@ iz@@ za , it could be a individual p@@ iz@@ za , no ?
We wanted to know these things .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s trying to do the Con@@ m@@ ac@@ tic Con@@ m@@ are — it &apos;s about putting the pre@@ ju@@ sted of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of Tr@@ ust Co@@ en@@ -@@ style process .
We &apos;re going to be 30 of the greatest economists from the world , three of each field .
We had three of the greatest economists from the planet writing about climate change .
How can we do ? What is their cost ? What do the benefit of doing it ?
The same with chronic diseases .
Do the best experts say , we can do it ?
What is the point ?
What should we do about it , and what would be the outcome ?
And so on .
So we took some of the greatest economists , eight of the greatest economists , including the three most economists , including the three main winners in the world , who are given to the Ma@@ pp@@ om@@ en of 2004 .
We call it &quot; &quot; d@@ am . &quot; &quot; The pre@@ f@@ ers of the European Union , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; you know . &quot; &quot; The pre@@ f@@ ers of the European Union report to the economy of the economy .
It works very well in Europe , but there &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did was we get a priori@@ tized list .
And then you ask you , why economists ?
And so I &apos;m very happy that I &apos;m going to make that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The theme is , obviously , if you want to know malaria , ask questions , your experience of your life .
If you want to know about the climate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ ologist .
But if you want to know what the two must be going first , you can &apos;t ask any of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
They gave it .
They &apos;re going to get that hard to say , we have to do first , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it
So this is the list , and this is the list , and this is the list that would want to share with you .
Of course , you can also see the web , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll be missing it as it goes the day .
B@@ as@@ i@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ el@@ abor@@ ate a list of these guys who were told there were projects — basically projects , projects where you inv@@ ade a , and you &apos;re less likely to take a look at it as a result .
They were the right projects , the good ones and the ch@@ ir@@ ts .
And so of course , they are the very good projects we should start by doing .
So let me start from last one way that we can start to finish with the best projects .
These are the mosquitos .
As you can see at the end of the list is changing climate change .
This off@@ ers many people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people will tell you should not go back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why did it come ?
And the truth , I &apos;ll also try to talk back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;re not talking about the li@@ sts that we &apos;ve written in .
The reason that worked on this is that K@@ y@@ go — or to do something more than K@@ ey@@ -@@ A — or doing something else that was a good business , because it &apos;s very in@@ efficient .
It &apos;s not saying that global global warming .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that we can do it by a very little cost , a very high cost .
What we basically showed you , the media , the media , the media models , and that K@@ ey@@ -@@ , the world has been shown by 15@@ 0,000 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a important amount of money .
Two times the global help of the development we have to do with the Third World every year .
And to do a little bit well .
All models show that you can see the he@@ els of six years , and then we go down to 2@@ 100 .
So a guy in Bang@@ lad@@ esh that will be suc@@ ked up to a floo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can wait to 2@@ 10 .
What &apos;s something good , but not very well .
So the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something .
And just by giving a refer@@ r@@ ence , the U.N. estimates that the number of a half , a billion dollars a year , could solve all the main main problems in the world .
We could make water , sanitation , sanitation , basic mental health and education all the human beings on the planet .
So we should ask , we would ask , &quot; &quot; What should we spend ? &quot; &quot; So we should then be asked to spend out of how to spend very little questions ?
Or half of it doing something fairly much good ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out that it &apos;s wrong .
It &apos;s not saying that we had all the money in the world , we didn &apos;t want to do it .
La@@ stly , when we don &apos;t , we just don &apos;t have the first pri@@ orities .
The right projects — I &apos;m not going to comment on it — but it &apos;s really empowering to make basic wisdom , but it &apos;s a bit of it , just because , it &apos;s a little bit , just because , because , it &apos;s a very big thing .
I would be a lot of good , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also , but it also
Once , it &apos;s a place that we all came together and suddenly started thinking about two sides of the equation .
If we look at the great projects , they showed a lot of projects from sanitation .
Once more , sanitation and water is an important thing , but it &apos;s also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four main main main main , should be , when fewer than solving , the first to solve when we &apos;re supposed to solve the problems of the world .
The greatest thing is malaria — it &apos;s malaria — treating malaria .
The inci@@ sion inci@@ sion of malaria is about a couple of millions of people infected each year .
It could even cost a copyright point of GDP over the year to the native native population .
If we put a 13@@ -year-old plus three billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce the inci@@ sion of the scale .
We could avoid death by 50,000 people , but the most important qu@@ iz@@ za is , we could prevent a billion people infected with each year .
We would create significant amounts of information to address many other problems that have to deal with , and it &apos;s been really the long-term global global warming .
The third one is the li@@ d-@@ eating .
B@@ as@@ tically , the model has shown that if we were able to detect the li@@ d-@@ eating , and especially by taking the Internet &apos;s help and Europe , we could basically elev@@ ate global economy into the middle of the year , half of the cal@@ ories of the World Third World .
Once we could actually take over 200 or 300 million people from poverty , we could actually take 200 or 300 million people from two and five years .
That would be the third one thing we could do .
The second thing was to be focusing to be focusing on the des@@ n@@ ate .
No mal@@ nutrition in general , self-@@ reli@@ ably a way to treat mal@@ nutrition , is to say , the lack of micro@@ re@@ b@@ ants .
B@@ as@@ tically , half of the world &apos;s population has been missing , z@@ e@@ c , i@@ dio@@ tic and vit@@ amin A.
If we put it out of 12@@ 0,000 dollars , we could make a deep in@@ qu@@ or@@ ative in that problem .
This would be the second reverse reverse engine we could do .
And the best project would be to be a cancer for HIV / AIDS .
B@@ as@@ tically , if we put 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could prevent 28 million of the new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this makes and what if it &apos;s a cen@@ so@@ ous thing to say that we have two different shapes like treating HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is predic@@ ting and the other is predic@@ tive .
Once a better , a ideal world , we would make the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t make any of the two or where we don &apos;t make it so well , we should , when fewer than we were to invest first .
And the treatment is a lot , much more expensive than prevent .
So basically , in the last one , this is a focus on what this is about to say we can do a lot more investing in the prevent .
B@@ as@@ tically to the amount of money we spend . We can do this by treatment , and 10 times more than prevent .
So once we had more , we have priori@@ tized focus more than the first option in treatment , as first op@@ o@@ logically .
What this makes us do is it really makes us think of our pri@@ orities .
And I &apos;d like you to look at your three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half-@@ year list and say , well , you know ?
or would come to something like we did here ?
Well , I &apos;m surprised , one of the things that is again changing climate change .
So many people who think it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very little likely to do that .
We should do it , we should make climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t solve all the odds .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to make sure is that if we focus on the problems , we &apos;re focusing on the most right .
So we can do a lot more well .
And I think , the fact — Thomas Sch@@ hel@@ ling , one of the participants of the n@@ ate , the first explained , very well .
One of the things that people are naked , and that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of climate change , people will be a lot more , much more rich .
Even the sta@@ tionary sta@@ kes in the most fish@@ er@@ men of the U.N. population has more pes@@ si@@ mi@@ stic .
esti@@ mation that a media person in the developing world is not as rich as we are today .
And much more likely to be , they &apos;re going to be about two to four times the rich@@ est of what we are .
And of course , we will be even more rich than that .
But the thing is , when we talk about saving people , we &apos;re helping people in Bang@@ lad@@ esh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bang@@ lad@@ ose .
We &apos;re talking about a very rich Dutch bli@@ des .
And so the real thing , naturally , that is , we want to spend a lot of money to do a little bit , about 10 years , a little bit of a lot of money ?
We want to help the poor people , these things , in Bang@@ lad@@ esh , who we want to help people , these t@@ apes , in Bang@@ lad@@ esh , who needs to help us , and who can help us to help them .
Or as the G@@ hel@@ ling Sch@@ hel@@ ling said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be rich as a rich , a rich campaign , a rich campaign , a rich campaign , a 3@@ 100 te@@ mple in the 2@@ 100 , and said , &quot; &quot; how is it to be interested so hard to help me , and my great-@@ grandmother , who could have helped to help me , and my great-@@ grandmother , who could have helped to have a little bit of this topic , and that &apos;s the need to
Even if I don &apos;t agree with the typical of seeing this problem .
Of course , it &apos;s fundamentally because climate change has a lot of good photos .
You know , you know , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s &quot; &quot; — it seems great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I want to see , right , but I don &apos;t think that sty@@ lish I can do with the Internet , the Internet , the Internet , the Internet , or something like this . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s just not for a movie .
So in many ways , I think I think of Co@@ ca@@ ha@@ h@@ en and the whole discussion about pri@@ orities is a def@@ ensive problem of the pri@@ orities .
To the after@@ math we realized that it &apos;s not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but not just to make us feel good , but
It &apos;s not going to do the things that are the greatest del@@ usi@@ on@@ al attrac@@ ting , but it &apos;s also going to do the things that are the greatest del@@ usi@@ on@@ ic del@@ ination , but it &apos;s also going to do a lot of way to do that .
The other goals , I think , who are important , is that of some man@@ ure , is that there &apos;s some sort of pe@@ t@@ d-@@ up .
We must be doing it all over a ideal world — it would be completely completely .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 19@@ 70 , the developed world decided we were going to spend the donor of what we &apos;ve done , right now , that in 19@@ 70 the developing world .
Like our help , it goes down to half .
It doesn &apos;t seem like we are in the way to solve all the major problems .
So in the same way , people would also say , but there &apos;s a war of Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion d@@ ams of d@@ os@@ es . Why don &apos;t we spend that way in the world .
I &apos;m totally sure .
If one of you can talk to B@@ ush to make it , it &apos;s okay .
But of course , the subject of the to@@ dd@@ ler is saying , if you had a other 100 billion dollars , you would have had to really want to be a better way of the best possible , right ?
So the real problem , is the real problem , and think , are the right pri@@ orities .
Should I mention a brief , really the right list ?
You know , when I ask questions about the best economists of the world , it &apos;s probably not just the white men and old victims of the United States , and the United States , and the U.S.
And they &apos;re not necessarily necessarily a really cool way to look at the world .
So we inj@@ ected 80 young men from all the world to solve the same problem .
The only two requi@@ rements were that they were studying in college , and they &apos;re talking English .
Most of them were , first of them , in the developing world .
They had the same material , but they could even get away from the subject of the discussion of the discussion , how they did it , to put their own li@@ sts .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with mal@@ nutrition and illness in the most high-@@ tech and climate change .
We have done this many other times .
There &apos;s a lot of other se@@ men and colle@@ ge@@ ances and data and different things .
They all had as a result of the same list .
And that &apos;s the thing about the big hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a way to think that there &apos;s a way forward to the age of our pri@@ orities . And saying , what &apos;s the most important world ?
It &apos;s in a ideal world , it would be the ideal world , would you take it all .
But if we don &apos;t do it all , we can begin to think where we start ?
I see the Con@@ m@@ els of C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen as a process .
We &apos;ve done in 2004 , and we hope to take a lot more people , to get a lot better information in 2008 , in 2012 .
Un@@ der the way that the world &apos;s right to the world , but also to think about it in political v@@ uni@@ ation .
To start thinking , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t do things in which we can win a little cost , and we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we &apos;re going to do this gene where we can do a big well , the low cost , right now . At the end of the day , you can really priori@@ tize the discussion of the discussion of how we really priori@@ tize , but we have to be honest and chicken to say , if there &apos;s some things we do , we have others
If we care a lot about some things , we end up not to care about others .
So I hope that this will help us make the pri@@ orities better , and think how we work better for the world .

A few years ago , I broke out of the house without keys .
It just was going to go home to the house , and a friend to the city , because that temperature co@@ ises the two scales .
And I was in the stand@@ ar@@ al , sear@@ ched and realized that I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , he could see the fi@@ xing on the table &apos;s desk table , where the left .
But they were all s@@ cat@@ tered .
I couldn &apos;t walk the night in my friend because the morning soon had a flight , and he needed to take a dogs and the suitcase .
So desper@@ ate and death of Colum@@ bus a cas@@ set@@ te and I got a wal@@ let of a wal@@ let and a pet pic@@ ket to the window .
I was going to run a lot of money , but I don &apos;t even think it &apos;s a little foot in the middle of the night .
Well , I &apos;m de@@ e@@ ming the science of science and science , and I &apos;m not just like science , and I &apos;m going to give science to neuroscience .
It domin@@ ates of p@@ itch@@ hi@@ ks , which elev@@ ates the rate of the ni@@ p@@ al@@ ine , the tw@@ i@@ al@@ ine rate of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine the ni@@ p@@ al@@ ine rate of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine the ni@@ p@@ al@@ ine .
So the next morning when I raised myself in a little bit , I worried about the fi@@ ve@@ d-@@ looking , worried that I was in Europe , and the commit@@ tee that I had in Europe had the mind of the naked mind .
And until he got out of the airport , I didn &apos;t realize I forgot to forget about the dogs .
So I &apos;ll go back quickly to home , and then I go back 40 minutes , and I go back to 40 minutes , and I come back to the airport and I came back to the time , but I gave my sense to another person , but I gave my sense to another person , but I &apos;m not a little bit of my other person &apos;s time , but I &apos;m not a little bit of the other person , but I &apos;m not going to make my sense of other person &apos;s time ,

It was something that took from the psycho@@ logist &apos;s psycho@@ logist &apos;s training that written about this a few years ago , and that &apos;s also called it &apos;s going to die .
It &apos;s a team of experts that try to determine why it &apos;s going to determine what happens , right ?
Because in the mor@@ ph@@ on@@ al recovery , as it explained D@@ an@@ ny , and then try to determine what you can do to do to make it better .
What I want to talk to you about today is what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do about what we can do
Some things are just evi@@ d@@ enced , other people not so much .
I &apos;m going to start by the ev@@ acu@@ um .
Dis@@ cover places all the way home to things that are easily lost .
Well , this seems like common sense , and it &apos;s so this that it &apos;s so common , and it &apos;s so this that it seems like this , and it &apos;s so much that it &apos;s so common , and it &apos;s so much that it &apos;s so common , and it &apos;s so much that it &apos;s so common , and it &apos;s so much that it &apos;s so common , and it &apos;s so much that it &apos;s so common , and it &apos;s so much that it &apos;s so common , and it &apos;s
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remember the pin@@ point of things , where it &apos;s the pige@@ ons , where you live , where you live , where the tribes and your enemies .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain of the brain brain is the brain part of the brain of brain .
It &apos;s part of the brain of the brain of brain is the brain part of the brain of brain is the brain part of the brain of brain is the brain .

But it works well with things that you don &apos;t move too much , not with things you move .
So there &apos;s a place that &apos;s called the keys to the keys .
To walk , a specific glass of a specific box , a specific glass of reading , a specific table , a specific table .
If you put a place and you &apos;re going to go to a place and get it into your place when you look at it .
And when we travel ? It &apos;s a picture with the lan@@ e , the lan@@ e , a photo with the lan@@ e , and when we go to the cell ?
I would take a shot with the photo to the naked eye .
These seem seem like it &apos;s ev@@ o@@ ked things .

The number should be one . My doctor didn &apos;t have to rec@@ ess something that doesn &apos;t help me .

They were going to go back into a virtual world world .
And it &apos;s not given to go back to the world and to regi@@ ster .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
Kids are first to their father &apos;s first to their father &apos;s first to their father &apos;s first to their father &apos;s first to their father &apos;s first to their father &apos;s first to their father .
So when I was born , I was going to say , &quot; &quot; This is going to go , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; This is going to work , &quot; &quot; and I have been a little girl who didn &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; H@@ oo@@ d@@ is is y@@ ou@@ th@@ ur , hon@@ ey . &quot;
What is the phenomenon that &apos;s going on in the mind of the baby ?
If we asked this about 30 years , most of people , psychologists , including , would say this baby is ir@@ rational , logical , logical , e@@ ver@@ ge ... that I wouldn &apos;t have to tell somebody else &apos;s perspective or not even understand a process of predic@@ tive .
In the last 20 years , science science has completely been this theory .
We believe , we believe that this baby &apos;s thought is like the most remarkable thinking of the most remarkable scientists .
I &apos;ll give you an example of this .
One thing that might be thinking this baby is that this baby , that it could be a little bit of this baby , it might be to be able to dis@@ semin@@ ate what it &apos;s happening in mind another baby .
So finally , one of the most difficult things to all of us is to try to dis@@ gust what other people think and feel like .
And maybe the most difficult thing is to understand that what others think and feel it &apos;s not the same as we think it &apos;s about it .
One , anybody who &apos;s so much about policy can say the hard thing that &apos;s going on to some people .
We want to know if babies and children are small could understand this very complex idea about other people .
So , the thing is , how can we ask you ?
Kids don &apos;t talk about it , and if we ask a child three years of back to the coun@@ ts , what thinks we will only be able to make a mon@@ on@@ on@@ an and a memory of thoughts .
How can we then ask you ?
It &apos;s the secret that the secret was the wi@@ gh@@ ion .
B@@ es@@ ey R@@ ap@@ ch@@ ol@@ i , one of my students , and I , we gave them the two pla@@ ins with food : a back@@ up , and the other one , we gave them the two pla@@ ins with food .
Every baby , even in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , like the B@@ k@@ el@@ ey , like the can@@ n@@ ies and don &apos;t like the browser .
( Laughter ) So then what I was doing was to do this for the two squ@@ ared food for two squ@@ ared .
And I would like to like to put it or not what he was .
Hal@@ der half of the time , he was like the h@@ alls and not the br@@ on@@ k@@ i — like any baby or normal person .
But the other half , he had a little bit of bre@@ a@@ gh@@ o@@ i and said , &quot; &quot; M@@ om@@ ma , wi@@ gh@@ ion .
I called the bre@@ ech@@ o@@ i . M@@ om@@ mm . &quot; &quot; And then you took a gall@@ ery , and he said , &quot; &quot; A@@ m , you can &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ve called the ex@@ le@@ ys . &quot; &quot; So I picked up the date . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s going to say , it was like a other way to like the other babies who liked babies .
We did this with babies from 15 and 18 months .
Then B@@ ep@@ y was the hand and said , &quot; &quot; Don me a little bit ? &quot;
So , the thing about this was : I would give babies babies what would like they liked to them or she ?
The surprising thing was that babies &apos; age of 18 months , they end up to walk and talk , gives them the chicken to you like the can@@ t@@ le@@ ys and the browser if you like the bre@@ m@@ i bre@@ ed .
On the other hand , the 15@@ months , the 15@@ months of the last few months of the first place that I &apos;d like to have the wi@@ gh@@ ion , as if you couldn &apos;t get the bra@@ ke , as if you couldn &apos;t get it .
And then we looked at it for a long mouse , we &apos;re going to get rid of the world that thought would you like the whole world .
So there &apos;s two data data now re@@ revealed this .
On one side is that babies &apos; age of 18 months have already found that important human nature of human nature : we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , understood that it &apos;s going to help to help other people to help other people who want them .
And more interesting , it &apos;s that babies from 15 months don &apos;t do this ; which suggests that the age of 18@@ 3 months learned this profound act of being a profound act of being a single hu@@ gely hu@@ gely hu@@ gely hu@@ gely hu@@ gely gor@@ geous of the age of three months .
So babies know more and more you have to learn more than we think about it .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that have been done in the last 20 years , demonstr@@ ating this accompli@@ shment .
What if you can ask now , why kids learn so much ?
And how is it possible that they learn so much so little ?
I mean , the first babies , babies seem quite in@@ n@@ ate .
And in many times , they are worse than they are , because we have to use a lot of time and energy just in the lives of living .
If we re@@ heal evolution to look at this mystery of why we lost so much of that we lost so much of our health care , it turns out that there &apos;s a response to the very best of the babies , and it turns out that there &apos;s a response that &apos;s an answer that we lost so much of our time .
If we look at the species , not just other pri@@ orities like us , not just other pri@@ orities like us , but also other mam@@ mo@@ s like us , birds , even oxy@@ me@@ stic like the can@@ dy or the relative size and the intelligence of the species and the intelligence of the species .
One example of this cap@@ tain this stuff you can see here .
So a band of New Cal@@ ed@@ ery was the cor@@ e@@ tic New Cal@@ e@@ c@@ ose of New Cal@@ e@@ a .
The cor@@ ners and other cor@@ ri@@ cal , cave , che@@ ap@@ ly , are the very smart ones .
In the right senses are so smart as the chimpanzees .
And this is a very studied , a sp@@ y , that has learned how to use food .
On the other hand , we have our domestic co@@ al@@ ties .
The g@@ lim@@ mers , like the duc@@ ks , and all the ge@@ eks , are just like stones .
I &apos;m very small , but it &apos;s not very good to do anything else , but it &apos;s not very good to do anything else .
It turns out that the babies of New Cal@@ e@@ a , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its , the p@@ its
And it dep@@ ended that your n@@ up@@ al is actually dependent on that your mom@@ s , you depend on that your mom@@ s , the two-@@ dimensional worms , the two-@@ dimensional worms , the very few years in the short life life , the one that &apos;s going to make the difference in a bird &apos;s life .
I mean , the g@@ lim@@ mers are adults in just a couple of months .
So the childhood is the reason that the cor@@ al@@ ties are the reason that the cor@@ n@@ ation of scientific re@@ vie@@ wers are aff@@ lic@@ ted in the potential of the soup .
There &apos;s something in the long eigh@@ t-@@ long childhood that seems to be related to knowledge and learning .
What would we explain to this ?
Some animals , like the Gree@@ ks , they seem to have changed something very well .
So the g@@ lim@@ mers are very good bite in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like the cor@@ ners , are not particularly good to doing this particular , but they &apos;re very good learning the norms of different things .
And of course , we have the humans we are very far in that distribu@@ te .
We have more big brains with our bodies , much more than any other animal .
More smarter than , more intelligent , we can learn more , we can survive many more in@@ or@@ n here : we have em@@ bas@@ sy all the planet and even face space .
And our babies and children depend on us for a lot longer than babies are species .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) So until 23 , we followed them those ver@@ bs in their open mou@@ ths in their open mou@@ ths .
All right , so we look good at this string ?
One idea is that this strategy , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way to ad@@ versity in this world , and it &apos;s a very powerful way to ad@@ j@@ ose this world .
It turns out that it &apos;s even an un@@ defen@@ sible , if you &apos;re un@@ aware it &apos;s all you learned , if you &apos;re in@@ defen@@ sible .
I wouldn &apos;t be good enough that you can be used to be used to be a n@@ un@@ ge and be thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve gained a sho@@ ck@@ -up or a joint . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s going to be a little bit better ?
I would be better aware of all that before you get the mat@@ ch@@ al@@ ers .
And the way that evolution has evolved this problem was it seems like a job , a job .
So we have this long time in what we &apos;re totally protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . It &apos;s just to learn .
And then , of adults , we can take that that we have to take that we learn from babies and children and put it in practical to the world .
One way of thinking about this is that babies and kids are like the In@@ v@@ esti@@ gation and the E@@ liz@@ a@@ be@@ th Develop@@ ment and Develop@@ ment of human species .
They are the people who are protected , the ones that they only have to get to to get , to learn and have good ideas . And we are the production of commerci@@ alization .
We have to take all of these ideas that we have to have children and put them in practical .
Another way of seeing it is , instead of thinking about babies and children as in@@ complete , thinking about them as being a different development state of the same species ; like the cas@@ set@@ tes and the pel@@ ets , the babies were going to fight the but@@ t around the garden explo@@ itation , and we would be the babies of the air that the house was going to be exploring .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution showing us that the kids are going to learn , we can hope it &apos;s a lot of learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the computer of learning the most powerful part of the planet .
But the real computers are constantly improving a lot .
There &apos;s a revolution in our brain to understand the learning machines .
And all of the ideas of this man , the rever@@ sing Thomas B@@ y@@ n@@ es , a statistical act of the 18@@ th century .
B@@ as@@ i@@ ally , B@@ ay@@ es gave a mathematical decline that emplo@@ yed used the theory that emplo@@ ying the theory of probability and describe the way scientists found things in the world .
What scientists do is we have to deliver a hypothesis , something we can begin to start .
So then it &apos;s going to be that chance that chance .
The evidence is going to change the hypothesis , but the evidence will change the hypothesis , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the evidence will change the way , but the
I &apos;ll come back to the e@@ ver@@ u@@ ous with new tests , and so I &apos;ll get a little bit .
What the Ba@@ kers showed was a mathematical dem@@ o that I could do that .
And the math is the basis of the best programs of learning that we have today .
Seven years ago , I found that babies must be doing the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s going on under these beautiful eigh@@ t-@@ tw@@ ards , I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s very much like that .
I found myself in the grades of rever@@ sing B@@ y@@ son , the found in the grades of rever@@ sing B@@ y@@ n@@ es .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculations with the odds that they look like and so discover how the world works .
Well , this is even more peaceful than demonstr@@ ating .
If we ask the adult brain on statistics , it &apos;s going to feel very stupid .
How is that kids do that kids do statistics ?
To test this , we use a machine we gave to call the D@@ et@@ tor B@@ lic@@ k@@ et .
It &apos;s a box that turns out that it &apos;s a box that &apos;s going to take a look at it , and it &apos;s a box that &apos;s determined .
So by using this very simple machine in my lab , and also in other , if you &apos;ve done research , the good thing is , the good thing is that the kids learn about the world .
And I &apos;ve shown you just one that we did with T@@ u@@ ar K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , one of my students .
If this detector probably probably started to think that the way that activ@@ ating is to put it on a block that &apos;s about the detector .
But the case is that detection works in a way that &apos;s so much fun .
If you open a block that &apos;s going on , something you don &apos;t think about a beginning , the detector are not thinking at a beginning , the detector are two times every three times .
It &apos;s going to be you put the blo@@ gs on the block , which would be the logical thing , just if it &apos;s a two-@@ dimensional , just two times .
So the less likely that has more liber@@ ated evidence is more evi@@ den@@ sed .
It looks like the tex@@ ture of the opening of the object is more effective than the other .
So we explain this data to the kids about four and we gave them to try .
And with security , the world &apos;s children , the four years , and they opened the object on the detector .
There &apos;s two interesting data data on this .
The first one , remember that two years ago , I was about four years old , and the first one , I remember that I are about four years old , and the first one , I remember that I are about four years old , and I was just four years old , and the first one , I remember that I are about four years old , and I was a four-@@ year old , and I &apos;m a four-@@ year old , but I &apos;m a four-@@ year eigh@@ t-@@ year-old , but I &apos;m
They are learning to count ; they &apos;re learning to count ; they &apos;re learning to count .
But it seems un@@ consciously , that they &apos;re actually making a measure of par@@ tici@@ pat@@ ory .
The second interesting thing is that they &apos;re using the evidence to get the evidence to get a sense , a hypothesis about the world , which seems like a little bit of a bit of a very familiar plan .
In the study we do that in the lab , other species , we &apos;ve shown that these kids of four years are better than the adults , given the same task .
In these circum@@ stance , kids do statistics to see things about the world , but scientists scientists are trying to see if we were all tried .
It &apos;s what we often call &quot; &quot; met@@ ap@@ mic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s been many interested in this thing that they showed that these games are like a kind of experim@@ ental research program .
We show one of the C@@ up@@ b@@ ine laboratory from the C@@ le@@ ck lab .
It &apos;s emplo@@ yers like the new D@@ et@@ t@@ ese D@@ et@@ t@@ ec@@ ket .
It showed the kids that were going to work and the ver@@ bs don &apos;t , and the ver@@ bs don &apos;t , and they &apos;re showing them a un@@ safe .
What we &apos;re going to see now is this boy by five hypothe@@ ses in two minutes in two minutes .
N@@ ace : So ?
N@@ ine@@ ty-@@ seven : I@@ gu@@ al that on the other side .
Al@@ ready : Well , the first hypothesis is to determine it .
N@@ N : No . ( Laughter ) N@@ ine@@ ty-@@ seven : This turns out , but this is not .
Al@@ ready : It starts to describe experim@@ entation .
( Laughter ) N@@ ine@@ ty-@@ born : Why is this if you go ?
( Laughter ) N@@ N : Don &apos;t go .
Al@@ ready : scientists are sequ@@ enced that face face to learn that face .
( Laughter ) N@@ N : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be so , and this has to be that .
Al@@ ready : L@@ ama , a hypothesis that &apos;s two .
N@@ N : So it has to be .
N@@ N : Oh ... can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) Al@@ ready : Now it comes the next idea .
He asked the researcher who try to put it on the other .
I just worked .
N@@ N : Oh , it &apos;s because light only goes up here , right here .
He said this box there is electricity , but this has no .
Al@@ ready : Well , that would be the chance that chance .
N@@ N : Now yeah .
If you add four blocks .
If you add four blocks in this , you ac@@ cess@@ ed and two to the other one &apos;s re@@ cen@@ tered .
Al@@ ready : Well , that &apos;s the ultimate farm .
This child is — it &apos;s a little boy , a boy , a little boy , and the P@@ em@@ b@@ ine found that it &apos;s a very typical child .
If we look at how we &apos;re playing the kids , if we ask that , to do something , what do they do is to experiment .
I was typical of the age of 4 .
Well , what do you feel like this type of creature ?
What if one of these little tu@@ ets that can test five hypothe@@ ses in two minutes ?
If we come back from the theory of psychologists and philosop@@ hers , I think that babies and children are just conscious , or even if they &apos;re not all really , it &apos;s not all the very absolute things .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more conscious than adults .
This is what we know about how the adult connec@@ tive connec@@ tive .
The awareness and attention of an adult will take focus .
What happens in the adults is that when we decide something important or relevant , we &apos;re just given attention .
The awareness of what we &apos;re doing is that realistic and intense , mentally that the rest of the most un@@ ited is .
We also know how it &apos;s happening in the brain .
When we care about something , the brain regions , the part that the actions , the part that the actions , the brain , the signal that makes a small part of the brain that makes a little bit of the brain infl@@ ection , if it &apos;s more diverse than it &apos;s the brain .
We have so much cen@@ so@@ red attention , gui@@ ded by purpose .
If we look at babies and kids , we see something very different .
I think babies and kids seem to have a much more like a tor@@ ch on a l@@ oc@@ re .
So babies and children are very hard to limit the attention to one thing .
But it would give you a lot of information to account for a lot of sources of energy .
And if you look at your brains , what you see is that it &apos;s a soldier &apos;s soldier that induc@@ ed the learning and the plas@@ tic@@ ity , and the whole thing that we have to do is not lead .
So when we say babies and children are problems to pay attention , what really means is they &apos;re going to cost them to their attention .
They were going to get to the very interesting things that could say something like it &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the type of attention , the kind of connec@@ tors that we have to expect those but@@ t@@ ers who are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a way of feeling that kind of child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child , I think the best way is to think about cases where we are at a new situation we haven &apos;t been never before ; every time we &apos;re going to be a city for the first time .
In those cases the science doesn &apos;t hire contrac@@ ep@@ tion , but it &apos;s that it &apos;s going to be it , so it seems like in three days in Paris , there &apos;s more connec@@ tors and experience that every single months in the house , then walking , talking to the cl@@ om@@ sy as a zo@@ om@@ is .
For a little , that exact coffee that we take below , actually imp@@ or@@ ting the effect of the neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ mission &apos;s effect .
So how is it a baby ?
It &apos;s like being a girl@@ friend , in Paris , after taking three ex@@ ac@@ ant off@@ ers .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling of wonderful , but you &apos;ll expect to cry at 3 of the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s okay to be an adult .
I don &apos;t mean to say too much about the magnificent ones are babies .
It &apos;s okay .
We can do things like d@@ are , but we can do things like d@@ are or crossing the street .
And it has meaning that we put a lot of effort to do that babies as adults as adults .
But if we want it to be like these t@@ apes , having the mind open , being open , being open , being open , will be open , and perhaps , at least sometimes , we have to make adults think to the adults as a child .

I &apos;m here to share my cous@@ in .
Does this picture ?
Because of course , this is a picture that can &apos;t take your cameras .
So , my whole school , the picture he started when I was able to my first digital camera to 15 .
I looked at my fore@@ head , and I was a little bit different , because by using the camera the process was more well in the plan@@ tation .
And when a picture of a photograph was a picture , the process ended up when it was pre@@ mature .
To me the picture I had to photograph I was more to see it in the ver@@ ge , in the old no@@ ble moment .
It seemed like anybody could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process is starting to the pulse .
I mean , a building a building on a very trans@@ action .
But it has a unexpected d@@ run@@ g .
And yet it stays a re@@ alism of re@@ alism .
Or photos like these — dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all of the common objective of keeping the level of re@@ alism .
When I say re@@ alism , I &apos;m saying , well , I can &apos;t go back and I can &apos;t .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can be captured , but I always want you to look like it , but I always want you to look like it , like a picture .
I &apos;m going to think about it , a moment to think about the tru@@ ce .
So this has more to see that it has more to see a sense that we can capture a really really .
But what is the trick that makes sound real ?
You have to see the details or the colors ?
Do you have to see with light ?
What do we create the illusion ?
The point is the illusion .
But at the end of our own , it &apos;s about the way that interpre@@ ting the world and how can be lost on a surface and two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not about whether it &apos;s realistic but what we think is realistic .
So I think the bas@@ ics are very simple .
I &apos;ve had a cre@@ ep like a cre@@ am of reality in which we take different perspectives of reality and we &apos;re giving up to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
So here we have three different physical objects , something that we can all relate to living in a three-dimensional world in three-dimensional world .
But comb@@ ating in a way that can create something that still looks like three-dimensional .
But at the same time , we know that there can &apos;t be there .
So we &apos;re going to end up our brain because the brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it &apos;s really no meaning .
And I can see the same process as I combine it .
It &apos;s also in comb@@ ality of different realities .
So the things that make a picture of a picture looks like , I think , are those ones that don &apos;t even even think ; the things that are ar@@ as@@ ing in our lives would be .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to consider this . Because unlike this , it seems to seem like a fairly bizar@@ re way .
So I &apos;d like to say there &apos;s three simple answers that we follow to achievement and to get realistic results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But comb@@ ining , can create something like this .
So the first one is that the first one is that the photos actually actually stopped having the same view .
And secon@@ dly , the bl@@ ended photos of the same kind of light .
And these two pictures are under@@ gradu@@ ating with these requi@@ rements ; they have been taken to the same time and the same type of light .
The third point is to make sure that the third point is going to be able to dis@@ gust the same imagery of a perfect uni@@ on .
It has to be impossible to say how if you eat the picture in reality .
So by doing the color , the contrast and the shine of the edges of the lines that there are among the different imagery , by adding phot@@ osy@@ n@@ ic features like depth of the brain , and you make it like a sound such a picture , but it &apos;s made a picture , but it &apos;s actually a picture , but it &apos;s actually a kind of really a picture of it , but it &apos;s made hundreds of things , but it &apos;s actually a kind of really a picture of it , but it
This is another example .
( Laughter ) You could think this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is what was a manipul@@ ated .
But this picture is completely e@@ ver@@ fied by photograp@@ hers of different places .
I &apos;m thinking that it &apos;s easier to create a place that found that it &apos;s going to be a place that found out , because one can &apos;t actually comprom@@ ise the ideas that has in your mind .
But this requires this re@@ stra@@ itation .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew I had several months to plan , to find different places for the focus of the day@@ -to-@@ head .
For example , the fish was captured on a way to catch fish .
The back is a different set of this .
The su@@ pre@@ me part was captured in a stone pop@@ y pop@@ corn .
And yeah , even I have been red the entire room from the island of il@@ si@@ bly , that would be more deadly .
So to get a realistic result , I think it &apos;s a realistic outcome , I think it &apos;s plan@@ d-@@ specific .
It &apos;s always going to be a little bit like a little bit .
So there &apos;s a little bit of how we combine the different pictures .
And there every piece is very well thought .
If a good job goes to take the photos the result can be beautiful and then very realistic .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that the clean in is our imagination .
Thank you .
