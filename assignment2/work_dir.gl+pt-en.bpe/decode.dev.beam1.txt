( Audio ) Reegem in Am Sater , the bad man . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; So , I &apos;m sorry .
( Laughter ) I had a media family of media .
My father was five years ago when he lost his father , but when he was born , he was a man of business .
If your children were children or boys , if their children were children or boys , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , they were children or girls , and they were going to school .
So I suppose I was saving my own savings .
Mitting mother was a pupquo .
Depression 16 , we &apos;re alive .
You can imagine why I had to pass when it was a girl .
They were going to be transported to the cemetery , or the child being used to a tutarian .
At that moment , when I finished the institutionary , I wanted to be a doctor .
It was meant to help women and children .
So I finally found my education , the more he was going to college .
I was in my country , there &apos;s no praying for women in the middle of the world , even though they accepted me in medical school , couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father sent me to America .
In America .
I took my studies .
Lusor to death was my education , Rausia invaded my country .
You know ? When I was finishing my class , I found myself , I found what I was going to happen to my family and my country .
They had months of months , and I didn &apos;t have bad news .
My family found out a refire-or-refire-blended bed field .
So I just finished the research , I brought my family to America .
I want you to be saved .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Aphomon .
Every day , when I first listened to the news , when I was following my country , I was going to go to the heart .
I was unstruck by going to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place to me .
I had a good job .
It was professional at a university .
I was expected .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could make it .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my own fox .
So I had to get back to the refixes .
And when I came to the field of Pakista , I was seven and seven million miles a half and a half million restrained .
Deach , black and white women are women and children , but the men or they die in war or they were on their own . They know ?
When I was going to the journalist I was doing , I had to tell you things that I don &apos;t think .
I saw a visceral with five kids , sitting there sitting still sitting there sitting in the way .
I saw a new woman who had no new , no studies , or not income , or a place in living in the living .
They were going to have been lost their parents , their focus and that with 10 or seven years , had to pull out their families , be their head &apos;s head and intending their kids .
It was absolutely unlocking .
My heart had changed by my people and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So that moment , a lot of a impulse .
So I felt like , &quot; &quot; I felt I can do for these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m a person who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education changed my life .
He got me . He took me a position .
He had a trust . It was a career .
I &apos;m happy to pull me my family , take my family to another country , to make my family safe .
And at that moment I knew that I would have to provide my people to care and health and that was what I tried to do .
But think what was easy ?
Because , because of that , women don &apos;t have access to education .
So after the invention of Rusa in Apha , people don &apos;t care about anybody .
It was really hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; What do I do ?
Some of the states has come from the United States .
Somebody who raised you here .
They were in me ? Of course , not .
So what really needed was to win was to make it a way to trust this community .
How will I go to do it ?
I was documenting a while , I documented my eyes , I looked at me and I looked at it .
Don &apos;t ask questions .
So finally , I found a man .
He was 80 years old .
It was a mere mere mthere .
He &apos;s going to be his tender in the pelvis and I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I want to become a teacher .
And I looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Thy , I &apos;m like you can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher , and I just started a lecture in the corner , and I would
So in a year , we had 25 kids installed , 15,000 kids going to school , and it was unbelievable .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
We were supposed to do our work , forming teachers , and they &apos;re going to be the most challenging teachers , and one day , and one day , we had all sorts of transformations . And one day , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be doing the kind of definition . And one day , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a kind of framework . And one day , you know , you know , you know , you
One day , I was in the Office in Fihaba , a day , I was in the Office in Fihar , Christine , a day , in the Office in Fihar , a day , I was in the Office in Fihar , Christine , a day , in the Office in Fihar , a day , I was in the Office in Fihar , Christine , a day ,
And then , suddenly I saw my personal cabat to the cuarbox , and suddenly I saw that my personal house was the curator , and I would swade it , and then I was the leader , being the leader , who do it ?
You &apos;re afraid . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on play .
But as a leader , you have to keep the composition .
You have to keep the composition and play it .
So I asked , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people accused in a mafiance .
So I invited them into the optics .
They lived . They went to nine times , nine takers .
They were the most horrors men they could see .
( Laughter ) Xly with a feast , the dark , black , beaten black , and you have been calculated in my office .
And I would have to sit and take a sandwich .
They didn &apos;t take it .
And of course , the ton of voice that employers would use a lot of fear , and I was really really affected .
But at the same time , I stayed with my own .
And of course , at that moment , you see as seeing as a swax , a hair of a black sleacb , and , of course , you see it , you see it as seeing as a swab , and , of course , you see it , you see it as seeing as a smiles by a black jab , and , of course , you see it , you see it as seeing as a smiles by a black sledge .
The only one that was going to see me was the eyes .
I wondered , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do
&quot; &quot; Don &apos;t know that school is going to be prohibiting women ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And you know ? &quot; &quot; And you looked at me and I wrote , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s
They watch some students . They all learn the Korean holy book .
You know ? The Koran says that if you study the women &apos;s holy book can be good wives , and you can obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s like you &apos;re going to go to the next bottle .
They talked about them and they said , &quot; &quot; We saw it , we &apos;re okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they know ? So I &apos;m going to please put it again and then they &apos;d put a glimmer and laughed .
I was given my personal staff to my office .
They were killed .
They didn &apos;t know me .
They didn &apos;t know me to get them .
So all of these were all of the worm fires .
I was happy and , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) And of course , I claim I &apos;m alive .
But also , as we are , we still poll the Taliban , when the Taliban had the power was another story .
We were sitting in the clinic and we teach the 80 girls , 3,000 students , to the ones we were asked to leave with .
The Taliban dropped from the Taliban , we went through the country and opened a school after another .
We open up education centers .
We open clinics without stop .
We work with women and children .
We face it about reproductive health .
We use how many types of formations can imagine .
I was so happy . I was a charming for my work .
And one day , when I was four polls and a gardum , I went north to North Kabul , suddenly a more time , and then they were given me back on the street , made the 19 kids .
With the logos to the logos , then blocking the road .
I asked my driver who came out and respond to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You want to go to the &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; My garage went up and said , &quot; &quot; We want to go to it . &quot; &quot; My garage &apos;s one of the left and said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t respond .
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said nothing and they call me .
At that moment , women were living inside the car .
I &apos;m very much affected by me and I mean , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
This time , you &apos;ll kill everybody .
She had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , then the moment comes up , then the whole thing comes out and what you do .
It &apos;s your heart .
I have been in your own , and you can follow it from that .
So I supported myself on a car side .
My leg treme and I went out of the car .
I mean , I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What can I help you ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Every day from one spot on one spot .
They were going to make them , and they also give them the chance to have a job .
Did you see it . What about the nomons ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What about the nomons ?
What we &apos;re going to do is do we ? &quot; &quot; Miret and rehearsal , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Okay .
We know , the only one we can do , the way we can do , the time we have to make us live , is to get a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . They know what it means .
It &apos;s obviously a tra .
So I left it and said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to marvel , marshes . &quot; &quot; And I went to the car , I sat down , and I sat down the driver , sat down , and he sat down the driver .
We only had money to teach them to be , to send them to school , and nothing else .
When I came to the office , obviously all the markers markers .
Look at your home . Nobody died .
My garage was the only one I was there , and I had a voice came out and I had no voice .
I was conmitted , sitting in my desk , and I said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;re already ready to take education in the north .
They were in the afterglow we teach them .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly we &apos;re here talking about impulses , because at that moment , one of my wonderful excites requests requests a report .
And I called me , &quot; &quot; Skennie ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What you &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . What you &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been diluking .
It was equal to what I said , I didn &apos;t believe me , and I was asking myself questions .
Okay , so I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m going to go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Okay , so I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , next door , you go and give them them .
He said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; And when I go , two days later , I did the same way , you know that ? They weren &apos;t there , they were not there , they were not there , they were going to get the same way , the same kids , there &apos;s going to be the rifie and the way to make the car .
So I stopped to see the car .
I came up and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , come to me . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah .
So I had the mosque to the mosque and to summarize , I would tell them that he had to put teachers .
Now , they are the greatest educators .
They learn English as being teachers , learn how to be teachers and are my guots .
All the areas that we don &apos;t know , in the mountain areas , they come to me . They go back and go .
And protects us .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education boils people .
When we educate people , they change and , in action , we need to work for equality .
You can &apos;t raise women and forget from men , because men are the people who read it , they &apos;re the people that read the most difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started to educate the people , because it &apos;s going to be conscious of women , knowing how to make men and that females can discharge the same jobs they have .
So we formed men continuously , and I believe deeply deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I truly believe , and I think it profoundly deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I truly believe in all these books we have continued to be really deeply and I truly believe , and I think it profoundly deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I truly believe in all these books we have continued to keep us alive and I believe , and I think it profoundly deeply and I believe deeply deeply and deeply I
I live in a country that I live in a country that I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful and beautiful country .
We go all the parts .
Women had education : women were savanathema , their teachers , and we had a house to another .
We won &apos;t close the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of the security problem .
But we still want the Apha of earlier .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now , the Shogga women are very , very hard .
Gradoubt . Foraha to be used .
They were to be a doctor , again .
They were to be initiative and run the business of business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people employing all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share it with you for love , for compassion , for the meaning of the honesty and the honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;ll succeed .
We have a poet , Mawleneea Himan .
He said that if compassion has been a love and if you have love , you can concep the world .
And I &apos;d say , we could .
And if we were able to be Afa , I &apos;m safe to the 100 percent that any can do all the world .
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Seven years ago I had a phone called the phone that changed my life .
So I was cardiovascular for the UCLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I was called it was a veteriny of the Zimbabwe of Los Angeles .
One old Lose is smart to paraphrase and the configuration of the status query and the tenderness that was a brain infected .
I wondered if I could go to the zoo to search for a possible cause .
It changes clear that the U.S. zoo are told with veteran equipped equipped and highly trusted that care about their own animals .
But sometimes , it would say , a medical community , especially for some specialized consultation , especially for some specific consultation , but sometimes it &apos;s going to make it , it &apos;s a specialized consultation , especially for some specific consultation , but sometimes it &apos;s going to make it , it &apos;s a specialized consultation , especially for some specific consultation , but sometimes it &apos;s going to make it , it &apos;s a specialized consultation , especially for some specific consultation , but sometimes
It &apos;s going to discharge the brain infertion of brain cancer in the case of this Neanderthals , and I ate that the pertude of this marionko was not misused . This is probably the case of this picture , but I ate that the maximum of this mariononan-American temple was not misused . Here I &apos;m going to go to the heart of a house and a medical school in what we extracted their heart .
And this procedures go , which has already been centered by many human patients , was everifying with the exception of the glasty and the glue .
I &apos;m talking about symptoms , discussions , diagnostic , diagnostics , diagnostics , medication and treatments for my human patients .
And when instead , in the same day , I was visiting at UCLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
And I started to see clearly one thing : one thing : I started to see this thing : one thing : I started to see this thing : I started to see this thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing one thing : I started seeing
We have to have psychiatric disorders , basically , doctors and the veterinos of the same patient in their human patients and animals , and the victims and the veterinonahic arteries of the same patient in their human patients and animals , and the veteran of the concedance of the same mental cancer , and animals , and the cametic arteries .
Well , I have to make a confession .
I still studied physiology and biology evolves during college — even I did my thesis about Darwin &apos;s theirs about Darwin — learning more about the significant measurement of animal disease and human age was a touch touch of it for me .
And I started asking myself how could it be , with all of these coinciations , that never gets me to a veterinary or a public consultarian plan , to have another perspective on one of my human patients ?
Did we assign never a veterininonable conference ?
But still , why should you be surprised ?
All the doctors accepted some of the biological connectors among animals and humans .
All the medicines we prescribe , we take or we give our families to be born before a animal .
But there &apos;s a big distinction between giving a brand animal or ingenuity a disease or insecurity that is a human animal , and that animal animal has a human heart , diabetes or cancer or cancer .
Maybe it &apos;s a part of the surprise of the separity of the separately that our world does between the city and the non-urban .
We &apos;re talking about these urban kids that think that the normal cell would grow in the trees or the quy-axis of a plant .
Hospitals of today are going to turn on day to turn closer on the technology of technology .
And this creates a psychological disorder between humans that are there are treated and the patients that live in the oceans and the animals that live in the ocean , in the granleties and the jungles .
But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason : But I think there &apos;s even a deeper reason
We have the doctors and scientists we accepted them , and scientists and scientists we accepted them , and the scientists and scientists we accepted them , is just a kind of a , even more , not only a single species , or any other new , no new new species than any other .
But in our inner way we don &apos;t end up .
I was sitting there when I &apos;m going to I go to Mozart or I see my MacBBs photos that made Mars Rosa .
I feel that called the human exception of human awareness , still by understanding the scientific costs of verbs as a kind of higher , part .
Well , but this teb is , I &apos;m trying to try to try .
Now , when I see the human patient , I always ask myself , &quot; What do doctors know ? &quot; &quot; So what do doctors do about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
How could it take better to my patient if you saw a human animal , and more of it , would you take better to my patient &apos;s patient if you saw a human animal ?
And here some examples of the subjects are connection to the connections that made me kind of a reasonable kind of interest .
It &apos;s just induced heart disease .
There are in the year 2000 , the human carders &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; found &quot; &quot; The
It was description in a secrecy father to the game that has lost the savings of the entire life of life on a starve of a abandoned air .
But it turns out that the new human diagnosis is not new and exclusive .
The veterinos had been diagnosed with instances , treating them and even predicts emotionally inducted in animals , from the mid-1990s .
How many human lives could save themselves if this veterinary rate was going to be the disproportionate of the pathologist &apos;s patient and the carologists ?
They are still .
Some human patients are severely .
They &apos;re used to be cut .
Some patients also have to do it themselves .
There are afterward that live in the way that they live in a way , and again , they &apos;re saving them as well .
But the veterinos are very specific shapes and effective and effective ways of treating and even autistic people like this .
It should not be that veterinary knowledge of psychopathic psychopaoters , parents and patients who fight with the authentitheraptions of the authentitheraption ?
It sent possession and psychosis of possession .
Sometimes , the little bit about giving a few women hunt in their hair , sometimes in severe psychotic , and even in psychotic states .
They can decline to decorate their own child &apos;s own , and in extreme cases , we can decline to reject it .
The camels of cabes know also that when once a cow , a little bit after the time , it can vibrate its copile , and we deniolate the almod and in some cases , like the air , and in some cases , pathogens to kill .
But the veterinese the idebles are going to address this particular slide of the police-copile syndrome .
oxytocin is the rots of crossing , and it causes the eaves-torded enrible .
It should not be this information by observers of observers and Victologists , from family physicians and the patients who are going to have to have the assumption and the psychopathetic psychopaths ?
Most of the promising estimates that this is all the way , the distrust between our bodies are being large .
To explain it , a lot of me have to put out some of the evidence that I &apos;m going to put together some of the evidence .
There are doctors who can be autistic by the professional professional speaker who are not high , but they are not just uncertain the other places in medicine .
I mean to the dentists , I chose to the dental and psychologists and psychologists , but especially the veterinos .
Of course , most doctors don &apos;t have a sense of that it &apos;s harder to get it in today in a moment of an Eternaire of Eve of an Eteria , and when we go to Medicine , we learned everything that &apos;s relevant to know about a species , the Homo sapiens . But the veterinos we learned about health and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the veterinent to the veteran of the condescending and ignoring of my professional fellow .
Here &apos;s a chuband of the veterinonian part : As if you call a veteran that only knows how to treat a species ?
Doctor Ademing this distrust away in my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through programs like Darwin on the UCLs , at UCLLLA. at the UCLLLA. OA. where we inject the experiment in animals and the evolution of evolution and our residents in our residents of our own backgrounds .
And through the ZeomaliquiquCity conferences , we were invited to the medical school of Momea and Vetera to keep collaborative and restraints of the shared and the trauma of shared by human patients and animals .
So by the San Zoeiquians conferenced subjects to learn how to treatment for cancer a cancer cancer can help us to treat cancer as a scientist &apos;s heart of a master of child &apos;s experience ; how to understand the humility and the very best way to the treatment of the stress of the cloud of child education ; how to understand the humility policing of a speech , which has been going to fit in the beginning of the clerks .
So in San Zogen conferences , first in the EE — and now all the world , doctors and veteran and informations they were given their active and predicts like colleagues , like a doctor .
In the end , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s already time that we have , doctors , and we &apos;re unaware of the veterinas in a health approach to the health of the species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and most humanities are being praying by doctors who have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways of treating human patient is practical to a lot of attention as every other other patient on the planet , grow , and they walk .
Thank you very much .

It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here the word &quot; &quot; the key &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; was . &quot; &quot; Uff !

You saw , &quot; &quot; What I did to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Piano Peletor ) ( Laughter ) We saw , &quot; &quot; I can change this thing in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You saw , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something that can do ?
There &apos;s some other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the good guys in all these cases , because they &apos;re very professional and compromised with their university .
But they are also too used to treating patients , so I would tell you sometimes , and I would say , literally , you know , a torture of a book . &quot; &quot; Interestingly means that we are not used to treat it , and that &apos;s a kind of a kind of progeny .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical is that they avoid it in any way to know your situation , to make a difference in your family and friends or teach some way to modify your lifestyle , to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going to pass .
But with all , this way , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re going to pick up in your hands from a very professional dog .
Whereas I was in the hospital , I asked myself to impede my thumb from my cuscer .
It was really hard to get it , because it &apos;s not very familiar to me to your own .
I talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m okay , I don &apos;t tell me .
I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , whether it &apos;s what it &apos;s like to walk around my whole . &quot; &quot; So the next day I marched out of the hospital was the very specific one of medical prosecutors to recommendation of medical prosthetics .
I was decided to change my relationship with the cuscer and I was to learn more about it before it was a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , use a lot of technology , open and open-information in my work .
So my great bet was , &quot; &quot; How much else do I bet is that all the data , and it &apos;s just so that that any way that you could accomplish the .
So I created a web , called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve had to improvising them , but that &apos;s the topic of this topic .
( Laughter ) Ehey this word , &quot; &quot; La House , &quot; &quot; because it was Italian , because in Italian , it means &quot; &quot; whose &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the Castic &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; can have many different numbers .
In our Western culture means it &apos;s improved or to recede the disease , but other cultures differently like for example of Ask , of the Latin American country , of the Latin American countries , can represent many other things .
And of course I was interested in the opinion of medical health and the rest of the global health professional , but it also became interesting that the proximity of the artist &apos;s leading , poet , &quot; &quot; why not , by musicians .
I &apos;m interested in social media , interesting to me the psychological scope , I &apos;m interested in the psychological scaling , I &apos;m interested in the emotional class , I &apos;m interested in the kind of emotional deficit .
And it worked .
The place &quot; &quot; La House &quot; &quot; has come around the world .
I had a lot of attention to Itha and the weird and the fourth and more 500,000 people in the conversation in a very little time through the bench , social media — most of the time , and most of them were concucked by how to heal my spouse , but many more they were about how to heal their hair .
For example , they had created by thousands of videos , images , photos and artistic representations of artistic fictions to La House .
We have here the example of Franki Finance and his action .
Or what he did the artist Patrick Lichtty : Elaboratory , a sculpture in my tumor and popped up in Thingia in Thingia .
Now you can also have my cucking !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something that &apos;s cool , you can share the same grappling .
And this was what I was thinking : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors — they were all linked to me to focus on .
So all of this information and support , I have to raise a team of a team of genetically modified doctors , traditional doctors , monsters and many hundreds of volunteers who were able to talk about the information that was very important .
We can actually get a texture of my own own own cubic texts of my own , and as a different culture .
So the current circuit of the world , the way we have and thousands of years of human history , is that it &apos;s a way that I found a lot of helpless .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Mall . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
So I could take my time to get it .
I had the doctor who wanted to work , I had to work , I had the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the thousands of people supported me without me .
All the world felt like he could be unhealthy to help me , and this was the most important part of La Casist .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m well , as you can see , too .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) So I played great news about surgery : I have — I — it &apos;s — a very big news , which is a kind of a good thing that &apos;s not creasing it .
I used to completely my life and my style of life .
It was very intense , it was very intense , had an electrodes , had an electrodes , had an electrodes of the connected of the connected brain that the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to analyze this map with the doctor to understand the risks that would take and then be some that would like to avoid .
Obviously , there &apos;s no way .
This tight was the real key to La Caso .
Millions of people shared their stories , their experience .
Kids have come to talk to people that they &apos;re used to do not have to see when it comes to the bottom .
I &apos;ve created myself myself , I &apos;m in a continuum of translation between many different languages , where science has found that emotion with emotion and inconventional research .
&#91; SOCIY LIY LMAKAOS &#93; ( La Cera ) And the key part of La House was felt part of a truly limited society and connected , and connected , whose global well-being depends on each of their individuals .
This world agenda is my forehead .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have any idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I couldn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s going on .
I didn &apos;t realize that there was something that was going to be a music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with that I &apos;m listening to the next one , and I think I &apos;m going to start with that I &apos;m listening .
( Music ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Well before nothing , we gave the life to Jamire Wildens on the battery , ( Applause ) Burma , the bottom , ( Applause ) and Chrislan Super in the piano , ( Applause ) and Chrislan Super in the night , ( Applause ) and Chrislan Super in the night , ( Applause ) and Chrislan Super in the night , ( Applause
The Korean , how we call it , is a very interesting space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that we would pay sacred is that we don &apos;t give us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
They &apos;re going on right now .
There are a lot of decisions when a Korean goes to the Korean .
We had no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
So the middle one , we did a interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; Thy Boomo . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
You all hear . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the ideas of proximity .
So the idea of a mistake : from a piece of jazz musician &apos;s perspective , it &apos;s more time to talk about the error of the person .
The way you make it make a mistake when I &apos;m in the Korean , before nothing , you don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake mistake that they &apos;re not to perceiving that is what else did .
Every &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in the jazz .
Even hard I describe what would be a fun grade .
For example , if I paina color , like you &apos;re playing with the palette , there would be dread like this ...
( Music ) If you have a piece of music — like Fa . ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Music )
You see , all of the tomato in the face of color .
If it touches Mi .
You see , all of the inside of this emotional palette that we &apos;re painting on .
But if you take me to # ( Sophon ) Most of ears have come up to the right one .
You &apos;re going to see a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this palette .
I mean , they &apos;re Christian , they &apos;re going to add that bill .
And we don &apos;t rerespond .
I saw it at a second , and then I &apos;m going to talk to you , and I &apos;ll talk to you , and I &apos;ll talk to you .
We &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s what happens when we touch it with this palette .
( Music ) Dcepture , somebody might have perpetrate like a mistake .
I would only tell you that it &apos;s a mistake if we didn &apos;t react in it .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s impossible . We &apos;re going to paint this back .
He will play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to reception it , but something like a switch .
We &apos;re acceptance acceptance , or not .
( Music ) See , touched me , his bill .
And I created a melody .
This time the texture changed in the battery .
It was a little bit more rhythmic , a little more intense in any function of my response .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you &apos;re not conscious , if every muscle is not conscious , and it doesn &apos;t recognize that it &apos;s not a conscious company , and it doesn &apos;t require to allow the business company to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t even handle creativity .
This Korean is really easy .
It &apos;s an purifiator experience .
And I know I speak for every moment I say we don &apos;t .
We know that being able to climb the Korean and to make music is a bench .
What do you have to see this with the climate change ?
We are all musicians of jazz , our stereotypes is not the most right for the world .
( Laughter ) But I just wanted to show you how we face it .
And the other dynamics is we don &apos;t make microgenomics in the jazz .
There are people who do it .
But that &apos;s true , the very artistic fictional probability .
If I said to the band that we played so , I want you to dream that , and I want to go into ...
So let &apos;s take something , let &apos;s take something .
One , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit hunter because I can &apos;t get my ideas .
I mean , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to come forward . &quot; &quot; If I want the music to go out , the best I can do is listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more to see what I can do with what I can do .
If I want to make music to a certain extent of intonmental , the first step to me is to be patient , listen to what happens and retake something from what happens next .
When you do that , motivated and inspire the other musicians and they inspire the other musicians and they &apos;re going to do it , and then it &apos;s going to be doing it .
Look , one , two , three , three , three .
( Music ) It &apos;s something totally different when I &apos;m a ticket when I was a little bit .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more mature .
It &apos;s not about spreading my vision .
It &apos;s about being accepted by the moment , acceptance each other and let &apos;s make it the creativity .
Thank you .

He wrote this to his love of love this love of love .
I &apos;m going to be sincere , so then these amazing things that are both talks and ideas that are being exposed to the intimacy in the way here &apos;s the television speaker &apos;s license .
Everybody has the television .
Seven years . Be a little bit .
This in America are the adversity .
The media is about five hours a whole year of five hours on a day .
Well , right ?
Hopteen I live in the television , so I &apos;m going to myself , it &apos;s something that &apos;s lovable .
But the many people don &apos;t like .
They were in fact , a lot of old .
It &apos;s invisible to it , and things worse , trust me .
My mother , when he was a girl , called the &quot; &quot; the tomato box . &quot; &quot; My intent is not dealorative , if there &apos;s the bad television or television , my idea today &apos;s telling you I think that television has consciousness .
If I think television has consciousness is because I think television reflects the reflecting concepts , social and emotional policies and emotional emotional and emotional and emotional framework in our spacecraft system .
That &apos;s all intrinsic to humans , and then it &apos;s going to our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good television or bad .
We talk to the popular television protocolor .
We talk about 10 programs with higher audience for a 50 years .
How do that index to make it not just that you hear , which is the idea of our social disability and collective , if not also , like those 10 programs during the age of 00s ?
How does it evolve the television over time , and what does this sound like our society ?
So by the way of evolution , from a basic biology , if you look at the basic part of the animal , if you look at the animal kingdom , the humans , there &apos;s four gut gut gut .
It &apos;s about the relationships , but the desire to powder .
As humans , what we have to remember is we evolved , we evolved with time until we were to actually evolve ourselves with the time we were to master , we evolved with these basic sentiments .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel like it , compassion .
This is not just in the animal kingdom .
The other thing is human beings , we love the entertainment .
I love to see television .
This is something that &apos;s really interesting in the animal world .
And in animals can take a play , but they don &apos;t have to look at it .
So I want to discover what you can do from this exclusive relationship of humans between the television and human consciousness .
Why did I ever evolved so ?
The little little twisted kid as the cartoons of the demos and the host of sitting in our shoulder .
Does this work like our consciousness , and try to reward and reward at the same time ?
We &apos;re going to start telling these questions , we &apos;ve done research research .
We gave 50 years back to the temple of the tucked teb in 1959 .
We did it on the bottom 20 of the audience &apos;s going to have been 20 years of the audience that there &apos;s been working in the world , and then we went on the audience of the audience , and we did it in the last 20 years of the audience that there was a lot of programs in the audience .
We talk to 3,000 people almost 3,600 — ( Music ) — and we asked them how to feel emotionally .
How do you feel to feel about each of these programs ?
Do you feel a moral ambiguity ?
Did you feel ultragested ?
What meant it to you ?
In our audience listening , I mean that this took the cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of natural needs are universal .
And second , one 80 percent of the most popular programs in the U.S. American have been talling the rest of the world .
I wish our audience are unaware of it .
I want to give him a little way to pass the first slide before I would pass : I had inspired me thinking about the idea of consciousness and the trador that consciousness can get on the day of consciousness and the trador , Jack Stern .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to give you the data from the recognized TED member Art member who you see from seeing .
Well , we go back .
So here &apos;s September from 1960 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things we &apos;re going to start the reformation of the puzzle and the state of ambiguity , which , for this study , we define the inspirational programs like television that I &apos;m going to make sure that I think better about the world .
The moral ambiguity is the programs that don &apos;t understand the distinction between good and bad .
At the beginning , you see that in 1960s , the critial enendure .
So we see television .
Hirtherness starts to distouch .
And I ust the end of 60 , the moral ambiguity increases , and the inspirational truth .
Why ?
The crisis from the Cuba &apos;s crisis crisis , the ashamed and JFK , the movement in the mid-rating agency , the racial War , the Vietnam War , the Vietnam War , the Library of Learning Learning and Bobdy Weattle , the scrambling of Watrady Learning and Bobdy Weapdy .
Look what happens .
1970 the inspirational dismorse .
The moral ampling disgust .
They put them , more Ronald Reagan , a television president , it &apos;s by the mill .
Inside to raise the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t look at the Ishil-Reba , the disaster of Challenge , Chernobyl .
The moral amendination is about the dominant eastern circle of 1990 until the next decade .
It &apos;s a look at this .
This graph is a kind of kind of kind .
But in this case , we have the happiness of it , the verge of the verge — the social command and the reverge in blue and green .
In that time in the time in television , we have &quot; &quot; Jemizing Gridger , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; Andy Grib , &quot; &quot; and national programs that reflects happiness .
They go to increase . The happiness of the whole .
The reverence starts going up .
It &apos;s been the social commage .
We get 1969 and look at what happens .
The happiness , the rereverence and the social media , not only looting in our society , but there are two programs two and three three programs in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three dollars in the next two and number three three three and three three three
What was the number one number ?
The very simple hystology is the reversible of the reverent of the reverent , &quot; Rowan , Martin Luther King . &quot;
They all invited together .
The viewers would respond in a remarkable way .
We saw this green peak in 1966 with a tendency of trends .
When you hear the term , success is success , you mean ?
I mean that in 1966 , the Sigese Boteron , the Sigese Botes , came out of singer .
This was the first program that allows the viewers to say , &quot; &quot; Oh my god , I can comment on what I think of the War from Vietnam , the president , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it means to say a fairly preceding success .
Well , the same thing that we look at is look at what happens .
1970 , the skull , the skull , the Great Gowa .
We don &apos;t see television by entertainment .
The social command and the reversed of the disreverence was left throughout the 1970s .
Now look at this .
So in the protagonizing , 70 ? Norman Lear .
We have &quot; &quot; all the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In the 500s that study , seven of the 10 programs came up , seven of the 10 programs came up during the War of Violeron 10 during the administration .
Just a generation , in a visionary years , and we found , &quot; &quot; Are we going to discover , Are we going to do that ? &quot; &quot; Mthis can do that ?
Can I feel that ?
Can we change it ?
The audience that I knew I want to tell you is that the digital people didn &apos;t have invented problems .
Archie Bunker was pushed outside his binding with the rest of us there &apos;s been corages .
This is another chart . With other variables : fantasy and imagination , that are programs like , &quot; &quot; gossip me of reality , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m feeling better . &quot; &quot; What do you do in the front of the red dot , the parapo , the back , which is a statistic thing about the job of the work .
You &apos;ll see that every time the fantasy and imagination rise , we just shine a gift from the parade .
We want to see programs about saving money and their stop ?
No . In the secular of the bionic woman , &quot; &quot; the bionic woman &quot; &quot; that would have kaplu a 10 in 1973 , followed 10 in 1973 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Shilie &quot; &quot; — another peak of the world of the entire 1980s , and the world &apos;s theory of Charlie — another peak of control and power .
What would you do in the programs ?
Camale and rich .
&quot; &quot; Dacey , &quot; &quot; the Fantasey Ice .
A much more conceable is showing our national psychic and duphed it .
Now this , my favorite chart , because these are the last visionary years .
You were either not in my stride , secure that you have heard or read about the hunter of comedy and the web of the web .
As we say we say this , the x-brand brand thing is the place .
The brand , the decade of humor , presumably like &quot; &quot; Friches &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fraid &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seinfad . &quot; &quot; All right , little stop .
But look at it : the xmark brand .
In 2001 , in September , the one-gee , the gratitude of the judge .
Why don &apos;t it ?
We had the presidential presidential of 2,000 determines by the Suprema Supreme .
The status of the technological binoculates .
The next September of September .
The railx contemplate part of the social legendity .
It &apos;s just the time that happens .
In the century of century , the advent reality , the televism .
What do people want to do in their television ?
I would think to go to the bringet or nodaly .
It gives me happiness , my world vaple .
No , they want to judge .
Power boots outside of the island .
I can do that , from Sarah Palin &apos;s daughter .
I can choose to get the new triup . They &apos;re exchanged .
Xenate , right ?
It &apos;s going to be the different way that this is the same programs , that &apos;s got to be there for 50 years — that was there for 50 years — that was what I told you at the beginning ? Minbian .
We are animals , we need our nown .
There &apos;s no longer a television decade without an imitation or dominant mother .
In the midst decade : June Colebat the relaxed program , &quot; &quot; Leddly Baver , &quot; &quot; and Lacit it &apos;s going to laugh through the autumn of social consciousness .
Finding Financies , the archaeological archetype of the IBM talked to me , I talked about abortion , the same way of abortion .
In the 1980s , it came out to the way that the way from Alexis Carrington &apos;s .
Muresey Brown vin was a vice versa when he came out the idea of being a single mother .
The mother from this was , Bree Van .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a demoo or a host of sitting in our consciousness , sitting in our television , and I know that I know is that picture of this picture .
So everybody , women and men from TEDWomen &apos;s audience , thank the audience of TEDWomen , thank you by allowing me to present my idea of television .
But also giving me the creators through the creators that are going to be placed in the morning to plague their ideas in our pants over these years .
They take their life through the television , secure , but you like a spectators , through collective social connectors , give life life , longevity or not .
So thank you so much .

In 1994 came on a Cameron in Camora , and I met a 12-year-old child who had been a torade and I found that he was going to have a child who was going to have a lawyer .
And by looking at the eyes of the eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that I had written in political was never written by a letter , because he wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy who was he was born something important for somebody .
It wasn &apos;t a politician in a politician .
It was a 12-year-old boy who had a bicycle .
What I realized I was not only was in Cambodian , but that from 113 countries in the development that I had to have , I was 93 of these countries in the developing world , 93 of these countries that were the right to a lawyer and the right to not be tortured .
And I realized I was there an incredible opportunity for all of us as a global community for us as a world community to be able to ununtie the tower of research method .
The kid think we think about torture as a form of political torture or which is reserved as just as the worst but , in fact , 95 percent of the toys today are not in political damage .
I &apos;m for people who are found in retirement systems and , by deporance , put it , put it into the tower , the torture is the most powerful way that &apos;s much more research than you have a daily system or access to the signature of the asistor is the most important thing happening .
The day of today &apos;s coastal place is possible for us to be able to do that for us as a global community , if we take that decision to come together , unirecting and end with the tower as a research method .
First comes the framework , the attribution of power and the framework of defenses the world scale .
The second is to make sure there &apos;s a temperate access and systematic to the asficit .
And the third is compromised .
So in the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we come back to the next year , and if we come back to the next year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this year , I started asking myself , and if we come back to this
Could we do something for those 93 countries ?
And I founded the International Breaks of Justice Justice that have like a specific mission to end with torture as a research method and put in practical terms of the presence of the way that research and put in practical parts in this early 93 countries , in the neighborhood .
But my early experience cartoons of Camerodian and the remembering of my first trip to the Camga , when there was a , 1994 , even fewer than 10 a.m. in the country because Khel Vermmela killed himself to everyone .
And even 20 years later , then there was only 10 a.m. in the country , and so on the air , the air , in a prison , just a few years ago , but you find it with women who are also going to say , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; And so 20 years later , I was going to say , &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a place where I wasn &apos;t in the right condition .
The first group of defenses , and I still remember , while I started , I asked myself , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for research to investigate ? &quot;
And the room was aprazy , and finally , a woman stood up , and finally , a woman stood up , and he said , &quot; &quot; Khreow &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Khreow &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Khow , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; Khow , you may not want to stop the police who &apos;s doing this , because I
And these defenses had to be able to decide whether to decide that they were going to defend and supporting them between them to put together in practical issues .
I still remember the early cases where they were the next two together , and the rest behind , and they were the rest behind , whereas the retirement ones were saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , we don &apos;t , we &apos;re doing things in the way that they &apos;re going to get done before we were done before . &quot; &quot; But one day came the perfect case .
She said he was true of the person going to run out and she had to put the young men on the heads , but the police came up , but she had nothing on it .
So then she was embarrassed . He had burned out .
And when it got his case out of a retirement , it went forward and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence for except for the second torture under torture , and so it &apos;s going to be free , and the defenators started to take case over and over and as you &apos;ll see , and as you see , there &apos;s a little bit later in the course of Cambodian &apos;s story .
But I just like there &apos;s no one .
So I was thinking : then it &apos;s just in Cameron ?
Or is it just going to be in other countries ?
But it happens in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But it &apos;s happening in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But it &apos;s happening in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But
On the Burma River I came up in a prison , there was a 12-year-old boy , but a child eight-year-old , and he had a two-dimensional cell phone .
Or a woman , paste on your baby , a beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Dad , your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But he wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl had three years .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because I was a , I had been charged from stealing two cuers and a iron of a walking to her baby and she was in prison .
And when I graduated from the British director , I said , &quot; &quot; You must let us in freedom .
A retirement , let &apos;s put it out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at me , but look at me , but look at me , and 80 percent of the two million people here are no longer been used to organize a system where could they take the cases .
And we realized that not only was the ultimate definition of the warmth , but the limbs of the warmth that marbles the distinction .
For example , in Camhhho , what happened was that he was called the first inaudible he was not alone but he had to be 24 to the Koran , and the same way in China , I always told me that &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a feoked wind in the desert when we can get together . &quot; &quot; Or Cold and , and we got together . He told me , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said ,
I mean we can &apos;t help to create a fairy , and then we can &apos;t help to help we have no resources to create a place , and then it matches , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources has never been dark for the intimacy . &quot; &quot; And with this organized action , we found that we can &apos;t help to create a fairy case .
So all the solution we found was the definition and then , the solution , the temperate the temperate .
I was just going to I have a little bit of the original one , and I decided to get back to another group of suns . What told me that they said , &quot; &quot; Mike , we don &apos;t have police on the street . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we don &apos;t have police on the street . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have police on the street . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here &apos;s the thing
What &apos;s happening then ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I want to talk about the development of development and they were forming , and it &apos;s a very strong , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very distress in the corner of the colony of defenses .
It would show me a manual to me that was really excellent .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;d like to copy it . The first one was that , the ramsy can come to the comraination .
The fission were perfectly formed .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before we all came to the office of the fiscal , I would walk back to the fiscal dog , &quot; &quot; and after a pause , I said , &quot; &quot; Toronationally . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But after a pause , he said , &quot; &quot; Toronaha . &quot; &quot; And after a pause , he said , &quot; &quot; Toronationally . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But after a pause , I
And so the key thing about the key and the key is not just the ultimate definition , but to find a way to put it in practical education , to the sense that they are being used in the system for the people who are being tortured .
And while I tell you this , it also sounds like one , like a B , of course , it seems like if you could do it , but we can do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it seems like something enormous .
And they &apos;re much like the reason I think it &apos;s possible .
The first one is that people on the ground have found that way to create miraculous , to create miracles , to make miracles , to make miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to create miracles , to
And not only it &apos;s just Innomable , who I told you about how I spoke to Cima , but also defenses all over the world that are looking diaxes .
We have a program called Juso Makers , and we realized that there were people who were expected and who wanted to help , but how could we support them ?
So it &apos;s only a competition where you can win five thousand dollars if you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to come in the fairy case .
And there are 30 Juso Makers around the world , from Sri Lanka , to Sri Lanka or the Eozoic Republic , which with five thousand dollars do things , measurement programs , and whatever you found .
And not only there &apos;s these Juss Makers , but there &apos;s also really valuable people who buy calories that are their contacts and how they can get them to them .
For example , in China , they have made laws that were unable to inferish the people who were used to be punished .
And while I was sitting there with one of our brave vanodes , I said , &quot; &quot; What can we spread ? How would we make it spinning ? How would we make it spit ? How would we make it spit ? How would we make it to make it ?
This is fantastic . And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot;
I &apos;ve talked about what we need to form and supporting the defenses .
We need polio practices in practical ways .
But the third and final point , the most important thing is we &apos;re actually comproming with this .
And usually people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well idealistic .
It &apos;s going to happen . And the reason I think that I think this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same opinion that has employed the same opinion that has employed the people who decided to finish with slavery or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who decided to get involved .
One of our favorite poems , which they share with each other , is &quot; &quot; Dad , a morpa , friends , the way it &apos;s going to be long , and there &apos;s a lot of play , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not clear , and I &apos;m safe , but it &apos;s a very safe , but it &apos;s not the whole world , but it &apos;s not just the whole world , but it &apos;s not the whole world , but it &apos;s not the whole world in the
And I always reacted , because I know the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a dish with you at some point , but I &apos;m going to talk to you about some moment of Vihho &apos;s story , which was my inspirational lesson to merel the Justice Bridges Project .
I was a four-year-old when I met my . He was a four years old , and he was a sabbine in a field provincial provincial provination in Kandal , but as a birth of the prison , they all had a lot of appreciation , even the gardens , so the only one I could get in and get out of the rexate .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s rexits , and for when Vihman started growing up , which is what it also is growing up ?
What was it was going to go out of the first rexy , and the second and then the third and then the third one , and then I was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very hard , because what he wanted to do to say was to go to the next one .
Of course I could never walk around the world to say , but I could want to visit every 156 in the world , but I would want to visit all the 156 stuck in .
Or if they were dark , it was like booming and paid his fingers through .
And the most undacant part of the claim claim was their greatest lion and its sun and the sun and the sun and the whole of the anxious , and I thought , here &apos;s Vihna . A child of catastrophe .
I am not a prison without any material , but a sense of his own heroic resonance , that in my opinion , we all fall in a place , and told me , &quot; &quot; Well , I couldn &apos;t do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I would make it so I &apos;m going to get the propeller imagination to imagine the framework of a new world with all of us together and I &apos;ll give you this journey to us .
Thank you .

Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Dying a talk in a red alernium . &quot;
&quot; Storyking a story of childhood . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No , a personal secret . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m a personal personal person . &quot; &quot; And I said ,
&quot; Reding with an inspirational director called the action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not just like you know a TED .
In fact , if you use it too much of these mechanisms , you &apos;ll seem a cliché or a emotional manipulator .
But there &apos;s one thing that all great TED Talks are have in common , and I &apos;d like to share it with you , because we &apos;re listening to several hundreds of wonderful reporting , like these .
It &apos;s been devoid with its own live-to-an early-stage little class , and I learned directly from them to the secrets of a great talk .
And even though these relational actors and their subjects seem to be completely different , they all have a common ingredient .
And it &apos;s this : The main task as a speaker is to transfer the mind of who you hear you a extraordinarily extraordinarily , a stranger and beautiful object that we call it .
Let me just explain it .
Here &apos;s Houdy .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s terrifying .
( Video ) Speach : Houly Van Dyck !
( Applause ) 1,200 people , many of the calories never come before they feel before they feel that their brains are synchronizing with the brain of Houdy and between itself .
They literally start to express the same patterns of brain cells .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they &apos;re going to sit in the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to boil a look at the brain &apos;s brain to the back of the back .
There are millions of interconnected neurons in a enlightened .
But look here , just here : a few million are connected to each other in a way that represents a simple idea .
within the face of the entire audience , I hope inside the audience &apos;s minds in the audience of the whole audience .
It &apos;s like , only in a couple of minutes , a pattern that &apos;s going to allow millions of millions of horsthanororum neurons to one of the people listening to a voice and look like a face .
But what is a idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from many forms and all of these animals , from the complex and analytical , and the very ethical and the very simple , and the very ethical .
There &apos;s a couple of examples of comrasts from the TED stage .
Sir Kobson is creativity the key of our children &apos;s future .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : What &apos;s the point that creativity is that creativity now and we have to trail it with the same status .
Chris Anderson : Elor Hardy Tusa with bamboo with beautiful blraph .
( Video ) Ernest Hardy : Medra around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s elegant , resisting and the remote controls .
CA : Chimit Adishoter &apos;s people is more than a simple identity .
Video : Shockoff Adishoter : A very simple story of stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not false , that &apos;s that they are incomplete .
CA : So your mind rehearsal ideas , and it &apos;s not just random .
They are careful connected .
We &apos;re actually formed as incredible complex structure that is your personal personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain system .
It &apos;s like navigating the world &apos;s navigation .
And it &apos;s about millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a little composer of your world &apos;s mind is the idea that the geek are like , then , the green , we &apos;ll hope it .
But if another component of your world &apos;s health is the idea that the lions are dangerous , then the green , then we &apos;ll respond in a little bit different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your life look like .
You need to be the most reliable , that &apos;s possible for the temple but wonderful world , and it &apos;s wonderful , it &apos;s a real world of it .
Now , the different visions of the world can be very different .
For example , how does it responds to your world vision when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Moohel : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman &apos;s wife , &quot; &quot; an experiment , even a sister , even a sister , even a sister , even a sister , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right , even a sister , right
Or &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; a terrorist washed &quot; &quot; a terrorist .
CA : Sexcess what it &apos;s like , there &apos;s millions of people out there that responds very different in the way .
If you communicate in the right way , it &apos;s able to change , to change , to change the way , to the way that somebody sees the world and transform its actions as much as the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that &apos;s shaped the human culture .
So if you accept that the main task as a reporter is building a sense of your audience &apos;s mind , here &apos;s four papers to address that task : First , limited to your talk to a single idea .
Things are complex things ; you need to reduce content so that you need to reduce content so that you might have to get in love with the very simple content of it , and having the chance of explaining it .
You &apos;ll have to take context , sharing examples , that real .
So you have a sense , and it &apos;s a kind of cool that it &apos;s a kind of weakness that you &apos;re going to have to tell you , so what you &apos;re talking to you is a lot of us you &apos;re trustworthy .
And secondly , it gives you to the listener to you a reason that you are doing .
Before we start building things in your audience , you have to have their permission to get it to get it .
What is the tool to do it ?
The curiosity .
You &apos;re curious about your audience .
They use intrigued questions , they &apos;re causing identifying why something has no sense , and accurate .
If you can reveal a disconnect in the world of somebody else &apos;s view , I &apos;ll feel that I will be able to cure that egg .
And when you look at that desire , it &apos;s much easier to build the idea .
Third , you build a piece of your idea , a piece of kind that your audience has to know .
It used language power to weaker together concepts that exist in the mind of who you hear it , but not in your language , in your language .
It starts where they are .
The relational report will forget that many of us and conceptions that invites them are completely warm for their audiences .
Well , the meals play a crucial thing to show you how to fit the pedestrian , because it &apos;s going to be the way that the pattern degraduates , based on a sense that you hear it .
For example , when Jennifer Kahn did this incredible new biotech called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you had a text piece of text that &apos;s going to editing DNA .
The dissemination of the dissection allows you to cut and take genetic information so easily . &quot; &quot; Well , an explaining one of this graph is like this one &apos;s going to be a great moment of clutent when it &apos;s in our mind .
It &apos;s important , so much , let &apos;s talk to friends with friends , and to see that there are some more confused .
So this is a thing that &apos;s going to show you , so it &apos;s going to be the final thing : I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to deserve to be shared .
So I mean that you &apos;re going to say that , who would benefits this idea ?
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If the idea just makes you take you and your organization , then I feel like it , you feel it , probably not worthy of it being shared .
The audience will see through you .
But if you think that idea has the potential to shine the person to somebody or change somebody or change the perspective of somebody else or inspire somebody to do things like this , then you have the essential ingredient for a good job , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
