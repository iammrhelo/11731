Today I &apos;m not talking about anything else .
I &apos;m now going to have the solar industry .
And I &apos;d like to put it in the middle of my view , and we could do it in the stratosphere .
Let &apos;s see if we can see different patterns .
This is just a little bit about what we do .
No matter .
It &apos;s a little bit of time .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re just — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s just — I &apos;m sorry — I &apos;m not going to call it .
No . ( Laughter )
( Music ) This isn &apos;t .
Okay .
The sun shines .
Oh , don &apos;t you ?
Okay . Thank you .
( Applause )
I see you .
So I want to focus on what I want to do .
A couple of weeks later , I &apos;m going to do this . I &apos;m going to tell you that if you &apos;re a little bit of control , you can make a sense that if you &apos;re a little bit of control .
We &apos;re very optimistic about the language that we &apos;re talking about , especially with others .
<unk> us : ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — you know , you &apos;re not going to be a person or something , it &apos;s a simple thing as well , or even if you don &apos;t like it , or you can do it .
TG : That &apos;s where they &apos;re going to go back to 10 .
This was the lucky policeman of the U.S. State Department .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
<unk> . We can &apos;t make ourselves .
<unk> .
You can &apos;t be invisible to the man .
As you see here , and people are doing the same things .
And it turns out that it turns out that this is what &apos;s going on , and it turns out that this is happening .
By the time we get rid of our lives , we don &apos;t think we &apos;re treating others .
So , if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if someone would tell us that if
In contrast , we &apos;re going to be able to rely on it .
What do you find ?
And I realized that I had a lot to do with a lot of mass in my MBA .
They don &apos;t know if they &apos;re a leader in the classroom , and in the classroom , in the classroom , in the middle of class , they &apos;re going to be able to live in the middle of the classroom , where they don &apos;t have a curriculum .
We &apos;re not going to be able to show two of these things .
This is what we &apos;re doing .
They &apos;re blind .
They &apos;re not known as sitting sitting in the room , and you &apos;re not going to be able to do this .
I &apos;m a couple of facts .
The first one is probably , you know .
It turns out that these hormones are connected .
So , women are more likely to be able to get more and more of this .
They don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t know , but they don &apos;t get rid of themselves .
And I &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
And it &apos;s very important to prepare for this MBA , because they &apos;re able to have their interest in their lives .
And when I realized that we didn &apos;t have the courage to get rid of the <unk> .
And the men and women who are at the end of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course , and the women are connected to this .
And I started thinking about <unk> , which is , in this way , in this kind of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , I started thinking .
If you could show these videos , if they could do these videos , they would be able to tell themselves that they could make themselves better ?
I didn &apos;t know if it was a very real real estate .
So , you know , if you were strong enough to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to create a strong change in your mind ?
Now , we know that the gesture and the trust of others is that we don &apos;t think others are thinking about ourselves .
But the question is , the question is , the question is , the question is , and the question is , you can do it .
But we also are also in this way , and we &apos;re also going to be able to do this in a way that we can do .
So this is both the opposite .
And we also don &apos;t know .
We &apos;re more likely to be able to be able to understand that much more force and more force to be able to make sense of that much more force .
We don &apos;t know what we know as we know it , but I don &apos;t know if we don &apos;t know what we know .
In terms of the sense , the sense of wonder , why am I talking ?
And the idea is , you know , it &apos;s the idea that you can &apos;t see them , and they don &apos;t see them , and they don &apos;t tell me that they don &apos;t like it .
What do we know if we don &apos;t know that ?
It &apos;s not because people don &apos;t know .
You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; like , &quot;
And we offer them , and we need to encourage them to take care of them .
I &apos;m not going to show you the game that &apos;s the game that &apos;s going to play the game .
It &apos;s about 60 percent of the population , and it &apos;s about 60 percent .
This is what we &apos;re doing .
If we &apos;re going to talk about 20 percent of the time from the moment we &apos;re going to talk about 20 percent of the time , we &apos;re going to lose 20 percent of our lives , and if we &apos;re going to have 10 percent accuracy .
We have two of these changes in both sides .
Here &apos;s what we deal with .
By 25 percent of what we &apos;re going to do is reduce the cost of 25 percent of those who are going to be able to grow up by 25 percent .
Now , in two minutes , we &apos;re going to be able to find that our brains are more ambitious , and we &apos;re going to be able to make the sense that our brains are more ambitious , or whether our brains are more ambitious .
This is <unk> <unk> , yes ?
So , we don &apos;t know how to live in our language language , and it &apos;s not just for others , but not just for others .
They &apos;re changing different from each other .
And the next question is , you know , the next question is , you know , the next question you &apos;re going to do is change dramatically .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
How do you apply that in real life ?
Of course , that &apos;s the essential truth .
It can be used to be able to make the <unk> <unk> of the social change .
Where are you ?
This is the <unk> table , which is a table .
This is a school for them .
They don &apos;t care about them , or they don &apos;t like it , or they &apos;re working .
Now , you know , I &apos;m not going to spend a lot of work on the ground , because we don &apos;t have to do it .
So what we did was we <unk> them , and we made them a huge debate , and this happened to say , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t we do that ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we &apos;ve made this idea . No , of course , we don &apos;t know ! Of course , we don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t know if you like this .
It doesn &apos;t .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying .
What do you do before you start ?
You sit down , you sit down . You sit down .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . Actually , you know , that &apos;s what you need to do , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do . You &apos;re sitting in front of your closet .
That was what we wanted .
We &apos;re going to be able to find a job that we &apos;re going to start with , and then we &apos;re going to find a lot of work in our lives , and then we &apos;re going to be able to do a lot of work .
You can &apos;t read a video in five years .
They &apos;re used to be able to use them to do their bidding , and they &apos;re used to use them to do their bidding , and they &apos;re kind of like this .
For five minutes , we &apos;re more likely to be able to tell us that we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
Nobody knows that .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; This is what we call the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the way we humans get .
To see if you can see them , you can &apos;t see them .
And then I got four of these dives four .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They had to tell who they didn &apos;t know who they were . And then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to get rid of them . &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; We want to get rid of these things . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what to do .
And we &apos;re more likely to say , &quot; &quot; What do we have to do with this ?
That &apos;s not their fault .
They depend on their <unk> .
We &apos;re not going to see the rest of their lives , for example , just like , how do you feel ?
Where are you there ?
This didn &apos;t matter .
The key thing is that this is what &apos;s happening .
People weren &apos;t alone .
So they don &apos;t get rid of themselves .
They don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t know anything .
This is the impact that we have .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t that a little bit about ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , don &apos;t you ?
So let me tell you about how long I am .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
You don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to make you feel ashamed .
We don &apos;t want to be .
I &apos;m not going to be engaged .
These words are very good at me , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little story about it , and I want to tell you a little story about me .
I was 19 years old when I was 19 years old .
They &apos;re going to go out .
It &apos;s a few times .
I had to go back to the bathroom , and I had to go back to the bathroom , and the news was , and the news was , I had to go down to the two <unk> , and that was very painful for me .
I didn &apos;t know if I was a kid , because I was a clever and <unk> kid .
For me , I wanted to get back to the <unk> .
And they said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care about the <unk> .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve got to tell you about it . I &apos;ve started to deal with it , and I &apos;m not going to tell you anything about it .
And I thought I was totally lonely .
<unk> , I wanted to be able to learn from my friends , to my friends , to make it work .
And I was finished .
I had to spend four years when I had to spend four years in my village , Susan <unk> , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know who I am . &quot; &quot; So , I decided to tell you that I don &apos;t know .
I was worried .
In the next 20 minutes , 20 kilometers from 20 seconds , I spent 20 years on the list of 20 gigatons .
It was night .
It was so sad that we were in the morning , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to call the <unk> . &quot; &quot; He told me , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t believe it and I don &apos;t know .
And yet , it was .
All of the details that you &apos;ve been hearing from .
<unk> , again , <unk> and <unk> , like this , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got to tell you , you know , you &apos;ve got it . You don &apos;t know !
I &apos;m really obsessed with . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve done it .
For five years , I &apos;ve spent a couple of weeks trying to spend my five years in high school , and I &apos;ve spent a few years talking about this , but I &apos;m not going to talk about that , but I &apos;m not going to talk about it . I think it &apos;s not my place .
And at the end of the first year , at the end of the first year , at the end of the first year , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to talk to you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to participate in the class . &quot; &quot; He was good .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is my hometown , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; This is my hometown . &quot;
That was my return .
Because two things happened .
The first was that I started to deal with it .
But then , on that feeling , and then I listened to me .
And the second one is the right place .
So , he would have been able to use it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re right here !
( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you the right thing here . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) I said , &quot; ( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what he sees . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then , after a couple of months , he came to me , and he was sitting
It was that .
So , I would like to tell you .
Follow your reality .
One of the things I had to do was pretend to be one of them .
I &apos;m not going to show you .
It can make a big deal .
Now , this is two minutes ago .
Two minutes , two minutes .
Over the next time , next time a week ago , I &apos;ve got two <unk> , trying to make it work . You don &apos;t see the cockroaches , the table , the table , or the table .
Follow you .
It &apos;s the best thing that we &apos;re going to make .
You can &apos;t see it . You can &apos;t see it .
&quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know what I was saying , I couldn &apos;t show them what I didn &apos;t know what I didn &apos;t know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know who I was , and I didn &apos;t know who I was . &quot;
And I &apos;m also obsessed with this force , and I &apos;m also thinking about it , and I want to tell you about it , because this is very important .
This isn &apos;t . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s not the news that we &apos;re talking about and people who can &apos;t do it , because the people who are going to be able to do this is not really understand what technology and how it works .
We can &apos;t do it with them , and we can do it .
Because the only thing that we can do is take care of what &apos;s going on with two of these two things .
Thank you .
( Applause )
There are many of you in the world .
It &apos;s the most important thing between them .
So , in fact , they &apos;re going to be able to live in a position where they &apos;re going to be able to live in order to live in a different way .
It turns out that in the middle of the spinal cord , we have made the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t do it with all of the benefits , honest , honest and essential for all of you , but I don &apos;t thank them for that .
Here , in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 90 percent — they are <unk> .
Most of the things I &apos;ve been able to do is make sure that we can take care of our lives .
A couple of weeks ago , I had a few minutes in the middle of a couple of weeks , and I &apos;d like to talk to you about a couple of weeks ago , and I &apos;d like to talk to you about it .
And this was the reason that this was a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to take care of it , and in fact , in fact , I &apos;m going to take care of the social and changing environment from social and beyond .
In 1990 , I &apos;ve been fascinated by the fact that I &apos;ve spent my work on my journey in 2008 .
But this time , I didn &apos;t know .
It &apos;s more of the art of art , and it &apos;s more important than art , and that &apos;s why it helps , and that &apos;s helping us to take care of it .
This is the day that they &apos;re going to take care of , and they &apos;re going to be able to take care of the social change .
Now , you know , this is the world that &apos;s always going through this world with this world .
I was invited many years in many cities in the world , and I was invited to be a lot in the world .
And I came out of the closet , and they don &apos;t just tell you that they don &apos;t live .
And in South Africa , in South Africa , in South Africa , in South Africa , in South Africa , in South Africa .
And I realized that I had more people to do this , because this was a big deal .
After that , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a robot that &apos;s used by the <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and it was a big deal with me .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Also , we &apos;ve been able to tell you that if we don &apos;t get rid of the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to tell you about the security of the security , and the security of the security , the <unk> and the <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And finally , I &apos;ve been able to tell you that this is a great big deal of science , and it &apos;s a big part of the story .
<unk> in Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro , in Rio de Janeiro .
But in fact , I &apos;ve been able to create <unk> <unk> , which is &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I created <unk> <unk> , and I created the <unk> <unk> .
So , I didn &apos;t know everyone else .
Two years in the last 20 years , 20 rupees and 200 brothers and 200 years of <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t know if we &apos;re going to play the <unk> and the people who are worthy of honor and value .
If you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to die , and you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t like it .
But now we &apos;re going to tell you that we &apos;re going to show you , and we &apos;re able to understand them , and we can &apos;t see them .
Try to see a whole thing without <unk> and <unk> .
And I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know , but there are over 20 million people around the world .
I would like to tell her , you know , when I came back to her , I didn &apos;t know if I could tell her .
Thank you , thank you .
( Applause )
I was five years old , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They didn &apos;t know how to do it , but they didn &apos;t have to go back to school , but in fact , when I was in the middle of New York , in New York , in New York , in New York , I was able to focus on a <unk> plan in New York .
They signed up by <unk> <unk> .
But in fact , in the late 1990s , I was able to tell you that the Earth was in the middle of the World War II .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> .
My father was my father .
In 1958 , Pennsylvania , the Pennsylvania , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> in the classroom , in the classroom , to see the world in class .
And then when I was at the age of age when I was at the age of <unk> .
In my father , my father , a lot of people who had a lot to know a lot from my father , who had a lot of people who had a lot .
And what I learned was that when people were lucky enough to be able to get people out of the market , then they could actually tell us that every single one of us had a long time ago .
Every single event that we can do with each other is a little bit about the fact that every single one of us is not going to take care of each other , but it &apos;s not even less likely to tell people that they don &apos;t want to do .
And a few months ago , my father told me that a couple of weeks ago , my father told me that the last couple of weeks ago , I had my father invited me to sit on London .
And then in the morning , I couldn &apos;t tell you that morning .
We didn &apos;t have to set up the firing line . We didn &apos;t know that the secret was hidden .
My father asked me to tell me about how my father and my father helped me tell me about how 30 and 30 years ago .
And the last day in the last day , the last half of the past half of the past half of the past , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
And I didn &apos;t hear it , but a few years later , after a few years later , I understood what happened .
They didn &apos;t believe that they were <unk> , and they didn &apos;t have to go .
Now , these people are going to be able to tell you that these people are going to be able to take over 700 kilos of the Earth &apos;s world , which is full of six minutes away from the surface of the Earth , and you &apos;re going to be able to figure out how many people who are going to die on the surface of the planet .
These people don &apos;t want to survive .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — people who I call <unk> .
When I was 19 , 20 years old , I had spent 20 years trying to have a place in my place , and I had a lot of interest in these conversations .
When I was traveling , I had to be able to tell you that if I could survive , I would be able to tell you that if I had to survive .
It &apos;s always a new one , as soon as I don &apos;t know , as long as I don &apos;t know .
In the middle of the classroom , in the middle of class , in the classroom , the classroom is hidden , but it turns out that it &apos;s just the best one , and that &apos;s what I did .
So , you know , you &apos;re going to have a book that you &apos;re going to sit in and read the book , and you &apos;re going to play a game in play .
So , in fact , I &apos;ve got a sense of social communication that I &apos;ve experienced as one of my parents , who , like one of my friends in my family , was the fact that life was real .
I grew up with people like people , and I grew up as a religion and a religion that I don &apos;t know .
What did it be that ?
And this kind of kind of thought that this kind of thing happened to me was one of the first five years in the year 2000 .
This is the <unk> program that <unk> the <unk> <unk> program in the National Guard .
And while I was in fact , I had to tell you that when I was in front of the middle school , and I had a lot of time in my life , I had to tell the story that I had a lot to do with my life , and I didn &apos;t have the courage to do it .
It was people who had different backgrounds , different backgrounds .
And I learned from one of them who was in the last couple of years , and I learned from one of them .
This was a couple of weeks ago , but I realized that I realized that I didn &apos;t know that I didn &apos;t know if any of any of any of them were not .
Before I was born , my friend was a friend of mine , and my father told me that I didn &apos;t know what I had to do with my friend , and I couldn &apos;t find the sense that I couldn &apos;t see me .
And then , in fact , more and more important than a matter of fact , I &apos;ve got a lot of work in the sports park in sports .
So , there was a lot of people who were different from different backgrounds , and this was an eye-opening role in the history of life .
We don &apos;t believe that there &apos;s a huge amount of faith in our lives , and we don &apos;t know all of our uncertainties in our lives .
I had to spend my job on a job that I &apos;ve been working with , and I &apos;ve got a lot of people who I &apos;ve ever seen , and by the way , I &apos;ve seen a lot of people who are at least in the middle of a couple of people , and the least people who I &apos;ve ever seen .
I &apos;m not going to talk about it . I don &apos;t have a lot to tell me that when I was a kid , I had a feeling that I would feel like I had a lot to do with my father and my father , and I had to tell me a little bit about myself .
This is what I &apos;d like to tell you about , which is to tell me about the size of the real life of the real life .
I don &apos;t know how to be in love , but I don &apos;t know what it is , but because I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in my mouth , it &apos;s very good .
And then , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show me , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be honest with my wife , &quot; &quot; and I thought that I was going to tell me that he didn &apos;t tell me that he didn &apos;t know what he was talking about , religious and sexual <unk> .
I &apos;d like to tell you that when I was in my office , I would be able to tell me that I didn &apos;t know when I was in the moment .
And when I came back , I came up with a lot of attention , and I had to tell the story about the fact that my hometown of the world was a world that I had never imagined , which was the fact that I couldn &apos;t believe that I was born .
A day when I was talking about a day , I was talking about the world in the world , and my mother told me that my mom was a word in my lifetime .
My mother said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t hate people to hate me . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t hate people hate to hate . &quot;
I realized that when I had to feel a sense of hate cancer , I understood how much I needed energy .
It &apos;s not really the reality that I &apos;m talking about .
And when we decided to start a new way , we had to start a new way of trying to make our new work in our lives .
Why don &apos;t you tell me why I &apos;m going to meet myself ?
It was very clear .
And then , you know , you know what I &apos;m saying , maybe , maybe one of the things that I &apos;ve been able to tell you about is that , perhaps , one of the things that I &apos;ve experienced is that I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s going to be the right path .
We don &apos;t have to use it as well as we can use our lives in our lives and our lives .
I can &apos;t tell you about it , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it , and they &apos;re going to be in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that this kind of kind of thing I &apos;m going to show you is that I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that this kind of thing I &apos;m going to show is that I &apos;m going to be able to tell my story .
As simple as I did , I was living in a living way , and I was living in a living way , and I couldn &apos;t have to go live the way that we had to go and go to the road .
I &apos;m not like my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
<unk> !
<unk> ?
They &apos;re not going to take a step out of it . But I wanted you to tell you , &quot; &quot; No one &apos;s going to show you . &quot; &quot; And in one of the words here , someone called the Arabic movie ?
Someone &apos;s writing ? No , no problem .
For a while ago , I was born in the restaurant in the restaurant , and I was on the couch .
And I said , &quot; You know ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; You know ?
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He answered , &quot; &quot; What do you say to him ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot; &quot; I know . &quot; &quot; I know .
He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know the French <unk> ?
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , thank you . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk to you about . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; If this is the world of the world &apos;s world , I &apos;m not going to go away . &quot;
What do you know ? &quot; &quot; What do you know ? &quot;
And in fact , in fact , the young boy said , &quot; &quot; You know , the young boy , the young boy , the young boy .
So , how could it be that ?
So I started thinking .
This is me .
This man is really <unk> !
They &apos;re not going to tell me that they don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t know .
Is it going to deal with another ?
How do we get here ?
But in fact , there are many people here who are so many people here , who have been able to tell you that they &apos;re not going to be able to deal with the most modern and cultural Talks that they &apos;ve had to deal with you .
How do I make all of our uncertainties , <unk> and <unk> ?
It could be our best brothers , who would be the best flute players .
I just learned in Arabic in Arabic .
Do you want to be someone else ?
What are you doing here ?
But despite all of that , I wanted to deal with it .
I was able to tell him that he didn &apos;t make me feel that he could tell me .
The Arabic script is the answer of this day .
It &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve created , but it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve been able to do , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve created , but it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve created , but it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re doing .
If they don &apos;t like it , they don &apos;t care about our size .
Now , how do I use it ? We all agree ?
You &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re not using the Arabic language ? &quot;
This is a <unk> .
But there &apos;s a more important reality that we are facing .
The Arabic is central .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a clue in English .
And in the midst of words , we don &apos;t want to be able to express the <unk> in the <unk> .
Where ?
The first time we started to write , when we started writing , we had to go back to school .
His whole interpretation of all of his ideas , <unk> and <unk> , which is a very specific way , is that the special sound of the particular sound of the special sound .
So when we started to write in English , we had to do it .
Even in fact , in English , in English , when you &apos;re talking about it , you can feel that if you &apos;re in English , you can &apos;t see that .
You know , you can imagine , you know , in English , you know , you know , in English , you &apos;re going to see that in English .
This is a story that doesn &apos;t speak .
Secondly , many of us are saying , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t have a <unk> , the only way it is .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
We are the Germans , the Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And so they can &apos;t get rid of their own <unk> .
They can &apos;t do it .
And so they used to be able to do a lot of money , to use language to develop language .
We know more about them ?
Well , we don &apos;t live in the world , we &apos;re not talking about the world that we &apos;re not talking about , and we &apos;ve talked about the cultural world .
Once upon a time , it &apos;s like us , but I don &apos;t believe that , but in fact , I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to take care of it , and I don &apos;t want to be able to do it with other countries .
They &apos;re used by language .
Because if you &apos;re a product that you can &apos;t do with you , and you can take a product on it and say , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s not local , it &apos;s not local .
You can &apos;t make it a local product .
They are the vendor , as early as the previous day , the vendor , as we saw earlier .
So , for innovation , they became <unk> .
And if I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , don &apos;t you know what ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what do you know ?
Have you ever wondered what ?
Who and yet .
Language doesn &apos;t just need language , but it doesn &apos;t work .
Language is our language in our language , and our language depends on our brains .
So , as we say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; you know , you know , you have a special history in private history , in private history , private history .
Language is a language , two or three or three or three years old .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , where we don &apos;t know how to do it , but what we &apos;re going to do is tell us how to do it .
What is it ?
You know , this is the human experience , or not ?
So , if I could tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , you can say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Dad , &quot; &quot; and if you say , &quot; &quot; Dad ? &quot;
What do you feel ?
If we don &apos;t solve the problem , well , I &apos;m going to be able to get rid of the <unk> and empty floor .
And this is what we &apos;re talking about , and this is what we &apos;re going to do .
I have a friend who is married to be married .
I asked him one day , how do they go ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fun . &quot; &quot; But I said , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m not going to tell you that one day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I said , &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I would say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; and then the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then all the <unk> saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell him .
He said , &quot; &quot; How much do you know that ? &quot;
Who wants to have suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Huh ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is one of a couple of tweets .
We started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t deal with it , women would tell him that women would tell her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell him that he &apos;s not going to tell her if he &apos;s going to tell her .
He said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a century for me , and I wanted to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what I want to say . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care about them . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care about them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the problem of saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care about
Help me that .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect Arabic ?
We don &apos;t know that we can &apos;t do it with the <unk> , and we don &apos;t want to preserve the Arabic language .
And so many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you worried ?
Don &apos;t forget that in this room , forget about it and for itself .
And this was what I was saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know the word &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you the answer . &quot;
We are saying , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t have it . We can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to deal with it . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to deal with that .
And if someone would tell me that I &apos;m not going to fight it , I don &apos;t hate Arabic .
We don &apos;t understand that . ( Applause ) We want to change our lives , and we can &apos;t be able to make sure that we can live in our lives .
We &apos;re going to be able to take care of our lives as we like ourselves , and we &apos;re going to be able to live .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , but what do you tell me is that you can tell me the answer . &quot;
Pretty simple , it &apos;s also creative and compelling .
After that , we started a whole bunch of other kinds of myths .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve heard from black and yellow in black and yellow . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
Why ? In fact , we don &apos;t want language .
We &apos;re not talking about our language .
If we don &apos;t use our language , we don &apos;t see our language .
We &apos;re not going to grow up .
We don &apos;t get back to the <unk> .
This is the challenge that we have to do with our modern and education .
After that , we had to go out to the village and see girls in Arabic and girls .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re going to go .
We are very , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; !
And who said , &quot; &quot; Ah , sorry ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , hey ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , no matter what I &apos;m saying . &quot; &quot; But let me tell me a little bit more about that .
I &apos;m going to go . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to see the world in the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s because we don &apos;t know .
But what we &apos;re saying is that if we don &apos;t understand that , if we don &apos;t have the problem , we don &apos;t have the problem , and if we don &apos;t want to deal with it , we don &apos;t take care of what &apos;s going on , and if we don &apos;t want to control us , we don &apos;t know if we &apos;re going to control ourselves and keep us alive .
We don &apos;t want to be .
If we &apos;re going to fly around the universe and use it to fly , and so on , we can be creative .
Each of you are a passionate story .
It &apos;s a way that creativity works in the moment .
Let &apos;s start with that moment .
You &apos;re a novel and a short film .
It makes us more global .
That would cause us to rethink the Arabic language .
I mean , &quot; &quot; No way there is no way to go . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not flat .
But we don &apos;t understand that , and it &apos;s the way that we have to be part of it , and we &apos;re not going to be part of it .
So , what do you do this day ?
Who are you ?
And I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not in English .
But in Arabic in Arabic in Arabic , you can &apos;t get involved in complexity .
( Applause ) This is <unk> ! This is not language !
You &apos;re going to go into the world with your own language .
It &apos;s not easy for the rest of a place .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there are many other things we can do .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do today .
We don &apos;t believe that this language doesn &apos;t take care of this .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you now .
For the first time , I was fascinated by the language via language .
I didn &apos;t know if I was talking to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you &apos;re saying . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said to him , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re in English . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t talk to him . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you so much . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you so much . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot;
( Applause ) Let me tell you , we &apos;re not going to be able to do this kind of thing . ( Applause )
A few years ago , a few years ago , a couple of years ago , in the U.S.
I &apos;ve learned a few things I &apos;ve learned from this 30 days .
And when it comes to us , it &apos;s always becoming more likely to be able to spread across the ground .
For a month , I &apos;ve been hearing a picture every day .
And before I began 30 days ago , before I started in my day days , before I was born days of day days before I started the first day before I was born .
Also , I also learned that , and I also learned that , and I also learned that , I also learned that , and I also learned that , and I also learned that , I also learned that , and I also learned that , and I also learned that , I also learned that , and I also learned that , and I also learned that , I also learned that , and I also learned that , and I also learned that , I also learned that , and I also learned that , and
By the way , this is what we call the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s novel .
That &apos;s great .
I don &apos;t have to tell him , &quot; I don &apos;t have to tell him . &quot;
No , if I don &apos;t know .
I learned that I &apos;ve learned a little bit about the fact that I &apos;ve been able to spend a little bit of time , and I &apos;m not going to be able to tell me that I &apos;m not going to be there .
Actually , they were very lucky .
( Applause )
The first day I began to know that the first day , and the first day I started .
He was good at having a good job , which was very high school , and I began to talk about a student full of students who were playing with my class .
This is ambitious , very high school , and a graduate student in the class , and in fact , a lot of work .
But I &apos;m not going to tell you that too much , I don &apos;t know how many times I &apos;m going to do , I feel like I &apos;m going to tell you that I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do .
But that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with this .
It was so compelling that it was so compelling that it was so compelling that I didn &apos;t even know , but I didn &apos;t know if I was in the first place , and when I started to get my first job , we would not expect to be able to predict whether or not we were going to do it .
And as I said , I didn &apos;t know what I didn &apos;t know before , but when I came out of the room , when I came out of the room , he said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , he &apos;s going to leave the room . &quot;
They didn &apos;t know who they were . They didn &apos;t know who they were .
And in fact , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s the <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
This was an epiphany .
And before I came back , I was able to tell me about the third one , and then the third thing I &apos;d like to tell you about is the third one .
&quot; He goes . &quot;
And while I was born , I couldn &apos;t read it , and even after a while , I was able to tell you , and in fact , I had an idea , and I thought , this is the kind of thing that we don &apos;t know , which is the sound of the sound of the <unk> .
I mean , for example , I didn &apos;t know what I was like , but I thought I &apos;d like to tell you that when I was in real time , I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I had never been worried about myself , but I felt like I was worried about the fact that I was worried about the past , but I realized that I couldn &apos;t believe that I was going to be afraid .
And I talked about my father and I , and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s the story .
And it turned out to be the <unk> of <unk> : normal people don &apos;t sound the sounds of sound , and my father was serious .
The sound of the audience started with a little bit of <unk> <unk> , which I couldn &apos;t tell you , I couldn &apos;t tell you , I couldn &apos;t tell you , I couldn &apos;t tell you .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I saw that I was listening to my parents &apos; bathroom , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t want to listen to the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And as I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I needed this sense , and I needed to know about the fact that I didn &apos;t need to tell him about my career .
I don &apos;t know the sound at that moment .
And in fact , when I looked at it , he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what I said , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve been looking at everything I &apos;ve been doing . &quot;
For example , when I was working with my students , I was trying to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to go back to the University of college . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I want to go .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to sit on the news news . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know .
After that , they began to go quickly on the road .
And then , in fact , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then the best one , and then one of my favorites , is a sense of shame , and it &apos;s a sense of separation .
It &apos;s not the same as I &apos;m not telling the story that I &apos;m not talking about , but it turns out that I don &apos;t know what it was like , but I didn &apos;t know .
This was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it was the number of people who were going on , and they got more and more <unk> .
You can &apos;t see the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and the sounds that you can see in the corner of the world .
For example , if I could tell you that I didn &apos;t know what I was like , I could tell my life that I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do with my life , my life , my life , and so forth , and so forth .
I didn &apos;t know how to do it , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , more than three minutes ago , and then , in fact , more than three minutes ago : &quot; &quot; <unk> ?
What would you like to avoid ?
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot;
After all , I had to tell the story that I didn &apos;t know , and I didn &apos;t know what was going on . I didn &apos;t know what I had to do with my daughters , and I didn &apos;t know what I had to do .
Two years later , after two years .
Now , I was also worried about the whole world : <unk> noises , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I had a friend of mine called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to tell me that the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and my father said to me , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be even more comfortable with that . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make it easier for me . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; You know
Now , I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you don &apos;t know , you know , if you &apos;re going to grow up , and you &apos;re going to be a failure .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to tell you , and then I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to live in the middle , and at the end of that .
I &apos;m going to lose a lot of people out of poverty , and I don &apos;t have them , and I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t want them to take care of people who have helped me .
The other way , and I &apos;m going to be able to get rid of the number of other voices , and I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to talk about it , and my mom has never been taught to him , and my mom , my mom , who was willing to tell him about it , and my mom who was ready to tell her , &quot; &quot; My mom , I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; my mom , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know
I &apos;m sorry , Eleanor ’ s <unk> .
And sometimes , if you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the truth is the fact that you get 14 years old , and I don &apos;t know how to deal with it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m 14 years old , and I don &apos;t go back to these beautiful people who don &apos;t want to thank you for this beautiful person .
But they don &apos;t have the courage to sit in the bathroom , and they &apos;re going to be able to get rid of them , and they &apos;ve become <unk> .
I &apos;d like to tell you that if we could save me to save me , I could tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , if you haven &apos;t been able to save me , I can &apos;t tell you that if you haven &apos;t been able to save me , I can &apos;t tell you that if you haven &apos;t understood anything about it , &quot; &quot; and I realized that if I had to deal with that , I had to tell you that if I had to deal with you , I would tell you
And of course , it was hard , and it was hard , and it was hard to recognize that the first story was hard to do with it , but in fact , the first big step was to do it .
For example , I &apos;ve learned to be able to tell you that if you don &apos;t like it , I &apos;ve learned to tell you that it &apos;s not true , but I &apos;ve learned to tell you about the fact that I don &apos;t know what I feel like , but I &apos;ve learned to tell you about it .
I didn &apos;t believe them .
I &apos;m not going to be able to tell them that someday I &apos;m not going to sit in the middle of the closet , but I &apos;m not going to be able to tell them that I &apos;m not going to be able to see them in real time .
I don &apos;t know if I have a lot to do with my story , because I don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to be able to spend a lot of time in our hands because we don &apos;t sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit and sit on a lot .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry .
Do you have plastic bags ? &quot; &quot; And that was my story .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you that when I &apos;m alive , I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how much I feel , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how much I feel , &quot; &quot; I thought I &apos;d like to tell you that when I realized that I could tell you how much I could do it , because I had to tell you about how much I thought I was going
I was able to tell you , if you don &apos;t know , I &apos;d like to tell you , but I was able to tell you that , but in fact , I was able to communicate with the courage to learn how to learn , but I &apos;ve started to share with my friends and talk to my parents .
All of that , I &apos;ve learned that every single one of these things that I &apos;ve experienced is that every single one of them has never been able to deal with each other , and I &apos;ve never learned that if you don &apos;t have to deal with it , I &apos;ve learned that if you don &apos;t know , I &apos;ve learned that if you don &apos;t know , I &apos;ve learned that if you don &apos;t know , I &apos;ve learned that if you don &apos;t know , I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;m not going
And I realized that I had a feeling that this could take place , and I realized that what was happening was that , in fact , what I had to do was , I realized that my grandfather had the very best and <unk> , and I realized that this would be the sound that I had to do with the most compassion and the <unk> .
After all , I was able to tell you that later , I was able to tell you that when I was born , I was able to tell you that when I was separated from the bottom of the boat , I would have been able to go back to the bottom of the box .
For the first time , 10 years later , 10 years later , I was worried about the fact that I was in the history of <unk> history , and a year after a year — I got the highest airplane .
One of my friends came to me .
In fact , I &apos;m going to be able to tell you about the fact that they don &apos;t have fun .
As I said , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I want to tell you .
So we &apos;d like to get two <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you that if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that the most important question is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure what the most important question is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you what the most important question is , &quot;
For all this time , I &apos;ve learned that all this time , I &apos;ve learned to take care of them and learn from them , and that &apos;s the sense of compassion and compassion and compassion .
I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that the most impossible moment is that a woman who doesn &apos;t want to be a woman who doesn &apos;t want to be a woman who doesn &apos;t work .
What I &apos;m going to do in the lab is that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that when I &apos;m in the lab , I &apos;m going to tell you that when I &apos;m in my lab , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
It &apos;s the honor and the understanding of the moral , and the sound of the sound , the sound of the sound of the sound , and the desire to give them a full self .
It &apos;s possible to create this kind of community , even though it &apos;s possible .
There &apos;s a tendency to say that we have a tendency to go back into social change .
It &apos;s not going to be a person in the audience .
Now , I don &apos;t have to take care of people .
For me , I &apos;m not talking about justice and justice , but we don &apos;t just talk about justice and justice , but we don &apos;t just talk about justice , but not just talking about justice and the world .
Finally , in the last 20 years , I &apos;ve spent five years in New York City , five years old , and we &apos;re going to be able to find out the possibilities of people who are going to be able to take care of the possibilities of the people who are going to be able to take care of the possibilities of people who are going to be able to take care of the possibilities .
And as I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m a believer in the spirit of the human spirit that we have to do with a human spirit . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> .
This is , in fact , in the world , in the world , to be able to share with one of the biggest challenges — to be able to share with one of you , to share with you , to share with you , to share with your hands and share with you .
We don &apos;t know if we &apos;re going to live , and we don &apos;t know if we &apos;re going to grow up , but we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
We are . We don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t want to take what &apos;s going on with us , and we don &apos;t want to take away from us .
We &apos;re not going to get rid of the <unk> .
As a woman said to me , &quot; &quot; Tell me what you &apos;re going to do with you .
You can &apos;t talk about it . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to tell the story about our lives .
But that doesn &apos;t matter ?
Because , of course , this is not a picture of the alphabet .
But yet , when I was born , I got my first job when I was 15 years old .
Now , in the early days , I &apos;ve been able to do that in the past , because the camera used to be a little bit differently because the camera used to be a kind of process .
When you &apos;re a picture , you &apos;re ready to take a picture , and you &apos;re ready for <unk> .
But for me , I didn &apos;t just want to be right in the right place .
I thought I could do it .
So what I wanted to do is to create something different , which is what happens when you &apos;re drawing images .
So , images like this : that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
But it &apos;s also a game that &apos;s unexpected .
And yet , it seems to be close to close .
Or you &apos;re seeing images like this — you &apos;re also seeing the dark and the color , but you can &apos;t even see how much it is .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Because , obviously , these are not really the images that we &apos;re not seeing , but the camera is able to prove that it &apos;s possible for images .
If you don &apos;t deal with some of them , you don &apos;t have a little bit of pictures .
So this was really a really good idea that we could do more right now .
What do he really do with his real real estate ?
Is it going to be if you or not ?
Do you know ?
What is that ?
Sometimes it &apos;s made of <unk> .
But then in the end , what we &apos;re going to deal with is how to deal with the world .
It &apos;s not really what we &apos;re saying , but it &apos;s really what we &apos;re going to tell us .
So the basic idea is quite fascinating .
And I think that I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m going to show that I &apos;m going to show a reality where I &apos;m going to show a reality that I &apos;m going to make a reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
And there are three numbers in the same way that we can imagine that three numbers are inherently relevant .
But in a certain way , it looks like the objects that exist elsewhere .
And as we know , we can &apos;t exist .
So they don &apos;t play the game , because the brain doesn &apos;t mean that the brain doesn &apos;t matter .
And I see the same process in the same process .
This is actually <unk> <unk> .
So a picture here , I think about a picture of a picture that I think we haven &apos;t talked about — things that I think haven &apos;t talked about .
And if you don &apos;t know how to do it , you really don &apos;t know how to do it , because in contrast , it &apos;s kind of wrong .
What I want to focus on is that we have three simple rules that we have to follow .
As you see here , these images don &apos;t .
But I don &apos;t want to go .
So the first rule is to be the same for the first term .
Secondly , the same must be the same for <unk> .
And in these two ways , these two are <unk> — the same size and the same <unk> .
And the third is , if you could see the pattern , you could see where one of the images came from , where someone came from .
And what we &apos;re going to do is tell you how to make it happen .
The changes between images and images are the color of the visual cortex between the images , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the only way we know that , despite the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of different images , there are hundreds of images .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) People would think that this is a story , and they can &apos;t think about it , and they can &apos;t think about it .
But in fact , this is a whole series of things that are different from each other .
And I think a way to create a place where we can create a place where we can make a place where we don &apos;t need a place in this way .
But it takes a lot of effort .
And I could be able to find a couple of months on this idea that I could actually find a couple of months to find out where I could find a different place to find out where I could find a different place .
For example , the fish are showing up to see the fish .
And they &apos;re different from each other .
The water is taken from six to six mirrors .
And yes , even in the middle of the island , I watched the island in the middle of the island of Sweden , and I painted it .
So , if you get closer , it &apos;s possible , and I think it &apos;s possible to make it possible .
Every time a marathon start , it starts .
And then , you know , we &apos;re connected to each other .
So , in this way , you &apos;re very good at all .
And if you &apos;re good , it &apos;s quite beautiful , and it &apos;s quite beautiful , and it &apos;s also quite fascinating .
So we have all of our senses , and the only thing we need to do is make sense .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Julian Anderson : Julian Anderson .
So , given that , they &apos;ve been given a data that you &apos;re not going to do in the last century , and in the last decade , all the world will have more information .
What is that ?
Julian Assange : Yes , that &apos;s possible ?
What you &apos;re going to do is take the rest of the world if you &apos;re going to see the world &apos;s world , right ?
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people do that ?
What would you like to avoid ?
JA : These are these people who don &apos;t have access to access to the data . It has different ways to tell us .
We need to take the information out of the road , trying to figure out how to fix the content , to make it easier for the rest of the world , and in Belgium , like Belgium and Belgium .
And if you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like , and if you don &apos;t know what it is like , you don &apos;t think it &apos;s like , you know , if you don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little bit more difficult , you can see — you can &apos;t get rid of the big information , and you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get rid of the vast amount of information that are going on — and you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get rid of your
CA : So , you know , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) CA : You don &apos;t know who you are .
JA : You can &apos;t see them rare . They &apos;re rare , and if you don &apos;t get them , we &apos;ll get rid of it .
( Video ) <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to tell you . &quot;
And I think I &apos;m going to tell you about this .
This is a few years ago .
Let &apos;s look at this .
It was a story .
How do you play with this story ?
JA : This is <unk> <unk> .
It was a year after that , after year after year , Kenya was <unk> .
In the year 2000 , Kenya was 18 years in Kenya , <unk> <unk> .
He was <unk> <unk> .
And when we came up with the power of <unk> , which is the power of two million squatters , they &apos;re going to be able to take over two million categories .
And when the government came together , and now the most likely man , was used as a political force in the world .
It &apos;s like a book called <unk> <unk> .
In 1990 , 28 months ago , I had to go back to 28 years ago .
This was the <unk> of the man who was watching the man who was in the middle of the <unk> , and three days later , Daniel <unk> , who was going to show the man three days after 9 / 11 .
CA : You don &apos;t have a long word to say , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t qualify for a long term in Kenya . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s going to change the way you &apos;re going .
JA : Yes . Now , before we got married , we were in the middle of the country , and then in the country , in the country , in the country , in Africa , in Africa .
It turns out to be the <unk> .
In a few days a few days in Kenya , Kenya has begun to face .
In the 20 days , we &apos;ve been able to tell the story about 20 days in Kenya and Ghana , and in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve been able to tell the story about 10 to 10 percent .
CA : So , how do you really change the information ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : So , this time , I have a video about weather pressure .
It &apos;s just a little clip . It &apos;s a short clip .
Now , in this video , there &apos;s a little <unk> in this video .
TG : ... <unk> , I don &apos;t have one .
Now , you can see it &apos;s visible .
<unk> . <unk> .
You know , the news doesn &apos;t matter . You know .
We don &apos;t know .
<unk> , <unk> !
( Laughter ) You know , ah , ah , thank you .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They needed to go .
All right , we killed eight of them .
We have two schools , and we &apos;re going to continue .
All right . They all died .
They &apos;re talking about <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> . You know what ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
CA : So how did this video effect ?
JA : This is a lot of people who are <unk> .
This is two men who are two men who are connected to this video .
This is one of our three moons .
CA : That &apos;s how many of you have ever died on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
JA : Yes . <unk> died , two children were injured .
And the guy who died , the man died .
CA : Well , this led to a wide range of these things .
So what do you say , and the main reason why ?
JA : I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t know , I think people don &apos;t want to live .
And if you don &apos;t know anything , you can &apos;t see that in the middle of people who are flying in the middle of all the people who are flying around , and they don &apos;t even know anything — and even if they don &apos;t get rid of them .
I had two examples of people who were going to be able to take care of them .
CA : And in the case of the United States , the American security entrepreneur is the Bradley of Bradley , and he &apos;s also going to tell you that if you don &apos;t know how to show you , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the U.S.
That &apos;s true ?
JA : We &apos;ve made this <unk> .
It &apos;s five days ago , after five days ago , at least five days old .
This year , I &apos;m going to show you the last anniversary of the United States of America , but they don &apos;t have them , but they don &apos;t have them .
He was in my mind .
CA : If you got the U.S. <unk> diplomatic ?
JA : You can &apos;t see them . ( CA : Yeah . ) JA : Yeah . ) JA : Yeah . ) JA : What do you know ?
The secret to the secret is this kind of thing .
CA : There &apos;s a little bit about this about this .
What are you going on ?
What are you doing right now ?
JA : Well , there is a question that , for the world , it &apos;s important for the world .
And in fact , there &apos;s so much .
It turns out that it &apos;s going to be a new kind of economic force that &apos;s going to be able to take care of the economic force that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a new and good job .
It &apos;s always going to be like this . It &apos;s about history .
CA : But you don &apos;t know a little bit about it , but when you have the fact that it &apos;s really hard for you , people have a bad idea for all of us .
JA : I &apos;m going to be able to go back to that .
So , you know , we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> .
And there are some people who have a lot of personal skills , and then they &apos;re connected to that .
And I have a tendency to do a <unk> — like , like , you know , if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to do it .
CA : You know , they &apos;re all good .
If I tell you that the son of the son of the son , he said to you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell you that if you &apos;re a person who wants to take care of you ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? This video is a video ?
The people who don &apos;t believe they &apos;re going to take care of them .
This shows a million people around the world who don &apos;t believe that they don &apos;t have human rights in this world .
My son doesn &apos;t look like this . What do you answer ? &quot; &quot; What &apos;s wrong ?
JA : That &apos;s a lot of us .
But if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t need to tell you , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t need to know that , you know , you don &apos;t need to know that people don &apos;t need to do this .
It &apos;s not because they don &apos;t have their minds . You don &apos;t see them .
Every day , we don &apos;t know that every day .
It &apos;s not going to be able to make money for this war , but that &apos;s what we can do .
CA : So , you know , you &apos;re going to have a way to make a way that the government and the government are hidden .
It &apos;s fun .
But that &apos;s the strange thing that I &apos;ve been hearing about , for example , is the secret for itself , for example .
JA : Not exactly it doesn &apos;t really work .
Or you don &apos;t have a tendency to get a <unk> .
If it is , it &apos;s hard for us , and it &apos;s hard for us , and it &apos;s hard for us to continue to take care of the people who are going to take care of us and try to continue to deal with it .
CA : I mean , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m really interested in what I like to say — what do you know ?
There are two kinds of ideas and Julian mentioned .
One is — I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to get rid of it .
We &apos;re not going to get rid of the <unk> .
Who thought ?
So what do you want ?
JA : Well , there should be a few guys .
CA : This was <unk> people , Julian .
It &apos;s a little bit more . You can &apos;t see any example .
And I think I haven &apos;t been able to do it , but I don &apos;t believe it .
Isn &apos;t that curious to deal with this recently ?
Who was that ?
JA : This is a story that we see every day .
The last year in the past year , in the past year , we &apos;ve been trained as the Gulf of Mexico , as if it &apos;s not strong .
We &apos;ve been able to take an area like this , which is actually the way we &apos;ve been able to do this , and we &apos;ve actually been able to be able to get rid of the way that we &apos;re able to take care of the benefits of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve got the courage and others here .
And it was not a <unk> , but it was a little bit challenging .
We didn &apos;t know who he was writing .
It can be a little bit more powerful than the oil that &apos;s going on .
So , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you can answer this question , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little fan .
You know , we can &apos;t see .
Okay . It &apos;s right . We can &apos;t do it right , but we can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; We want to figure out what we &apos;re going to do . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; We want to figure out if we can figure out what we can do . &quot;
What are you talking about ?
Would you like to tell you that if you &apos;re not ?
You know ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is , &quot; &quot; What are you ? &quot; &quot; And the answer is , &quot; &quot; What are the answers to you , &quot; &quot; which you can &apos;t tell you about the Internet .
You can &apos;t see that .
( Applause ) Now , you know , you know , you know .
One of the ways that we &apos;ve got to think about is one of the ways that we have a letter to write a letter from writing .
CA : What do you have to see ?
JA : Yes , it &apos;s only too much , but it &apos;s also true that we are going to be able to do it right now .
And in the past few months , we &apos;ve been able to tell the story that we &apos;ve been able to make a <unk> story for the past few months of the past few months .
This is a little problem .
So , as we are in the next new configuration that starts with new new <unk> , we don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to be able to take all of those devices , but if you have a lot of information , you don &apos;t know enough to take all of these devices and do better .
CA : I mean , you &apos;ve got to tell you that the fundamental tools that I &apos;ve got to tell you about is the Internet , or whether or not ?
JA : Yes . There are people .
Now , in order to get the data out of a little different way , we need to be able to get involved in a little different way .
CA : But why don &apos;t you tell you why ?
They &apos;re sitting on the floor , you know , 37 schools , 37 schools .
What is that data ?
JA : We had a film called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was the result of two people .
( Laughter ) CA : You know , you &apos;ve been thinking about this carpet , you know , you know .
JA : What are you doing with film ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : You know , if you &apos;re older at the age of the young age , you &apos;d be able to tell you that if you &apos;re older at the young age .
JA : No .
I was a young girl who was a young girl .
I couldn &apos;t tell you that when I was young at the age of young age , I couldn &apos;t tell you .
We need a little bit of <unk> .
It &apos;s possible to make different things .
Unfortunately , most of the things that are going to be in the middle of the United States , most of the things that are going to be in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle .
It &apos;s not like before the past century .
CA : I &apos;m sorry , you know , you &apos;re going to take care of your hands . You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do . What do you solve ?
You can give you a short information about them , or why do you want to take them and tell you about why ?
JA : And I think that &apos;s an event .
But I think it &apos;s fundamental : I think that people and the people who don &apos;t think they don &apos;t want to take care of it ; it &apos;s helping us .
My father &apos;s father , like my father , who I learned from people like my father .
CA : You don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t have the human experience ; you don &apos;t see them ?
JA : I &apos;m not a little disingenuous , but I can &apos;t see them , but in the way — but in the way — you know — you know — you know — you know — you know , you know — you know , you can see the people who don &apos;t know that .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : And in the last couple of years , I &apos;ve got to tell you about what a last couple of years ago ?
And when I got there , I had to tell you that the problem was going to be the problem of the problem , and the data would spread .
And then , you know , you can &apos;t see it .
I &apos;m not going to be good enough . And then what happened ?
JA : That &apos;s a big deal .
It was an economic recession .
It was one of the largest giants in the world .
It was about 10 times the size of France , 10 times older .
This is the data that shows last year .
And when I was five years old , I had to tell you about five years ago when I was five years old , and I had to tell you about five weeks ago , and when I got married , he started five days ago , and he said , &quot; &quot; No , there &apos;s no time . &quot;
Instead , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that if you don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to go out and talk about it .
Everybody knew that this was a little bit more likely to deal with , and we had a few minutes back , and we had a couple of institutions , and after a few years ago , we had a new law in the <unk> , which was one of the greatest states in the world , the Nobel Prize in law enforcement , the Nobel laureates , the Nobel laureates in the world .
And I &apos;m also going to be able to get rid of the rest of the rest of our lives .
And just a month ago , this law was born in secret .
CA : <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> , Julian ...
What if you &apos;re going to be able to take care of what &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do , you &apos;re going to take care of all the things that are going on , or you &apos;re going to be able to listen to what you &apos;re going to do , or you don &apos;t know , you know ?
JA : I don &apos;t know exactly why .
All we &apos;ve been talking about is <unk> , and all sorts of places , all sorts of backgrounds , all sorts of backgrounds , all sorts of backgrounds .
It &apos;s hard to see what happens .
It &apos;s a very interesting thing that we live in , and we can change everything we can change .
CA : I mean , you know what I &apos;m saying to you , Julian , thank you , Julian , thank you .
JA : Thank you . Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I am .
The story of the story and the book is my story , I want to tell you a little bit about the story that I want to talk to you about today , and I want to tell you a little bit about what I call a <unk> .
But let me tell you before , let me tell you about my personal experience .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be able to use it — I &apos;m going to be able to do it — I &apos;m not going to be able to spend a couple of minutes out of the closet — I don &apos;t know .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a little bit later on , and I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that when I am , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
It was the only kid who was one of my parents who was a single kid .
1970 , in the 1970s , in the 1960s .
Most of the people who lived in the village was a big fan of family , which was one of the families who lived in a family of family , who was in the middle of a family .
Actually , I didn &apos;t know if I had two mirrors in the world .
On one side , it was a <unk> , modern , contemporary Asian woman — mother .
On the other side , if you &apos;re religious , you &apos;re religious , religious , less optimistic .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t see the <unk> , you can see that the devil can &apos;t see the eye of the devil , the devil can see the devil .
And when I was deep , the people who were <unk> , the people who were <unk> , the people who were <unk> .
Every time I got in the middle of every time , I didn &apos;t know if I had to go to the red line , until I got the red line .
And then , you know , I &apos;m not going to sit in the middle of the closet .
A week later , a week later , they were sick .
Now , I know that there &apos;s no way that science can talk about the science and the fact that people don &apos;t know about it , but there are no people who are going to be able to live in different parts of the world , and there are no people who are going to live in different parts of the world .
And I asked me , &quot; &quot; How do you get the power ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , there are <unk> , but the power of most of the fundamental forces . &quot; &quot; And in fact , there are a lot of important lessons , which is a very important lesson in life ; if you don &apos;t know anything in life , you have a lot of important lessons , and if you don &apos;t live in life , you need to take care of it .
We &apos;re not going to get rid of the <unk> .
All of us are present in social and cultural activities .
We all know it .
We all live in a certain sense , a ring , a ring .
But what we &apos;re talking about is the risk that we have to live with the world that we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re going to be able to live on the risk that we &apos;re talking about .
We can &apos;t make the power of our bodies . We can &apos;t make the power that we can live in , and we can do it with a very long human lifespan .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the presence of life .
And as I said , women know something like this , and they &apos;re kind of like , you know , you &apos;re going to sit on the table , and you &apos;re going to sit on the floor , and you &apos;re going to sit on the floor , and you &apos;re going to sit on the door .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to tell you about : a lot of people who are going to be able to live in such a way .
It &apos;s one of the greatest challenges we &apos;re going to talk about , but it &apos;s one of the greatest challenges we have in our lives .
And this is everywhere , between the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be able to focus on the data and focus on the cost of the problem , and you can &apos;t talk about it .
It can be the main way that we &apos;re going to be able to make this kind of habit , which is the way we &apos;re going to be able to make this kind of habit .
Stories can &apos;t tell you that if you don &apos;t have a conversation , you can &apos;t get rid of your mouth .
So , in fact , we can see other worlds , even though we can &apos;t even see it .
I started writing stories from age eight .
One day when my mother told me , my mother told me that he would have a good idea .
Now , I &apos;m sorry , you know , you &apos;ve got a little bit of thinking about it .
He was good at home , and he was good at home , but it wasn &apos;t good enough .
When I was going to talk about the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> , I was a kid , and my mother was a kid , and my mother had a good idea . My mother had a good idea .
But he didn &apos;t know that when I was working with my life , I was thinking about what was happening in my life , and what I &apos;d like to do was to tell you about this .
It &apos;s not about myself , but I started writing about things that didn &apos;t happen .
That &apos;s what I started with <unk> <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know more about the fact that we could save more and more others than ever before .
( Applause ) Follow : ( Applause ) That &apos;s what I had to tell you about my life in my life .
This was another event that I had to do .
My mother was a diplomat .
And I was also at the same time , and I was in the middle of the middle school , and I was in the middle of the middle school , and I was in the middle school , and I was one of the Costa Rica Talks .
The first time I started to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a typical prison &quot; &quot; in which I had a very hard time , and I had all the kids who had all the kids who were on the couch , and I couldn &apos;t see what was going on .
So , in fact , kids don &apos;t believe that kids don &apos;t believe themselves , not themselves , but they don &apos;t believe themselves .
And in the United States , in the United States , there was a very good event in the United States , and it was a good event on behalf of a <unk> event .
You know , when you &apos;re a kid , you get sick , you &apos;re always worried .
And so , in this case , when I was in this school , when I was in this school , the military was able to have the military , the military , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the music .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been thinking about what many times I &apos;ve experienced in the late &apos; 80s .
For the first time , I saw the process of training in this school .
All the kids said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to ask you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know what I was talking about . I didn &apos;t know how many of you were laughing . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t know how many of you were laughing .
And I learned from three to three months here , and I learned that this : <unk> , smoking and <unk> .
After all , I was able to tell you , and then we &apos;d go back to the <unk> and <unk> .
And I was thinking about the fact that if I had a long time , and I would be able to find that if I had a lot of time , I would be able to think that I would have a lot of time .
Stories that give me a sense of solidarity , a sense that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell me that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell me that I was in real life .
I was 20 years old in Istanbul .
I &apos;m going to live a lot and live in a living world , and I &apos;m going to show you here .
I was sitting there in a year when I was there .
I was able to tell me that I didn &apos;t know what I saw when I looked at the building of the buildings .
And there was an old number , an old vendor , and I couldn &apos;t get married , and I couldn &apos;t get married in love with men and women .
They &apos;re going to be a long black hole in the middle , and you &apos;re not going to go along with the <unk> .
And I saw that when I ran out of <unk> , I had to tell her , I had to tell him that I had an opportunity to do with my father , and I was able to tell him that I was sitting in the middle of my school , and I was watching my father in the middle of the closet , and I didn &apos;t sleep smoking .
And when it comes to death , when it comes to death , and when it comes to death , it &apos;s just one of the things that we &apos;re going to do .
And I don &apos;t think it &apos;s always going to be a little bit like that .
We don &apos;t want to tell you that it &apos;s strong , but we don &apos;t have a good novel , but we don &apos;t have a good novel , and sometimes we don &apos;t have a good novel , and sometimes we don &apos;t know if we don &apos;t know good enough and sometimes talk about the people we don &apos;t know .
And then I went back to school , and then I went on to see the girls &apos; daughters .
It &apos;s not alone , but it &apos;s a complete change in language .
I started to write .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; You know , I can &apos;t tell you why . I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you why .
I &apos;m like , you know , I &apos;m like , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to make it better , and I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to make it better . I think it &apos;s more mathematical and more science .
I think it &apos;s a different way .
As a human being in the world of English , I &apos;ve learned that later , in English , language is language .
The language is activated when the language is activated , and it &apos;s permanent .
As soon as we get older , we want more stories , we want to make better words , we want to make better words , because our brains and our brains are huge .
This is the difference .
But if you don &apos;t get rid of it , it &apos;s going to happen to us .
This was what I learned when I was talking — I was in my village and a bust .
And at the end of the time , I was able to take all of my everyday objects out of my everyday life in my everyday life , and I had to tell you that when I was born , I had to go back to my everyday life , and then I couldn &apos;t do it .
My God has a family life for a family .
( Laughter ) But I was in the middle where I decided to make a place .
And I began to see if my wife was the case of my wife , where my wife was , and I didn &apos;t even know if I could feel so much of the Earth .
I &apos;m a part of a piece of mine , and I have a lot to live in my physical and well-being .
It &apos;s as if all of you and I don &apos;t know all the time , I &apos;m always worried about it .
And I was able to tell you that the story that I had never imagined was that much more than the story of the story .
I &apos;d like to tell you about this , I &apos;d like to tell you about this .
One of the founders I wrote was one of the founders I had written in America in America , and one of them did this .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a book . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know a little bit differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked what I said .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of accidents , American , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know what I &apos;m talking about when I &apos;m talking about college . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; You know what it means to me . &quot; &quot; But I thought , &quot; &quot; You know what to tell me
But I know it &apos;s always going to continue with it .
He wanted me to have my own personal experience .
He wanted to tell me that I was a woman who was told to be women .
And I &apos;m always going to tell you that the world &apos;s going to change the world , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and that &apos;s what we can do .
Most of them don &apos;t know , especially if they don &apos;t know that they don &apos;t know , especially if they don &apos;t .
If I could tell the Islamic world , I would argue that Islam is not a woman in the world , if not a woman is happy , if not a woman is happy .
More <unk> , sad , <unk> stories , the typical stories of the real , <unk> stories .
My name is a world of mine , which is the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
It &apos;s not like people who have a personal experience , not as creative people , but they don &apos;t have a few author , and a few author , a couple of author , a couple of journalists .
It doesn &apos;t matter if you don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s not going to be done .
In the year 2000 , I wrote him a couple of times , and I asked him to give him a question about how many times I could show him .
And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to call him a blue physicist , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t have anything that I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t have anything that I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I think that &apos;s exactly the same .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , which has no hair whatsoever .
Ten years ago , at Harvard , eight years ago , I was very good at Harvard .
And we had three months ago , a guy who was married , and I was a kid , and I was a golfer .
( Laughter ) But there was no way that they could do it , and they didn &apos;t have to go .
It was lonely .
We &apos;ve got to write the real stories that we have to write .
It &apos;s a <unk> organism .
It &apos;s not just because they &apos;re not lonely , but they &apos;re more likely to be able to make it bigger .
It &apos;s not going to be a story that &apos;s going on , and it doesn &apos;t exist .
All around the world .
For the first time , I saw that I didn &apos;t know if I had the first time in the year 2000 .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m talking about the eye , and I &apos;m going to tell you about what I &apos;m talking about .
It was a little bit of a big deal with a small <unk> problem .
There are some people who have told me about what I &apos;m talking about when I &apos;m talking about <unk> <unk> , some of them .
But I &apos;d like to point out , this is just a moment I &apos;d like to show you .
Just a story .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a story of a story &quot; &quot; just a story of a story .
It doesn &apos;t tell us how to deal with it , but it doesn &apos;t work .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t have enough political concerns , it &apos;s not the language of your everyday eye , but it &apos;s not language .
It &apos;s like this : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you all the right thing .
And it &apos;s a gift . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a gift . &quot; &quot; You can get rid of it . You can &apos;t see it .
One is the rest of us .
It &apos;s thin vertical .
One is the front .
It &apos;s the front line .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
<unk> water is water .
I had to tell you a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t have to tell stories of stories .
You don &apos;t know if you want to express that in different parts of your body , you can see them .
If you don &apos;t believe it , you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t believe it , you can see it , you know , even if you don &apos;t hear it , you don &apos;t .
Stories can &apos;t stop . It &apos;s like the Middle East , North Africa , North Africa , <unk> and <unk> .
Today , speaking to stories today .
They &apos;re listening to each other , and they &apos;re listening to each other .
We can &apos;t make us further away .
If you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s not good .
She was in the middle of nowhere , and she saved her parents , and she saved her .
But I also have a tendency to do it .
And after all of the sudden , I had a relationship with my father and a friend of mine , and then the first job was to watch the first job in the room , and the first job he had to watch in the middle of the closet to sit in the water .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell you that you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do . &quot; &quot; We know we can &apos;t solve the problem today , but we don &apos;t know if we don &apos;t think we can &apos;t solve the problem , but we &apos;re going to be able to take care of what we &apos;re talking about .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> : I &apos;m not going to live like the <unk> .
One can be fixed .
On the other hand , it &apos;s a permanent <unk> , a permanent frame .
I didn &apos;t believe that .
It &apos;s a big part of what we &apos;re going to do with a piece of wood , and the other part of the second part , and the other part is connected to the world .
This is a culture that we &apos;re going to live in , and it &apos;s also one of us , and I believe that it &apos;s everywhere .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of your mouth .
It &apos;s a place called cosmology <unk> , which is a place called Vision .
It &apos;s everywhere .
That &apos;s what I mean .
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening between our ears .
And I think we &apos;re going to be able to tell the stories that we &apos;re going to be able to live in the middle of the past , where we &apos;re going to be able to take care of what we &apos;re going to do .
And I think we have to be able to tell me that if we don &apos;t know that , I think we have to take care of our lives .
I &apos;m not going to take care of it , and I &apos;m not going to take care of it .
I love about 10 years later .
I love it .
I can tell you about a woman in one of them , and I can see a lot about women , and that &apos;s a great answer , and the other is a very happy woman .
We can see anything about everything we can do .
He said , &quot; &quot; We are our grandparents , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , our ancestors said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
And I &apos;m not going to deal with that , and I don &apos;t know why , I &apos;m not sure we &apos;re going to talk about things like this .
Perhaps it isn &apos;t good for this .
It &apos;s not based on how we know who we are , and what we know is that we know what we know .
I had to tell each other about the experience of being open and open to each other .
They &apos;re going to be able to grow up , and they &apos;re going to be different worlds .
It &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> , as soon as we go .
Our political status in our political status , they don &apos;t make all of our uncertainties .
You know , if you &apos;re on the verge of ancient ancient Athens , you &apos;re going to be saying , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you &apos;re a friend of mine , you &apos;re going to be a friend of mine ; you &apos;re going to live the world . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I was a small believer in a small number of thousands of other people , and we had a little bit of amazing thought .
This is a little <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) Here &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
<unk> .
And I started to deal with my parents .
Two years ago , I was able to tell you about two years ago .
My head was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , five rupees .
And I started to realize that when I was born .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be better .
( Applause ) This is what we &apos;re going to do with women .
The bottom was the most fundamental .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause )
And while I was in this late <unk> , I was worried about the clock on the night when I was born in the night .
I &apos;ve got to tell you , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah , I &apos;m sorry — I &apos;m sorry — I &apos;m sorry .
For five hours , there was five hours in my mind ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Most of you may have heard less .
Here , in the morning , I &apos;m going to put it on the morning and say , &quot; &quot; Have you eight ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , eight <unk> ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re eight years old , and you don &apos;t know anything . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re eight minutes old , but I don &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s good enough , political , political
We need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a chance to be able to be able to have a chance to be able to share with you .
Not a good leader , no good leader , no good leader , no good leader .
We don &apos;t have to take care of it .
I think that the Lehman Brothers , the <unk> of the Lehman Brothers , the <unk> of the <unk> , is still right .
( Applause ) You know , if you were seven hours a day in the middle of seven hours or eight hours , seven hours per mile , you could figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
And in fact , in fact , in a while , there &apos;s been the ultimate <unk> , which is useful for all the world that we live in , which is useful for all the world that we live in .
I &apos;m more optimistic , which is a lot more important for me to be able to make the work that we &apos;ve been able to do with our devices , to try to make devices better .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
This is the brain of brain disorders .
What is the problem ?
I &apos;m an astronaut in Dr. Seuss .
He said , &quot; &quot; I mean , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s a normal word , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s a normal patient .
I learned that the disease was the disease .
I was as young as a kid , as a kid .
If you can measure the brain , the brain is made by two degrees .
This is a <unk> part of the backyard .
On the right hand , in parallel , in parallel .
It was made by two mirrors .
Now , thinking about something different about different things , and it &apos;s even even more important for them .
Now forgive me . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
The right brain is the way we think about the way our right brain works .
Now , at the same time , in the same time , all of the things we &apos;ve been able to do is to tell you about how much the moment we &apos;ve been able to change all the time — how do you feel , how do you feel , and how they feel , and how they feel .
So , we &apos;re a little bit obsessed with energy with the power of our right brain .
That &apos;s the moment we are , right , right , right .
But the left brain is a whole place in a whole place .
The first one is thinking about my left .
On the left side of the screen , you can take the information out of the screen .
And the left brain is thinking about a language .
We &apos;re going to live our lives on our planet .
This is the sound of the voice : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go home .
When we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to talk about .
To me , I was obsessed with myself , and I started teaching .
It &apos;s just a little bit of fun — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , I feel like I &apos;m moving .
And I decided to take a shower .
<unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t see the atom and the atomic nucleus .
The only thing that I &apos;ve done is the fact that there is energy — it &apos;s power .
Have you ever wondered what ?
All right , and all the rest , and all of us .
( Applause ) Thank you .
You can &apos;t tell you that you &apos;re in front of you .
It felt like I was .
And then my left brain will go back and forth .
And that &apos;s right now .
And then , &quot; &quot; Oh ! ! !
( Laughter ) And then I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t . &quot;
We need to take care of it , make it work . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know .
Let &apos;s try it .
And I was able to go back to see what was going on .
So one of the things that I &apos;ve been trained in is that one of the reasons why the phones can come from the phone will increase the number of numbers .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like the Golden Age . &quot;
What if my life changed my life .
And if my brain is connected to each other .
So , how are you going to be a big fan , you know ?
Or , just like , if we &apos;re lonely , we can &apos;t live .
You can &apos;t get rid of your right .
