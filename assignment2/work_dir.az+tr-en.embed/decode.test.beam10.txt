Today I &apos;m going to tell you an unexpected story .
I now have the solar system industry .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be able to do with our little progress , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
( Applause ) Now , let &apos;s look at this differently .
This is a little bit about what we &apos;ve done .
No .
It &apos;s a little bit wrong .
( Laughter ) We just — I &apos;m not — this is a <unk> — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — this is just — ( Laughter ) .
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music )
Okay . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s the sun .
Oh , if you don &apos;t know ?
Okay . Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want to focus on what I &apos;m talking about .
And then a few years later , I &apos;m going to tell you that if you &apos;re a little bit more likely to be able to do it , then you can make it very important that if you &apos;re a little bit more likely to use it .
We &apos;re very careful in the language of the language , especially the language of others .
Most of the different aspects of the world : ( Laughter ) I think it &apos;s a lot as simple as you can see , and if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s a simple thing as simple as possible .
TG : That &apos;s where they go back to 10 years .
This was the lucky officer in the United States of America .
( Laughter ) But the answer is — no . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We can &apos;t see ourselves . We can &apos;t trust ourselves .
<unk> .
You &apos;re not going to be invisible for the man .
As you see , there are other things , and people have the same things .
It turns out that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to get rid of it .
By the time , when I walked through my eyes , we often don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be afraid .
I mean , if someone comes to telling us if someone is going to make the power of power , you can &apos;t believe it .
And in contrast , we need to get rid of it .
Have you ever wondered what ?
And I found that when I was an MBA in the MBA , with a lot of atomic power .
You know , if you &apos;re a leader who can &apos;t cooperate , in class , in class , we &apos;re not going to go into the middle of the supermarket , where they &apos;re still in the middle of the supermarket .
It &apos;s almost almost like two of these things .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re totally invisible .
They &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
It &apos;s a few things for myself .
The first is to remind you of that .
And it turns out that it depends on that .
So when women are older than they are older , they become more like this .
They feel more vulnerable than women , and they don &apos;t care about it .
It &apos;s also out of the <unk> .
And this is very important because it &apos;s very important because they don &apos;t care about them .
It was always the fight for us to find out that we were always fighting .
It turns out that the people and the women are at the end of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course .
And I started to think that I was able to think about my journey , which is that we could get rid of it in this way .
And if these videos were going to be able to take these videos , if they could do this kind of thing , they could do that if they could make them better ?
It wasn &apos;t going to be the fact that there was a lot of <unk> .
So , if you &apos;re going to make sure that you &apos;re going to make it powerful , you can make it feel stronger if you could make it feel stronger ?
Now , we know that it &apos;s kind of about the sense of perception , and we need a lot of ways to do it .
But the question is , the question of the question is , what do you do with this sense of sensing and recognition .
But we also need to be able to get rid of our lives in this way , and we also need to get rid of it .
So this is all two different times .
They &apos;re also also changing .
We need to think about ourselves as powerful , and we need to think that we need more power to deal with more and more powerful than that .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of our lives .
It &apos;s the sense of perception , the way I think about complexity , what do I &apos;m talking about ?
And the idea of the idea is that I don &apos;t know how to get them , but I don &apos;t understand them , and I &apos;m not going to tell you that .
What &apos;s going on is what &apos;s going on with the <unk> ?
It doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s powerful people .
They &apos;re going to tell them , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot;
And we offer them an opportunity to take care of them .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know the game of <unk> .
And it &apos;s only 60 percent of them , and 60 percent of them are incredibly important .
And that &apos;s what we can do .
I &apos;m going to ask for the moment that we &apos;ve got 20 percent of our kids , 20 percent of the world &apos;s population of 20 percent of the world &apos;s worth of 20 percent .
The two brothers are able to make these changes .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;ve got .
We &apos;re going to spend 25 percent of our lives on the market , and we &apos;re not going to be able to measure the size of 15 percent of our lives .
For two minutes , I think that our brains are more ambitious , and we need to feel more ambitious , and more comfortable , and we need to feel more ambitious .
This is <unk> <unk> , right ?
So , if we don &apos;t know about our language , we don &apos;t think about how we think about our language .
You need to change other than that .
The next question is that the next question you can see is that you can change the amount of energy that you can see when you don &apos;t have a few extra dimensions .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
How do you apply that in real life ?
Of course , that &apos;s the essence of us .
It can be used to be used to use these ideas that can be used in social ways .
Where are you going to see ?
Now , this is a picture of the <unk> desk .
For some of them , that &apos;s schools .
They don &apos;t take care of them , or they don &apos;t work in this way .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t have a job when you don &apos;t have a job , because you don &apos;t believe it .
So we &apos;ve been able to reconstruct the <unk> , <unk> them , and that &apos;s what happened : &quot; How do we do that ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Now , I don &apos;t believe this idea . No shit ! No . No .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
It &apos;s not about you .
That &apos;s what we want to do .
What do you do when you get older ?
You sit on it . You &apos;re not going to fight it .
If you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to get rid of it , you know , that &apos;s what you need to do . You know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do . You &apos;re going to sit on the couch . You &apos;re going to sit at the table .
This was what we wanted .
And then I was able to go back to see a lot of work , and then I &apos;m not going to get a lot of work on a lot of work , and then I &apos;m not going to have a lot of work in a lot of work .
You have a video video on five minutes .
They don &apos;t want to use them to be able to do what they could do , to make sure that they could be able to use them to do what they could do .
For five minutes , we &apos;re more likely to get rid of the eye to look at it .
Nobody knows that .
We call this &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; This is what happens when you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to get rid of it .
You can &apos;t get them to see if you want to see them .
And then we &apos;re going to get rid of the four and four .
They were <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They had <unk> what they were doing , and then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to have this work , &quot; &quot; and then we want to get rid of these things .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to take it up .
And I &apos;m going to get rid of it . &quot; &quot; What do you do with this ?
That &apos;s not what they can &apos;t see .
It depends on their <unk> .
Let &apos;s look at the other side of our generation . For example , what do you get from ?
Have you ever woken up ?
This was no matter whatsoever .
The key thing is that this was not what was happening .
People were alone in real time .
That means we can &apos;t preserve themselves .
They &apos;re never going to be able to do it .
It makes the difference that it &apos;s happening .
And when I ask people , you know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t believe it , you can change our lives , you can change our lives , and say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not a little ?
And I &apos;m going to tell you that as much as I can get older .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
You don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know anything .
You can &apos;t get it .
They don &apos;t want to be anywhere .
I &apos;m very good fliers . I &apos;m going to tell you a little story about it , and I want to tell you a little story about it .
At 19 , I was 19 years old , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> go out .
It &apos;s a few years old .
And I had to go on my shoulder , and I had to go on the couch , and I had to go on my couch , and the news was that I was going down in the morning , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go down . &quot; &quot; That was very painful for me .
I didn &apos;t know what I was talking about , because I was a smart boy who was smart and successful .
For me , I wanted to go back to school .
They said to me : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but you don &apos;t believe it , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to fight it . I &apos;m going to fight it up , and I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to have . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t tell me , you don &apos;t know anything about it .
I felt a lot in my life .
And I didn &apos;t believe that , in my mind , I was obsessed with my own life , and I couldn &apos;t care .
I ended up in the middle .
I had to spend four years on my journey , and I had to spend a lot of time with the Susan <unk> , and I was obsessed with the Susan <unk> , and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
I was <unk> .
When I was 20 years old , I was 20 years old , 20 years old .
It was night .
In the morning , I was so glad that I was in the morning . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do .
We need to know that if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t see it .
And if you don &apos;t know .
You can &apos;t hear all of the <unk> you are .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t like , you know , if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;re not going to tell you that it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s been taken off . You don &apos;t believe that .
I mean , I don &apos;t really know , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I did .
You &apos;ve got to spend five years in high school for five years , and a couple of years ago , I <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I think it &apos;s not my place .
At the end of the first year , at the end of the day , I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go to college . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to live on the beach , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to live . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s good for me .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is not my place . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; This is not my place . &quot;
This became my daughter for me .
Because two things happened .
The first one was to deal with that feeling .
But he woke up , and he said to me .
And second , it became clear that he had the right place .
So , he could make a <unk> .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to get it here !
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , you &apos;re going to tell you , you &apos;re going to tell you that I &apos;m very good at all , &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go in class . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go in class . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And a few months later , he came up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen it . &quot; &quot; (
He was hungry .
So I &apos;d like to tell you , I would like to tell you , &quot; I want to tell you , thank you .
Follow the matter .
I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that as much as possible as one of the <unk> .
I can &apos;t believe it .
You can see that there &apos;s a huge amount of <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
The next time you &apos;ve got time on a journey , you &apos;re two <unk> , you &apos;re going to try to do this . You &apos;re not going to get the cockroaches , you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to die .
Go ahead .
It &apos;s the best way to get rid of it .
You &apos;re not going to get rid of it . You don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , I didn &apos;t show them what I &apos;m going to tell them , &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t show them what I &apos;m talking about .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know who I am . I &apos;m going to show them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to show them . &quot;
I &apos;d like to put it in my hands on this force , and I &apos;m also going to tell you about it , because it &apos;s very <unk> .
This isn &apos;t the <unk> . ( Laughter ) This is the <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to ask people to deal with people , because people who are interested in this technology , and they don &apos;t have the power , no matter what they are and not .
We can &apos;t do it with them , we can &apos;t use it .
Because it &apos;s because of the <unk> , the amount of attention I could do with two hours of attention would be very important .
Thank you .
( Applause )
There are so many ways in the world .
It &apos;s the closest you can see between them .
It &apos;s kind of like , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to put it in a way that you can &apos;t feel like they &apos;re going to get to live .
They came up with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to be able to make sure that they could benefit from all the transactions , and they don &apos;t want to tell them that they can do it .
Here , in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 90 percent — they &apos;re <unk> .
Most of them work on their bodies . They &apos;re going to be able to get rid of our lives .
I &apos;m not going to tell you about a few years ago when I was a few years old , and I &apos;m not going to wake up , and I &apos;m not going to wake up and talk about it .
And this is the reason why this is the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do , and I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that social , social and environmental change that I don &apos;t know .
In 1998 , I translated my attention to my job when I didn &apos;t know my job when I was born in 1958 .
But this time you can get rid of it .
And when I was in art , I was able to get a lot more attention to the art , and that was a lot of attention , and they helped them grow the amount of attention .
This is the day , and they &apos;re not going to be able to make social progress .
We need to know that this world was always happening in this world since this world .
In many cities , I was invited by many cities in the world , and I was invited to join a lot in the world .
And I came back to my office , and they don &apos;t just live in their lives .
I &apos;m not going to find them , I think , in Africa , South Africa , South Africa , in Africa , in South Africa .
And I realized that there was a lot of people who were more people , because it was great .
And then after that , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the purpose of the community , and the purpose of the community , and the purpose of the community .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It was also <unk> by <unk> <unk> , which is also the security of the security , the security of the security , the security of the security , the <unk> , the <unk> to see .
Now , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the other thing : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And finally , this is a great deal of big , big , big , big , big , big <unk> .
This is the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in Rio de Janeiro and <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;ve created the <unk> of TEDx , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So we don &apos;t care about everyone .
About two years ago , 2,000 volunteers , 800 volunteers , 200 volunteers , and 200 <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
No matter what I &apos;m talking about is an honor and chance of honor people who are being trained .
You can &apos;t see that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to die , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of your mind , you know , you don &apos;t know .
Now , now you &apos;re going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to look at each other , and you &apos;re not going to see them , and you can &apos;t see them .
Try to see a whole thing without <unk> and <unk> .
If you don &apos;t believe it , there are over 20 million people around the world .
You can &apos;t see someone who &apos;s going on to see someone who &apos;s going to get one of them .
<unk> , thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
I was five years old , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> <unk> , but I &apos;d like to spend a few hours in the middle of San Francisco , where I was in the middle of San Francisco , in New York , in New York City : <unk> and <unk> plans .
<unk> plans by <unk> plans by <unk> plans .
But it turns out that , in fact , in the 19th century , the World Cup <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to get rid of it .
I &apos;m not going to tell you .
In 2009 , Pennsylvania , when I was born in Pennsylvania , I was able to look at the world , and I was able to look at the world in class , and I didn &apos;t believe that I was going to be able to see the world in class .
And after the age of <unk> , after the age of <unk> .
My father took me to see what a lot of people had seen a lot of people who had seen a lot of people .
And I &apos;ve learned about these things that I &apos;ve learned about to find out : people who are so far away from each of each of us is the same time when each of us should be able to understand it &apos;s the same as if each of each of us should .
With each other , every single nation , every single nation , every single nation , is able to tell people that we can tell each other , and we need to tell people that they will be less likely to be able to take care of each other .
And a few months ago , my father came to me with my father who was a couple of weeks ago with my father in London , which was a couple of weeks ago when I was in London .
But in the morning , I &apos;m not going to meet him .
We didn &apos;t even know that if we don &apos;t know , we didn &apos;t know that it was hidden .
My father would help me to join me with my father , and my father would help me to tell me about how I got 30 years old .
Now , this is the end of the night sky with a little orange dot on the last night , when it came to the end of the last week , and I didn &apos;t believe it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Now , if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s all fun , but in a few years after a few years later , I realized that I could actually find that .
They don &apos;t believe that when they &apos;re <unk> , they don &apos;t believe that they are .
These are people who have taken 700 pounds of light out of the world , and that &apos;s where you can see that the Earth can &apos;t get 700 pounds out of the world , and that &apos;s how many people don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to be able to deal with the world , so that they don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to be able to make sure that they don &apos;t know .
And these people don &apos;t want to find myself .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the people I call <unk> .
When I was 19 years old , when I was 19 years old , I had to tell my friends that my friends had become less likely to be able to find out in these days .
I would feel like I would feel like I would feel like I would feel like I would feel like I &apos;d ever imagined .
As a new one , it &apos;s always a new one of the kids that they &apos;re talking about .
In fact , in the middle of the stadium , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , there was no secret , but it was clear that it was the best part of the world , and it was that he couldn &apos;t believe it .
And so I wrote a whole bunch of people , read a book , read a book and play a game .
And so I had the ability to communicate that social communication that we have in social media like one of my friends , in my family , in my family , my life .
I grew up in a way that people can &apos;t understand , and I can &apos;t even understand it as religion as religion .
What has happened to you ?
This kind of thing came up to me when I thought about this kind of idea that I had to think about this kind of thing , a year 2000 .
We &apos;ve got a set of opportunities to take a <unk> program to try to participate in the National Geographic program .
As I was in the middle of my class , I was in the middle of my country , and I had a lot of other people who were sitting in my life , and I had a lot of other people who were trying to find a lot of work , like someone else who was sitting there .
It was the people who lived in a variety of different ways .
I learned that one of the stories I met was a friend of one of my daughters <unk> .
And I realized that I was a few years old , and I realized that we weren &apos;t going to be able to be able to live between each other .
And before I was a friend of mine , my brother , my friend of mine , and my mother , I had to tell you that I had a sense that I could not tell you that I couldn &apos;t believe it .
But if I had a more important return , I could find that I could find a lot of fun in the playground for some of the things I could find .
Here I was in a variety of different ways , and this is the kind of experience that people have experienced in the world , and this experience played the basic role of experience .
It was the fact that there was a huge amount of information that we could find , and that was the fact that we need to get rid of the whole world .
I &apos;ve got a job that I &apos;ve been trying to spend in the middle of the class , and I &apos;ve got a lot of people who I &apos;ve seen , by the way , when I &apos;m a graduate student , and I &apos;ve never seen a lot of people who I &apos;ve seen .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that when I was a teenager , I thought I was a little bit more like a person who was sitting in my closet , and I had to tell me that I was a little bit more like a friend of mine , and I decided to tell you a story about myself .
This is what I &apos;m going to tell you about , that I &apos;m going to tell you about the real life of real life with the real life of real life .
We don &apos;t know how to take care of it , but it &apos;s very good for what we &apos;ve been able to do with it , but it &apos;s very good for the reason why we don &apos;t have it .
And then then , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> Show me . &quot; &quot; And I had to tell you that I was going to be honest about it , religious , religious beliefs , religious beliefs , religious beliefs , religious and sexual beliefs .
I &apos;m a believer in some of the moments that I &apos;ve heard about , in the moments that I &apos;ve heard about , you know , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
I &apos;ve been fascinated by a lot of time when I was inspired , and the fact that I was a believer in the spirit of my hometown , which was the fact that I &apos;ve never been able to tell my story about the fact that I &apos;ve never been able to understand the world more than ever before .
On one day , I had to talk about the world around the world , and my mother had a conversation about my life , and my mother would talk to me about my lifetime .
And so my mother said to me , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t hate people to hate it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; You don &apos;t hate people to hate them . &quot;
And I realized that when I had a sense of hatred that I hate to hate when I had a sense of hatred .
This is not the real step in my life .
And when we decided to go back to school , we didn &apos;t know that when we decided to start to start a new house .
Why don &apos;t I put it in it ?
They &apos;re very <unk> .
This is what I &apos;m saying to you , maybe , maybe someone else , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about , and I &apos;ve never been able to find that much better than anyone else .
We need to be able to preserve our lives as a result of our lives and our fears of our lives .
I don &apos;t know if they were able to do that , and they don &apos;t care about the fact that they don &apos;t know that they are suffering from the grave and their dignity .
I &apos;m going to go ahead and see if I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d like to do with you , I &apos;m going to go back to my shoulder .
As simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as I am , and the way that we don &apos;t have to go on the road , we don &apos;t have to go on the road .
I &apos;m not like my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s a lot of crap !
<unk> ?
They don &apos;t know that they were on a line , but I wanted you to do it .
Boy : Who did it ? Anybody ? No problem .
For a while ago , I was in the restaurant , and I was on the floor of cooking .
I said , &quot; &quot; Do you have your hair ? &quot;
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , let me tell you that it &apos;s funny to me .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you call it ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! No ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; ( JAWS said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to wake up ?
He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing with it ! &quot;
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to ask you to do it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; If this is the best girl in the world , I &apos;m not going to leave the floor ! &quot;
What do you mean , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; what do you have ?
And so I said , &quot; &quot; The young boy , &quot; &quot; the young boy , the young boy , who said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So what would you do with that ?
Now , I started thinking .
This is me .
This man was really <unk> !
They &apos;re not going to tell me that they &apos;re not going to take care of their own selves .
How do you respond to another ?
How do we get here ?
But there &apos;s a lot of people here , there &apos;s a lot of people here , and they &apos;re not going to be able to make sure that they &apos;re not going to be able to deal with them , but they &apos;re not going to be able to do anything that they can do .
I &apos;m all <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ?
It could have been the best flute players in our lives .
All of the things I learned from English in Arabic .
Do you want to be one of them ?
Where are you here ?
Despite all of that , I wanted to deal with it .
I didn &apos;t want it to be able to do it .
Arabic doesn &apos;t respond to this day .
It &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re not talking about the language that we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re not talking about the way that we &apos;re going to work in the world , but it &apos;s not the language we &apos;re using .
If you don &apos;t know , they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
So what I &apos;ve been able to use ? &quot; &quot; What do we all do ?
You know , we need to use Arabic language .
This is a <unk> .
But there is another one more important reality that we have .
Arabic is a central language .
It &apos;s called <unk> , which is a perfect word in the English language .
We need to get rid of other words in English to do other ways .
How ?
It was the first time when I was writing the first time when I was writing .
His whole idea is that all of the ideas that are special , and the private voice , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
So when I started to write an English word , he had to be enough .
In fact , in English , in English , in English , you can tell you that you can feel that you feel like that .
You can imagine , you know , in English , you know , you &apos;re in English , which is in English .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
Secondly , it &apos;s often called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the only way that you can &apos;t read the word , the only way that you can &apos;t get it .
This is a <unk> that I &apos;ve developed .
The Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And so they don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to make it .
They can &apos;t do that .
So they used to use a lot of money to develop their language , to develop language .
We know more about them ?
Well , we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not sure that we &apos;re not going to grow up in the world , and we &apos;re not going to tell us that our ideas are not going to come from us .
It &apos;s a time when we &apos;re thinking about it , but we &apos;re not going to be able to make sure that we &apos;re not going to be able to do that , but if we don &apos;t want to do that , we don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be able to live in different ways , so we don &apos;t understand it .
They don &apos;t want language to do .
Because if you don &apos;t know , if you &apos;re a product or a other side , it &apos;s a product of a product , and it means that it &apos;s not domestic , but it &apos;s not native .
You need it to be a local product .
They are <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;ve been talking about before , as we &apos;re talking about before .
So they became the <unk> for innovation , for innovation .
If I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Have you ever heard what , flat ?
Who , and why .
Language isn &apos;t just the way that language is not just for a conversation .
Language is specific to our senses , and our brains are connected to our brains .
So , we say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; a private history of every one of you can have a private history in private history .
Language is not either two or three or three or three options .
He was like , what we can do with our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears of how we feel .
What &apos;s going on ?
How can you deal with this human , or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying , &quot; Dad , you know ? &quot;
What do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t solve the problem , it &apos;s good , and it &apos;s not going to be empty .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you , which is a special thing that makes us special .
I have a friend of friends who are married married .
And when I asked him , how do we do things ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , everything is good . &quot; &quot; But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not good enough . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The women , the women , said to him , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then all the <unk> said to him .
And he said , &quot; &quot; How do you have a human ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; How can you possibly have this ? &quot;
Who wants suicide ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> me ? &quot; &quot; ) This is one of our adventures .
So we started thinking about it , because I didn &apos;t deal with the fact that women would tell him that she would tell him that she would tell him that she would tell him that I could tell him that I could tell her .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , he said to me , &quot; &quot; He said to me , &quot; &quot; He said to me , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that when I die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell them the word for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what it &apos;s like : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell
Help me do this .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We don &apos;t know that if we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to be able to preserve it , and we need to preserve the Arabic language .
And so many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why do you worry ?
This is <unk> and <unk> . &quot; &quot; There is no problem !
This is what I &apos;d like to say in the Arabic language , &quot; I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to tell you that if you don &apos;t believe that .
We need to say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to do it . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to deal with that .
And if someone came to me , I hate Arabic , I hate Arabic .
We don &apos;t believe , ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — we want to change our lives , and we need to change our lives and our everyday lives .
We &apos;re going to be able to get rid of our lives as we are , and we need to live our lives .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about , but you &apos;re not going to ask me the answer to me . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a golfer .
Very simple , very simple , creative .
And after that , we started to have another <unk> article written by that .
You &apos;ve heard that you &apos;re going to put it on the beach , and you &apos;re going to put it on a beach with black and yellow . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to wake up .
Why ? You really don &apos;t know .
We don &apos;t rely on language .
If we don &apos;t rely on language , we don &apos;t believe that we can &apos;t .
We don &apos;t believe that we are <unk> .
We &apos;re not going to get recycled .
It &apos;s also serious about our modern and cultural heritage .
After that , we &apos;re not going to call &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not going to tell you about the girls &apos; 60s .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; for girls and boys .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; !
And who tells you , &quot; &quot; Ooh , you don &apos;t call the English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No , no . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know how much it is . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe how much denial can happen . &quot; &quot; But let me tell you a little bit more beautifully .
I said , &quot; &quot; The Internet , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go through the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because this is what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s what we can do .
But we don &apos;t believe that if we don &apos;t think matter , we can &apos;t solve it , and if we don &apos;t matter , we don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
You can &apos;t get it .
If we can fly into the universe , or the bottom line , we can be creative and creative .
You know , every one of you is a passionate person .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about the essence of you .
Let &apos;s start .
Let &apos;s make a book and a short film .
It &apos;s going to make us global again .
It can make a difference that we can reconnect with Arabic .
It &apos;s not flat . It &apos;s not flat . It &apos;s not flat .
But we don &apos;t believe that there are things , and we need to be a part of the way that we can make a part of that path .
What can you do this day ?
<unk> , who are you ?
And if I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m saying to you , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , Richard , <unk> or Chinese .
But in Arabic , in Arabic , you can &apos;t find a mess with a mess .
( Applause ) This is <unk> ! That &apos;s not language !
You end up with a language with your language .
Not easy to get back to a place like this .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there are some other things we can do .
We &apos;re not going to make it here today .
We don &apos;t believe that this language should be able to take care of their attention .
Now let me tell you a little bit .
The first time I ran through the language , the first time I ran through language .
I didn &apos;t believe that I was saying , &quot; &quot; This is what you &apos;re talking about , you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to call it &quot; &quot; in English . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you very much . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot;
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you , you &apos;re not going to have this cultural heritage . ( Applause )
And so a few years ago , a couple of years ago , the president of the United States , the president of the U.S.
I &apos;ve learned a few things , I &apos;ve learned a few things .
And instead of going on and on and so on , it was always the same thing as much as possible .
For example , I was a picture every day .
And before I started our 30 days , I started before .
I also learned that , well , I also learned that , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned
By the way , this is the way , by the way , if you don &apos;t want to do the words of your daily life .
It &apos;s a novel .
He &apos;s very <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to worry . &quot;
No , I can tell you , if you don &apos;t . &quot;
I learned that I &apos;ve learned that little , innovative , and I &apos;ve never been able to do anything that I &apos;ve never could ever do .
Actually , they were very lucky .
( Applause )
And the first day I started to find my journey full of hope and hope .
He was very good fliers , he was high school , he was high school , and I began to learn from my class full of students , and I went on and forth .
This is a kind of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and it was a very compelling image .
And in fact , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I think I &apos;m very sorry , I &apos;m not going to tell you that the men , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
But that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you .
It was so compelling that it was so compelling that I didn &apos;t even know how much it was , so I couldn &apos;t guess what I was going to do .
As I started talking , I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m not talking about what I &apos;ve been talking about before , when I left the room , when I left the room , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what happens . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what happens . &quot;
They didn &apos;t know who they were . They didn &apos;t know what they were .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to look at it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re not going to meet your son . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
This was a discovery .
And before I got older , then I was able to tell you all the things that I &apos;d like to do with my third question , my third question .
&quot; He goes . &quot;
And I had a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I was also thinking about it , and so I decided to make sure that this is the kind of ties that we &apos;ve experienced in the <unk> of time .
For instance , I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m an economist , and I &apos;m not going to be able to make sure that I &apos;m really worried about the fact that I &apos;m really worried about .
I didn &apos;t feel uncomfortable , but I didn &apos;t feel much worried , but I realized that I felt that I could feel that I could tell my stories about how far away I was going to be able to tell my stories about my journey .
And I was obsessed with my parents , and he came up with her .
And it turns out that there &apos;s no way that ordinary people were played : a lot of people who are the voices of normal people , and my daughters were a serious actor .
I had a little bit of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which was my second one .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;d like to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to sit , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you don &apos;t want to , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to sit down , you know , you &apos;re not going to sit on your shoulder , and you &apos;re not going to wake up , you know , you &apos;re going to wake up on the floor .
I didn &apos;t need it , I needed it , and I started to tell you about the story of my story .
The sound that I think is right at that moment .
You know , when you look at it , it &apos;s also a little bit like saying that if you look at it , it &apos;s also a little bit like that .
For instance , I &apos;ve been working as a student in college , and I &apos;d like to try and say , &quot; &quot; I want to tell you , I want you to go back to school . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I want you .
You can &apos;t get the news news for hours . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
After that , he started to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then the sense that my brother came up with a sense of generosity and hopelessness .
It &apos;s not the fact that if you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s not your own life , but it starts to wake up , and it starts to wake up .
This is the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
This is a kind of sound that you can see , and that &apos;s the kind of thing that you can do with the <unk> , which is the sound of the body .
For example , if I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to see myself , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell my life that I &apos;m not going to be able to see my life , and that &apos;s the kind of odd that we &apos;ve been able to see in my life .
The first time I was able to spend the first time in my life , more than three years ago , more than three years ago , more than three years ago , I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> ?
Where are the water in the water ?
No , let &apos;s put the water out of it , put it on the back of the teacher , &quot; &quot; I also figured out , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m curious .
After all , I had the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Two years later , he started <unk> .
No matter what I &apos;ve been hearing about all my senses : the horrific voices , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and my father said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you that you are more comfortable than that . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that you are more comfortable than that . &quot; &quot; And I was on a line , and I was on a line , and I was on a line .
Now , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to get rid of those images , and if you zoom in , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to see it .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to see it , and then you don &apos;t know that I &apos;m going to be able to get rid of it .
Many people are suffering from their suffering , and they &apos;re not going to be able to live , but they are very poor , very vulnerable to people who have helped me .
And my mother had no idea , and I had never been able to wake up , and I had never been able to convince her , and I had never been able to convince her , and my mother believed that one day , and my mom who was ready to make this happen , and my mother , I had to tell you , I didn &apos;t know what I was doing , but I didn &apos;t know what I was going on .
You know , Eleanor did that .
Now , if you sometimes don &apos;t know that if you sometimes don &apos;t like it , you &apos;re not going to be able to hear it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 14 years old , and I don &apos;t want to thank you for me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to thank you for me to thank you .
But they had the courage to get rid of their lives , and they had to be able to get rid of their lives , and they had the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;d like to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to be able to save me , I can tell you that if you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it , you &apos;re not going to be able to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to deal with something like that , you &apos;re not going to be able to deal with something like that , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve always been able to deal with , and I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you
And of course , what I &apos;ve been hearing about is hard to think about this , and that &apos;s hard to think about it as a result of the first time that the first time that the first step of my first door would be understood .
For instance , I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned about the temptation to attack on my face , not as much as I can see , but I also learned that I could tell you that I could feel the sense that I could feel and feel like I could .
I didn &apos;t believe it .
And if you don &apos;t even know that someday , I &apos;m not sure that if you don &apos;t want to sleep , I &apos;m not sure that you &apos;re going to be able to preserve it .
Now , the problem is that I &apos;ve got a lot of people who don &apos;t have the problem , and I &apos;m not going to be able to spend a lot of <unk> projects , and I &apos;m not going to be able to see that if you &apos;re not going to be able to make it work , you &apos;re not going to be able to see it .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know anything .
<unk> plastic bags ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I did .
And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , it &apos;s more important : I &apos;m not going to tell you how much I &apos;ve ever heard : I &apos;m not going to tell them how much I &apos;ve ever seen before , because I &apos;ve never been able to tell them how much I &apos;ve ever seen before , because I &apos;m not going to tell them how much I &apos;ve ever seen before , and I &apos;m also not going
I &apos;m going to ask them to be more confident , but I began to ask them , &quot; &quot; I started to ask them , &quot; &quot; I began to ask them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve started to learn how to communicate . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I started thinking about how I could communicate .
All of this happened when all of these things could happen , I learned that every single one of these things would happen , and I had never been able to deal with the fact that I had never been able to deal with it , and I learned that I had a tendency to find out that I could be able to make a difference between the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And I had to find that these scars , and I &apos;ve explored , and I &apos;ve discovered that I &apos;ve discovered that my name and <unk> and <unk> and so on and so forth , I &apos;ve discovered that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not part of the world .
And after that , after that , I was able to tell you that I &apos;ve been buried apart from my feet , and I &apos;m not going to get rid of it , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m going to get rid of it .
For the first time , 10 years later , I was able to remember that I was the highest amount of <unk> in the history of my hometown in the history of the 20th century , and a year later , I got the highest waterfall .
One of my favorites was to remember that I was going to die .
And in fact , if you don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t know that they don &apos;t work .
I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; as a verb .
At the same time , we &apos;re at the same time two <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to continue to spend a lot of time talking about my talk , and I &apos;m going to have a book that I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s what the most important question is that what &apos;s wrong with you , isn &apos;t it wrong .
For all of that time , I learned that I had to share with them , and I learned that I &apos;ve learned about my relationship with compassion and compassion .
The most powerful moment is that a woman who doesn &apos;t care about the fact that the women who want to talk about <unk> is a woman who doesn &apos;t want to help us .
What I &apos;m going to say is that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell the story of my <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is that I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you &apos;re going to get rid of your life . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , if you don &apos;t like that , you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s hard , you know
And if you can understand that , you can &apos;t understand that if you don &apos;t understand it , you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t understand it , you don &apos;t know how to make it .
It &apos;s possible that we &apos;ve been able to make this kind of society .
We have a tendency to say that in social change , there &apos;s no social difference .
It &apos;s not a <unk> person .
I don &apos;t want to ask people to do .
To me , I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to tell the story of justice , justice and justice just doesn &apos;t talk about the promise of justice , but it &apos;s not just the courage and the world .
In the last 20 years , in the last 20 years , we &apos;ve got five countries in 26 countries and 26 countries in 26 countries , and we &apos;re going to be able to hope that if you &apos;re not going to have access to hope , you need to hope that people have access to hope .
And as a verb , I was a believer in the spirit of the human spirit that we need to do with the human spirit , which is the need to be able to use the human mind .
This is one of the greatest challenges that we &apos;re going to be able to do , to make sure that one of the most likely needs to be , to share , to share , to share , to share , to share , to share .
We don &apos;t know that if we can , we don &apos;t know , we &apos;re not going to be able to take care of our lives .
We are <unk> . <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t happen to us , and it &apos;s not going to take us away from us .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Once I say to me , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you what you want to do with you .
I &apos;m not going to talk about it . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to tell you about it .
But that &apos;s why ?
Because , obviously , this is not a picture of a picture .
And yet , when I was 15 years old , he started when I was 15 years old .
This is the <unk> <unk> , and in a very different way , in a little different way , because when I was able to use the camera , I could make a process that &apos;s a process .
You can &apos;t take a picture of a picture , you know , <unk> <unk> .
To me , it wasn &apos;t going to be the fact that it &apos;s not going to be right in the right place .
I thought I could do this .
So what I &apos;d like to make is a different kind of thing , which is something different from the audience .
Now , images like this : this is what happens in a way that we can continue on a road .
But it &apos;s an unexpected game .
And yet , it looks like that .
Or the images like this — it &apos;s a dark matter , and it &apos;s also the color of the dark , but it &apos;s all the way that we can see it .
You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do , you know .
Because , of course , these are really not the images that we can &apos;t see , but we can &apos;t see the images that we &apos;re able to do with the camera .
To deal with the fact that we can &apos;t deal with a few minutes to deal with it .
So this is really the moment that we &apos;re able to make the right idea more properly than ever before .
What do you want to do with your real life ?
Have you ever stared at it ?
Have you ever met ?
What do you make ?
Sometimes we can &apos;t make the glue .
But at the end , we can deal with how to deal with the world , how to deal with the world .
It &apos;s not really what it is , it &apos;s really what we &apos;re going to tell us if we &apos;re real .
So , the basic idea is that it &apos;s really hard .
I &apos;m going to see this kind of thing that I &apos;m going to do with a real science , a reality that I &apos;ve never seen before .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here are three numbers that can imagine the potential for three numbers , a 3D printer in 3D printing .
But in a certain way , it looks like the object that exists again in a certain way .
And I also know that it can exist .
So we don &apos;t play games , because our brains don &apos;t have meaning that we don &apos;t have meaning .
And I &apos;m also seeing the same process as well .
And this is actually what we &apos;re talking about in a different way .
So , a picture is really clear about the real thing , I think it &apos;s not going to be talking about things , to everyday things , to everyday life .
And if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s really hard to do that , because if you don &apos;t think about it , it seems to be wrong .
So what I &apos;d like to suggest is that we have three simple rules that we need to take to get a real deal .
As you see , these images don &apos;t exist .
But if you don &apos;t .
So the first rule has to be the same for the first rule , the <unk> .
Secondly , it should be the same as the <unk> <unk> .
And in these two ways , these two variables — these are the same <unk> and the same material .
And third , you can see the shape of one of the images , where one of the dimensions started to come from , where they came from .
They &apos;re not going to be able to be able to get rid of it .
The color of the images between the images between the images , the color and the color of the color , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) People don &apos;t think that this is the bottom line , and I can tell you that this is the bottom line .
But it turns out that this is a picture that &apos;s happening in a different way .
I think it &apos;s a place where you can create a place where you can make a place , you know , if you &apos;re not going to change it in this way .
But it requires many ways .
And I had this idea that I had a few months to find a different place to find a different place to find a different place to find a different place to find a different place .
For example , the fish is a picture of the fish .
And they &apos;re different from our brains .
The water was taken from a coral reef .
And yes , even a lot of the island in the island of the island , I painted the island of the island of Sweden .
So , if you &apos;re going to get closer and closer to it , I think it &apos;s possible to share .
Every time it starts , it starts a cliff .
And then it comes together with different ways .
It &apos;s kind of like this , every piece of a piece .
And if you don &apos;t get good enough , it &apos;s pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s also quite beautiful .
That &apos;s what we need all of our senses , and the only thing that we can &apos;t do is dream .
Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian , thank you .
There was such a kind of kind of information that I &apos;ve been able to tell you about , in the last few years , the more information that you &apos;ve ever experienced in the last world than ever before .
This is <unk> ?
Julian Assange : Yes , that &apos;s possible ?
Now , the rest of the world is not going to be able to find that bad news in the world , but the whole world is able to be able to get rid of more and more relevant to the whole world than ever before .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people do that ?
How do you do that ?
JA : These are the kinds of things that we don &apos;t know about these things . We have different ways to do that .
In order to do what we need to do , we need to use the information to make the rest of the information , to make sure that we can use the information to make the rest of our lives .
It turns out that if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about , you know , if you don &apos;t understand it , you don &apos;t think that it &apos;s a little difficult news , you know — that &apos;s not a little hard time — it &apos;s a little hard to get rid of our lives , and we need to believe that we need to live in politics and political correctness .
CA : So I mean , you &apos;re going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re going to get rid of it .
JA : <unk> . You can &apos;t get them rare , and if we don &apos;t get rid of it , we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to get rid of it .
( Video ) <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I think we &apos;re going to be able to remember the <unk> code on the <unk> . ( Laughter )
And I think I &apos;m going to look at it .
This is a few years ago .
Let &apos;s look at this .
It was a story .
How do you want to talk about this story ?
JA : This is <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , in 2004 , it was <unk> by Kenya .
This year , 18 years ago , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He was <unk> <unk> .
And when we started with the power of the power , they were able to find two million tons of <unk> , and they were able to find two million people on the planet .
And the government of the government , and now , the most rich man , has been used to use the political power of the world .
It &apos;s like a book in Kenya .
In the 21st century , we were 28 years old , and I was able to get rid of it .
This is <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
CA : It &apos;s not directly directly directly in Kenya , not directly directly directly in Kenya , but it changed the way that it changed .
JA : Yes . And before we did it , we had to deal with <unk> , and then in the world , in the world , in Africa , in Africa , in Africa .
He came to <unk> .
In a few days , in Kenya , in Kenya , they started to be comfortable .
For 20 days , in Kenya , in Kenya , in Kenya , and the <unk> security of Kenya , you can &apos;t believe that if you &apos;re going to get 10 or 20 years old , you don &apos;t know that it &apos;s the way that you &apos;re going to die .
CA : So what about your knowledge really changed the world ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : Well , this time , there &apos;s a video about the weather industry .
This is a little clip . This is a short clip .
We have a little <unk> on this video .
<unk> : ... <unk> , <unk> .
Now , you can &apos;t see it now .
<unk> . <unk> .
You know , when you see it , the news is that there is no way .
They &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> !
( <unk> <unk> ) Go ahead .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know it , you can &apos;t see it .
They needed to go .
All right , we ate eight pounds .
We have two gaps , we &apos;re going to try to try .
All right . All died .
<unk> speaking , the English speaker .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> .
CA : CA : How did this video ?
JA : This is a lot of work for people who have been trained .
This is a video of two men who are connected to this video .
This is one of the three principles of mine .
CA : ( Applause ) Now , if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to have two friends in your life , then 9 men killed 11 ?
JA : Yes . Two Reuters workers died , two children injured .
And there was a man who <unk> the man .
CA : And this led to a broad <unk> .
Now , what was the most important part of my life ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people don &apos;t believe that if people don &apos;t know .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to see people flying on the table , it &apos;s not even a reason — and it &apos;s not even a reason — and even if you don &apos;t get rid of it , you don &apos;t know that if you haven &apos;t done it .
And I had two daughters who were very clear about my work , which was very clear about my work .
CA : Now , when the security of the United States doesn &apos;t predict the security of the United States , it was that I could tell you that when I was in the lab , I would have to tell you that when I was in the lab , I could tell you that when I was in the lab , I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
That &apos;s true ?
JA : We &apos;ve made this article in denial .
Well , five days ago , 150 days ago , 150 days ago , there were 150 students .
This is the year anniversary of the United States by the United States of America , but they don &apos;t have to do it with these people .
I was on my blog .
CA : If you had the U.S. government invested in diplomatic policy ?
JA : You can &apos;t get them . ( CA : Yeah . ) JA : Yes . ) JA : What do you do ? ) JA : What do you do ? ) JA : What do you know from Arabic is a human being in the world .
The secret to the secret is this kind of thing .
CA : I &apos;m not going to take a little bit of detail about it .
If you don &apos;t know , what do you get from ?
How do you feel like the secret to the secret ?
JA : There &apos;s a question that this is a question for the world , which is how to deal with climate change .
It &apos;s very soon .
If you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to be able to get the economic power to make sure that you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of those numbers , you can tell that they &apos;re going to be new and good .
It &apos;s always going to be like this . It depends on its history .
CA : But if you &apos;re not going to be able to get a little bit of trouble , you &apos;re not really sure that it &apos;s a lot of people who have it , but it &apos;s not a bad result .
JA : Well , let &apos;s get rid of it .
So , you know , you have <unk> <unk> .
There are some kind of personal skills that I can &apos;t think of , and then we can do it with the essence of it .
There &apos;s also a <unk> — like , you know , if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
CA : Exactly : Exactly .
If you don &apos;t want to tell you , the son of the U.S. government has to tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell you that if you don &apos;t want to make a decision if you don &apos;t want someone else ?
It shows that people don &apos;t believe that if they don &apos;t know .
This shows that there are millions of people around the world that have millions of people around the world . They don &apos;t really do it .
My son doesn &apos;t like that . What do you do with your colleagues ? &quot; &quot; What do you ask ?
JA : There &apos;s a lot of crap .
But if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t have to be able to tell people , you don &apos;t have to be able to do it every day .
It doesn &apos;t tell them that they don &apos;t have the idea of the idea .
Every day , you get rid of it .
It &apos;s not about the fact that people spend money in the world , but that &apos;s what it is .
CA : So you can &apos;t find a way to make a way out of the world , and you can &apos;t figure out a way to make the secret .
It &apos;s good .
But that &apos;s a strange thing that &apos;s very strange that you can &apos;t see if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know .
JA : Not exactly that . But it &apos;s not right .
Or no matter what it &apos;s like to do .
If you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s hard for us . We &apos;re not going to do it , and people work on us , and they try to help us support our lives .
CA : ( Applause ) Now , what do you think I &apos;m talking about is really interesting — what do you do about this ?
There are two kinds of ideas about depression and Julian .
One — you can &apos;t get rid of it .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Who did it ?
Why don &apos;t you get it ?
JA : Well , no , no , no matter .
CA : These are people who are people , Julian .
I &apos;m a little bit more optimistic . There &apos;s another example .
I think I &apos;m not going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m not going to do it .
Isn &apos;t that curious about this curious question ?
What do you believe in ?
JA : This is a <unk> <unk> that we see every day .
The last year we &apos;ve been trained in the Gulf of Mexico , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We had an engineer , so we had this kind of an engineer , and we &apos;ve actually been able to do the way that we were able to get rid of the benefits of the plants that we don &apos;t know .
And there was a lot of people here , and we have others here .
There was no excuse for them , there was no excuse for them .
We didn &apos;t know who she was , and he didn &apos;t know .
It &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , which is a zero-sum game .
So , if you look at the literature , you can say , &quot; &quot; We are a little <unk> .
We can &apos;t know how to do it .
Okay . Okay . It looks right , but we can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; No , we want to find out that we &apos;re going to make these kinds of things that are going on , and we call this &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And we said , &quot; &quot; We want to find a little bit .
What do you want to talk about ?
Have you ever been able to tell you that ?
Really ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re the answer to the <unk> that you can see on the screen on the screen .
You can &apos;t see that .
( Applause ) There &apos;s a lot of crap .
It &apos;s one of the ways that we &apos;ve been able to find a number of letters , one of the ways that we &apos;ve experienced a number of letters .
CA : Which would you have to see if you don &apos;t know ?
JA : Yes , I was also very , very , very , very , very , very quickly to keep the rest of our lives .
For the past few months , the past few months for the past few months , we need to get the right news for the past few months .
This is a little problem .
And in other words , as you can imagine in other words , there is no way that we can see that there are no more information that you can see , but if you don &apos;t have enough information , you don &apos;t have enough resources to make all this data .
CA : ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , what do you need to tell you is that you &apos;re not going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re going to be able to take care of you ?
JA : Yeah . There are people .
Now , in order to grow up in a very different way , it &apos;s really hard to develop .
CA : So why don &apos;t you really deal with that ?
We &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Is that this information ?
JA : I had a film <unk> , and I was a religious believer in religious literature .
( Laughter ) CA : I &apos;m not going to tell you that this carpet is not going to happen .
JA : What do you mean by movie exploration ?
( Laughter ) CA : ( Applause ) CA : ( Applause ) CA : Well , I &apos;m not going to tell you that when you &apos;re in the young age , you would have the problem .
JA : <unk> .
I was one of my young friends .
You can &apos;t see what I &apos;m talking about in young age in young years old .
We need to make a little bit of friction .
It &apos;s possible to do different kinds of things .
Now , unfortunately , most of the reason that we &apos;ve been able to do this is that in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , they &apos;re going to spend a lot of time in the banking industry .
It &apos;s not just as before before .
CA : I can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t think that you &apos;re going to die , you can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t think about it .
You can make a short amount of information about them , or why do you want to talk about it ?
JA : I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case .
But the question is : I don &apos;t think that if you don &apos;t know it , people don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know it , people will help us .
My father was my father , my father , my father , who I learned from people like my father .
CA : And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know about the human being , you can &apos;t see them ?
JA : I &apos;m not going to give them a little bit of trouble , but I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know them , but in terms of the way — you can &apos;t see the people who are looking at it .
This is what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : CA : What do you want to talk about in the last few decades ?
And there was a problem that I couldn &apos;t see here , and I was given the information that the information that was happening there .
And you can &apos;t get rid of it .
We didn &apos;t get good enough . And then what happened ?
JA : This is a big issue .
It was an economic recession .
It was one of the largest members in the world .
The streets were 10 years old , 10 years old .
This is the data that came last last year .
When I was five years ago when I was five years ago , I had five days before he started , and he started five months ago , and he began to get five months ago , and he didn &apos;t know what he &apos;d like to do .
And I didn &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not going to tell you a lot about it , but I &apos;m not going to tell you about the problem .
And everyone in the audience would have thought that this would be a little bit more worried about , and that &apos;s where we have a couple of years old , and then , in fact , a few years ago , there would be a new law in the world , which is a new law in the world , which is a new law in the world , which is one of the greatest funders in the world , the Nobel Prize in the world .
And I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to get rid of the rest of the closet .
And just one month ago , this law was known as secret as a secret .
CA : Thank you .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> .
What would you like to see if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do ? You know , you &apos;re going to be able to watch every single thing in the world , where people are going to be watching the Great Leader , or they &apos;re going to be able to watch the Great Leader .
JA : I &apos;m not sure why it &apos;s going to happen .
All of our dreams are going to be able to talk about all sorts of things , and we don &apos;t talk about each other , and we don &apos;t talk about it .
It &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s going on .
We &apos;re very curious about how curious that we live in our lives .
CA : I feel like you know what you &apos;re talking about , Julian , <unk> , <unk> .
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I did .
When I was writing books and writing books , I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what I &apos;d like to talk about , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about these things .
But let me tell you earlier , let me tell you about my personal experience .
I &apos;m not going to be able to use it , so I &apos;m not going to use it — I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m worried about it .
To me , I was a kid who was not the only child who was born .
In the 1970s , it was a little strange .
Most of them were the vast majority of our family members of our family , who are the only living women who were living in their lives .
And in fact , both of those two principles are <unk> .
On a side side side , I was <unk> , contemporary , contemporary American women .
On the other side side , I was always religious , religious , <unk> , less <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of people who are deeply influenced by <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Every time I went to wake up anyway , despite the fact that we were able to get to see the red number that we could get to get the red red .
And then I &apos;d like to spend a lot of time on my shoulder .
A week later , I couldn &apos;t get sick for a week .
And I know that I know that some of you would have been curious about this , and I know how many of the people would have been able to talk about them , and they would have been able to tell the people that they would be able to put together in different ways , and they don &apos;t believe that people would be able to get rid of them .
And I said , how did it do that ? That &apos;s the power force ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , you &apos;ve got to get rid of it , but the power of the power is the power . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a lot of important lessons inside of that . If you don &apos;t think of it in life , you need a lot of important lessons , whether it &apos;s in life , whether it &apos;s in life , and whether it &apos;s in life , whether it &apos;s your soul and the spirit of human spirit .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Each of us can now have social and cultural heritage .
We all live .
We all live in a sense , a ring , a ring in the room .
But if we don &apos;t want to be able to live in the world that we &apos;ve experienced in the world , we &apos;re not going to be able to have the risk of being able to communicate from the world .
We can &apos;t make the power of our bodies . We can &apos;t get rid of our lives .
We don &apos;t believe that if we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not going to take care of our lives , we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of our lives , and we &apos;re not going to get rid of our lives .
As the woman <unk> <unk> , they did something like this , and they didn &apos;t sit down on the sidewalk , and I would like to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to sit on the sidewalk , you don &apos;t know .
This is what I &apos;m going to be able to do . I &apos;ve been able to do a lot of time for a lot of time for a man to make sure a lot of people live .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , that &apos;s one of the greatest challenges that you &apos;re sharing is one of the greatest challenges we share .
And that &apos;s happening everywhere , between the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to be able to make a difference , and they don &apos;t talk about it .
It could be the main way that we have to believe that this is the main way that we have this cultural heritage .
I can &apos;t tell the stories that I &apos;m talking about when I &apos;m listening to stories of stories .
So , if you look at this , we can see other worlds , even if we can see other worlds .
I started to find stories about eight years old .
And one day my mother gave me a <unk> <unk> , and he said it would be a good idea for me to get there .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to make the idea of that presentation , it &apos;s a little <unk> .
He was very good at home , and it was good for those stories , but these stories weren &apos;t good at all .
I didn &apos;t know whether I was a kid who was going to take a conversation when I was going to get a conversation with my father , I was a kid who was a kid in my life , and my mother would tell me that if my mother had a good idea , I didn &apos;t understand it .
But he didn &apos;t know that I was talking about the stories of my life , and what I &apos;d like to do with my life was to talk about what was happening .
And instead , I began to write about myself , not about myself , but I started writing about things .
And I began to find out if I didn &apos;t know what I was talking about .
It was the stories that I had to share with you , the stories of other people , the stories of other people .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about this : this is what I &apos;ve been hearing about in my life .
This is another event that happened to <unk> .
My mother became a diplomat .
And I also got this little , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where I was in the middle of my hometown , I was in the middle of my country .
For the first time , I had a hard time when I had a hard time to express the phrase &quot; &quot; typical foreign Street . &quot; &quot; And all of my daughters had kids , and I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d like to tell you when I was in the audience .
And as you can imagine , kids don &apos;t think that kids don &apos;t want to do anything but not themselves .
It was also fun in the United States , and it was fun , and it was fun for every time every time I had a conversation with no choice or a conversation .
And if you feel like this , you always get sick , you &apos;re always worried .
And it was good for me , when I was in school , when I was in this age of school , when I was in the middle of my life , he made sure that he was <unk> , and he made a little bit of zero-g .
( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;m often aware of the frustration that I &apos;m talking about as soon as I &apos;m talking about .
For the first time , I saw this idea of cultural heritage .
All the kids were saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) If you don &apos;t know about a few <unk> days , you can &apos;t sleep on all the <unk> nights , so I don &apos;t know if I could sleep all the time , so I can tell you that I didn &apos;t want to sleep .
I &apos;ve learned about three stories on my face , and these are the <unk> , the smoking and the head .
After all , we were able to get rid of our lives , and we need to reconnect it .
And I think that I &apos;m going to be able to imagine that I &apos;m not going to be able to live with my dreams , and I &apos;m going to think that it &apos;s a little bit of length .
The stories that give me a sense of awareness and the sense that my daughters had to feel a sense of solidarity , the sense that my daughters and <unk> .
I was 20 years old when I was 20 years old .
Thank you very much , and I &apos;m a living physicist , and I &apos;ve written a lot about it .
I was there when I was 14 years old when I was born .
I didn &apos;t know what I was looking at when I was looking at the building of our buildings .
We had an old vendor , an old vendor , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the vibrant life of the adult life .
It was a long black hole in the middle of the mountain , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I saw that I was able to put it on my shoulder , and I saw an opportunity to put it on my shoulder , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t believe that when I was on the table , I was unable to sleep on the couch .
If you don &apos;t know about death and death , we &apos;re going to be able to find out if you don &apos;t know , if you &apos;re a few years old .
But I &apos;m always worried about the fact that they have sex .
I don &apos;t want to tell you that if you &apos;re a strong novel , you can &apos;t tell a good novel , but if you don &apos;t have a good novel , you don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be able to tell your kids that they &apos;re not really good at all , and sometimes we don &apos;t want to tell the people that we &apos;re not good at all .
And then I went on to get married , and then I went on to meet my daughters .
It &apos;s not alone , but the language of language is exactly the same .
I started writing .
If you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know why I don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t know why I want to change the way .
I mean , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of your life , you get more and more <unk> , and I think it &apos;s a lot more beautifully and more hopeful .
I think we don &apos;t think differently .
I &apos;ve also learned about the way in the world as human beings around the world , the language of English .
<unk> language later , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then , as a result later , we want to talk to more and better words , better words , better words , because our brains and our languages have bigger differences between our brains and our language .
This is the difference .
But if you don &apos;t think about it , that &apos;s what you can see .
This was what I learned when I was living — I was a <unk> and bust .
Now , in the middle of that time , I &apos;ve been able to train all of my life out in my daily life , so I could find that in my everyday life , my life , and then in my daily life , I would have been able to find a place where I could live .
You know , we don &apos;t care about a family of family life .
( Laughter ) But instead , I visited the <unk> .
And I began to find out that when my wife knew that my life was in the Arizona Istanbul , I was able to do that as much as I could find out of the world .
For me , I &apos;m always going to be thinking about the physical and physical reality .
It &apos;s almost as if all of our rituals and minds have always been lost for me .
And I could tell you that the story of the story that I &apos;m worried about , that I was able to make the story more than I was on my shoulder .
I &apos;d like to tell you about this problem .
And one of the things I wrote was a <unk> that I wrote in the United States in America , which was one of the founders of the United States .
&quot; I went to the book . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a little bit of <unk> . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked what I mean .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you look , you can see that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , you have a lot of <unk> , U.S. , <unk> <unk> , which is also a man . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m a believer in college . You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know what it meant to me .
But I also know it &apos;s always going to continue .
He wanted me to be my personal experience .
That was because I was a woman who was a woman who was a woman who was women who were women .
And I &apos;ve always been able to solve the world around the world , and this is what we can do with it , and that &apos;s how we deal with it , and then we can see that it &apos;s going on .
Most of them don &apos;t know , especially if I don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not supposed to be <unk> .
If I don &apos;t know about Islam in the Muslim world , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the women who are talking about Islam , which is better than women .
More <unk> , depressing , <unk> stories , the typical story that we don &apos;t want to get away from our cities .
This is the world of the world that I &apos;m talking about , which is the world of the world .
It &apos;s not as creative as creative people , not as creative as creative people , but as a few author <unk> , a friend of mine , a friend of mine .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> .
In 1998 , when I was a writer , I was asked to tell him about the question of a few times a few times a few years ago .
And if you don &apos;t know about the fact that you can see it , the blue writer , the blue writer , said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t have anything to do with you ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you can imagine that there &apos;s nothing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the same .
This is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which has no <unk> <unk> .
About 10 years ago , a few years ago , I was very good fliers .
They were three years old , a man , a man , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) But it wasn &apos;t that we &apos;re going to put us together and we don &apos;t care about it .
It was alone .
We need to write real stories on the other side .
It &apos;s called a <unk> .
In this way , it &apos;s not alone , it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re even more likely to be able to make it more than you know .
We don &apos;t believe that the story is not going to happen , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
All around the world .
I saw this for the first time when I was the first time I was in 1958 , I didn &apos;t know that I was going on .
Now , I &apos;m not talking about the fact that women are facing the eye , and I &apos;m not talking about the fact that we &apos;re going to talk about it .
It &apos;s a big big deal with some of the small predictions of the <unk> .
There are some people who were talking about <unk> <unk> , and some people don &apos;t know me , some of them did .
But I &apos;d like to tell you all of the things that are happening at that moment .
Just a story .
He said , &quot; &quot; Just a story , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; Just a story . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t matter how to deal with it , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
You can &apos;t see if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t see if you don &apos;t know , but if you don &apos;t have political challenges , you don &apos;t think about everyday language .
And if you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to get the right thing , you &apos;re not going to get the right to the right .
And it &apos;s a job that we &apos;re trying to do . &quot; &quot; You can get rid of it . You can &apos;t understand it .
One is a lot of <unk> .
It &apos;s thick .
One moves .
You can &apos;t see the front floor .
You &apos;re not going to get rid of your mind .
It &apos;s water from water .
There was a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re not going to tell you stories .
We need to put it in a variety of different ways to make a sense of expression .
You know , if you don &apos;t hear it , you don &apos;t know , people don &apos;t hear it , you can &apos;t hear it , you know .
The stories of stories . It &apos;s the Middle Ages , North Africa , North Africa .
Today , stories today , stories of stories .
You know , when you &apos;re talking about it , and you &apos;re talking to each other , you don &apos;t hear anything else , but you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , and you &apos;re saying that you &apos;re not going to be able to make the rest of your life .
They &apos;re not going to get us further away .
If you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s not a good thing .
It saved my life in a middle class , and it saved my life .
But there &apos;s also a lot of surprises .
After all , in the spirit of the spirit of the spirit and the spirit of the spirit of the spirit , the first job , the first job , was to watch the story of what had written in his head when she came back into the water .
To say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell you that if you don &apos;t want to tell you that you don &apos;t want to tell you that you &apos;re not going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to have the problem . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be able to solve the problem that we can &apos;t solve today &apos;s problem , and we have a lot of people who don &apos;t have the problem , and we have a lot of people who don &apos;t have the problem .
There is a <unk> <unk> : I &apos;m not going to live as the action .
And one of them is fixed .
On the other side , it makes a permanent difference , each of the other aspects .
I didn &apos;t believe that .
And part of the story that you can see is that you &apos;re not going to be able to make a part of it .
This is a kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I believe that it &apos;s everywhere .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of your mind .
It exists in a place called <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s where it is between .
That &apos;s what I do .
We often know that if we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to die .
They &apos;re trying to find out where they &apos;re going to find out where they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to call <unk> .
But what I think I think is that we should be able to get rid of our lives .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
I &apos;m not sure about 10 years ago .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
This is a little bit about a woman , and I can tell you about a big probability woman , and there &apos;s going to be a real probability woman , which is a big chance .
As long as you &apos;ve got to go through , you can see a little bit about it .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , our ancestors tell us , &quot; &quot; which says , &quot; &quot; Oh , our ancestors says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a great example .
And I &apos;m going to deal with that , why don &apos;t we still think about things that we don &apos;t yet think about things that we don &apos;t know .
Maybe it &apos;s not really good to start .
It &apos;s not based on what we are , and what we &apos;re thinking about is not based on what we are .
We need to talk to each other about a sense that we can connect to each other .
If you don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not going to meet other worlds .
You know , I &apos;m not going to go back to the supermarket .
I &apos;m not standing in the political condition in the political condition , they &apos;re all <unk> . And this is good .
We &apos;re going to start to finish by saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s a little <unk> that &apos;s going to be able to find a lot of big ideas to make a difference .
This is a little <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , here is a <unk> part of the <unk> .
<unk> .
And I had to deal with my parents .
Two years ago , half a year ago , I didn &apos;t believe that .
My head was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I started to realize that when I was born .
And I didn &apos;t believe that there were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I can tell you that it &apos;s not the only way to be happy to be happy .
( Applause ) This is when we are women who are women .
The bottom line is the most underlying factor .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Because I &apos;m very sorry , I &apos;m not sure that you can &apos;t see it .
This was when I was talking about a couple of years ago , when I was talking about the last night , I was talking about the <unk> night .
I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; — obviously — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
If we were five hours old , if it was five hours ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Most of you have ever been able to get less trouble .
Here we are , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be eight years old , but I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know , because I don &apos;t know , because it &apos;s true economic , political , political , and
They need to be able to have a <unk> .
Not to be a good leader , not a good leader , but I didn &apos;t get a good leader .
You don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know it , it &apos;s not enough .
I think the winner is the winner of the big investment in the <unk> , and I &apos;m still standing in the middle of the world .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> 24 hours from 24 hours a day , maybe eight or eight hours old , and maybe it would cause what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s the most useful for the world that we live in a place where we live in a place where we live in a place where we live in a place where we live in a place where we live in our lives .
I &apos;m more optimistic that I &apos;m going to tell you , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you &apos;re a big deal , you can find the power of your devices .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Now , if you don &apos;t think about the brain , the brain is <unk> .
What is the problem ?
Dr. <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Normal as a normal phrase , I think that we need to tell people that we don &apos;t want to be normal . &quot;
And I learned about the disease that I didn &apos;t know .
I was like a kid who was a kid who was a kid .
If you can measure the brain , the brain is made up of two roles .
This is a part of the landscape that &apos;s in the background .
They &apos;re parallel with parallel .
I had two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then I think about the different things about different things , and even more different things happen .
For a minute , forgive me . Thank you very much . <unk> .
The right brain is the way that we &apos;re able to do the same way in the lab .
We &apos;re not going to be able to tell all the things that we &apos;re going to do at the moment that we &apos;re not going to be able to talk to all of our minds , how to do that , how do you feel , how do you feel , how do you feel .
We &apos;re not one of our brains with the energy that our brains interact with .
And at that point , this is the perfect , right .
The left brain is a completely different place .
( Laughter ) And I think I can &apos;t get the <unk> .
And the piece of information that we can put on left is that part of the information that you can find on the left side of the leg .
And the left brain is a language .
We can &apos;t live our lives on the outside world .
This is a sound that says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go home .
And what I &apos;ve always got to tell us is that we need to get rid of our lives .
And I was on my own journey , and I started to play sports with my team .
I mean , you know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying is , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
I feel like I can go on my shoulder .
And I decided to take a shower .
<unk> <unk> .
I can &apos;t understand the atomic atomic nucleus .
And the only thing I could do was the outside energy — power energy .
Have you ever wondered what ?
That &apos;s everywhere .
You know , I feel like I can &apos;t see .
You don &apos;t think that you &apos;re going to get your eyes .
He was feeling sick .
And again , my left brain is <unk> .
And in that moment , right now , right now .
And then , &quot; &quot; Oh ! !
( Laughter ) And then I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m a lot of <unk> ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
You need to get rid of it , you need to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
We &apos;re going to try to call it .
And if you don &apos;t want to go back to the rest of you .
So that &apos;s one of the things that we &apos;ve been hearing about , which is one of the numbers that the phone had led to the telephone .
Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about the Golden Rule .
What if you don &apos;t understand my life in my life .
And with my brain , between two of the stars , between two and two conflicts between the brain , between two and two .
It &apos;s how big it is .
Or , just a little bit , I &apos;m not alone , I &apos;m not lonely .
You &apos;re not going to get rid of your right leg .
