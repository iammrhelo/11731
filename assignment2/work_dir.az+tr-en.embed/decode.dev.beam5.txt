And when I was 11 years old , I was 11 years old , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My father was listening to the BBC , BBC <unk> .
We had no idea that we didn &apos;t know that we didn &apos;t have anything that we weren &apos;t talking about , because we don &apos;t know it .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban shall &apos;t go back ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) My father was my father .
I can &apos;t deal with what this meant , but I didn &apos;t know how happy it was .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the middle school . &quot; &quot; I was my father .
Have you ever met a morning .
The real school .
I was six years old when the Taliban came to school for girls and girls .
So , in the next five years , I &apos;ve been trained as a boy to go to the secret school , and I was like a boy to go to the secret school .
And that was the only way we could get education in education .
Every single day , you can &apos;t know who &apos;s not going to live in a different way .
The market sold to the market , which is not just <unk> .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t want a home , it &apos;s a man who has a little baby .
It was comfortable when he was comfortable , but it would be hot .
We knew that our fears and our fears are not going to be able to stop our lives .
And sometimes , for the Taliban , we &apos;re not going to take a school in schools .
But what I &apos;m always worried about is that we &apos;re not going to be able to get it .
What do you know ?
Where are we living ?
We don &apos;t know , but again , schools , schools .
Well , I was very lucky , and I was a friend of mine who was interested in a family , and I was a believer in a hospital .
My father was a man who was a human .
He had a different idea that lives in a world that lived in a row in a row , and I didn &apos;t believe that , in fact , he preferred , and he said , &quot; &quot; Even by the father of the father , the father was punished by the father .
But my mother saw my father .
They &apos;re not .
Two years ago , I went to school two years ago , and I went to school for women and women .
And my father — that &apos;s the first time that he was in the first place .
And it was also that he didn &apos;t even have the courage to take care of his education .
To him , I was more likely to teach him about education .
It would be the end of the Taliban , in the middle , in the middle , in the middle , in the middle of the closet , and I can &apos;t see a ray of light in my life .
And I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d like to do with my parents , and my father said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t know , you can see it , you can put everything in your pocket .
You can &apos;t see it <unk> . You can put it in war .
But if you don &apos;t know that the only thing that happens is that you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to live schools , you &apos;re not going to go to school , you know , if you &apos;re not going to live school , you &apos;re not going to go to school .
Now , now we continue to continue to continue to continue ? &quot; &quot; This is 22 years old .
I grew up in a country where I grew up in 10 countries .
And less than six percent of them are in middle school , middle school , and if you don &apos;t know , if you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it , then I &apos;m not going to do it .
And I &apos;m not going to see , here , here , I &apos;m not going to be able to imagine that you &apos;re going to be able to make a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> , one of the founders of my life , was my father , was my father , was my father , was my father &apos;s father .
Not just because I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m the first woman , but I &apos;m not sure that I was the first woman in Kabul .
( Applause ) I &apos;m sorry .
There &apos;s the Great lobe , which is more than my <unk> .
And so , in fact , in a global understanding of education , we &apos;ve moved to a global ethic in education .
This is why , in Afghanistan , in a country , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , the first boarding school .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying is that students who are responsible for the most important part of the world that we need to do .
And when the ancestors came , their ancestors , their ancestors , were able to learn how to live with all of our fears , all of our minds .
And I can &apos;t tell you . I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t hear it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to get one of my daughters .
About a month ago , I was able to put it together with a couple of minutes ago , and the way that we could find the way that the road was released by a few minutes .
They &apos;d go home to the phone rings , and they &apos;d put it on the phone , and if you want to go back to school , if you want to go back to school , you don &apos;t know .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re not going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you , I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to live . &quot; &quot; And what I &apos;ve learned about time is that , sometimes
That means that we don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
And in fact , the ancestors of the ancestors were bright , and they didn &apos;t know that they could be able to hide , but they didn &apos;t believe that as a <unk> , they don &apos;t know .
When girls go to school , they have hundreds of thousands of girls who go to school , and they don &apos;t , like , they don &apos;t .
And in fact , in Afghanistan , girls are living in three million tons .
( Applause ) <unk> are different from the United States .
The Americans don &apos;t believe that the Americans don &apos;t believe that they are .
This is a change in the United States after the United States of America .
But what I &apos;m saying is that if you &apos;re living in school , and if you &apos;re living in the classroom , and if you &apos;re living in your life , it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a whole bunch of people who have a whole bunch of options .
To me , I was able to tell you that girls and I don &apos;t know , and I &apos;d like to tell you every day that girls from there were never going to give me every day .
And they &apos;re not going to be big enough .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We go back to the table , and everybody knows that there &apos;s a lot of opportunities that are going down in two half hours , and you &apos;re going down on the next two hours .
And so you can see that you can see that you &apos;re not going to see here , but you &apos;re not going to be able to see it , but you &apos;re not going to be able to see .
It &apos;s a blade , moist , <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s cute . And finally , it &apos;s cute .
<unk> design is design .
It &apos;s almost every one of our senses , every single one .
This unknown world .
It &apos;s underwater , underwater , underwater .
It &apos;s a place where you can see a space , and you can &apos;t see it .
The female actually sees that the female is only more <unk> than ever before .
So , let &apos;s go back . You can see the bubbles : the net network on the right , on the left .
Let &apos;s take a step back , put it back into the stratosphere .
I don &apos;t know . I love it . This is a giant <unk> .
Watch it . It takes them inside it . It makes it a lot like seaweed .
They &apos;re <unk> .
This is a rock game , which is a lot of new things .
And it &apos;s a miracle . It &apos;s incredible , right ? Roger him .
And again , <unk> <unk> says , &quot; &quot; Uh , he &apos;s seen .
That &apos;s when the best thing is possible when it &apos;s possible .
<unk> , it &apos;s coming back .
One . Three . Three .
And if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to pay attention to the outside world .
Everything until everything else .
When we see our first public sector , we can see that we can see our first public life .
And I didn &apos;t know that I &apos;d never met .
Now , I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to be able to get the rest of your life .
And so you can see that in fact , you &apos;re not going to be able to see the growth of the growth of China .
This is a part of the landscape .
It &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to go back to the grave .
And I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
Every thing I want to talk about is what I &apos;m talking about .
You can &apos;t answer questions .
A police worker , a police worker .
But most people don &apos;t believe in the U.S.
And while I was lucky , I was lucky enough to find that many of the arctic mountains of Titan .
And then , after a new language , it would have been made by a new language , and then all of the rest of a sudden .
They &apos;re not going to meet South Africa .
We all had lost our lives , but 67 years of life , after the age of 67 , we all had lost and <unk> .
Have South Korea or South Korea ?
So I started to take them out of how to save them .
And I started out in the middle of North America .
We need to deal with the Chinese in China .
We &apos;re going to stand up and stand up .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know .
But short years later , I had the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re very lucky , but they &apos;re not going to be able to get a short <unk> in South Asia .
Nobody I met .
And I &apos;ve talked about the fact that I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to be able to make it work , you &apos;re not going to spend the rest of your life .
I didn &apos;t believe that my life was in my life .
They &apos;re very little , very little , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not sure at TED .
This is the kid we did in 2009 .
We &apos;re going to make it the same way .
It &apos;s going to go through the building of the Earth .
Now , you know , kids don &apos;t hear more than their kids .
The building looks like this .
Why don &apos;t you do that ?
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to have . &quot;
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to make it possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; How do you wake up in your life ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know . &quot;
So I used to try and run around with the <unk> .
There are three variables in the building .
And they did not let me go through that .
But right now , it &apos;s used to be used by other words .
They &apos;re not going to go on the floor .
The kids don &apos;t want to go .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , if you don &apos;t get a tree of tree , you &apos;re going to die .
This is the boy that you see , this boy , that it takes so much attention .
( Laughter ) Every time you get a <unk> , they &apos;re sitting on the line .
That &apos;s pretty cute .
You &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve been able to make it possible for our kids , because we &apos;re not just under their kids , but we want to see .
And I &apos;m not going to see it very high , but you can see the ceiling .
And that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be — there &apos;s all kinds of water gaps .
And you see , you know , agile pipes , you know , you don &apos;t know whether you &apos;re going to get <unk> , you can &apos;t see it .
But you can see that boy , the boy would be able to get rid of it on the beach , and I couldn &apos;t find them with water .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a whole time when it comes to the last year of the year .
It doesn &apos;t have any <unk> and <unk> .
And it turns out that it &apos;s a lot of things that are happening .
There is no way between the <unk> .
You don &apos;t know .
Most of those kids are not going to be able to get rid of their lives .
But it doesn &apos;t cause any reason to do .
Because there is no excuse .
And he says , &quot; &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t want to be the guy sitting in the middle room , I can go back and go .
They &apos;re not going to go back , so you can &apos;t go back and get back .
( Laughter ) I mean , if you don &apos;t hear anything like this , kids don &apos;t like that .
Here &apos;s what they go back and again .
And that &apos;s natural .
Secondly , we do not think of it as important as important .
You know , kids don &apos;t feel better than their kids .
And it &apos;s everywhere .
When our kids are sitting there , they &apos;re not going to be able to get high expectations .
You know , you don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know .
I need to make them sound .
And you know , you know , I &apos;m not going to talk to you on the floor , you know , you &apos;re not going to hear it .
We need to be able to get rid of it .
You know , at the time , we &apos;re not going to try to do anything .
This is okay .
We need to go out to be clear that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to get warm enough to get rid of it .
We &apos;re going to get rid of it .
You can &apos;t get 50 degrees Fahrenheit .
It was water .
They &apos;re <unk> .
So I &apos;m not going to make sure .
And so we don &apos;t like this kind of thing .
And here they work with the <unk> .
We &apos;re actually going to help us .
But they don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) And this is what these children are looking for .
And this is also what we can do .
And that &apos;s what we can do .
There &apos;s a good conversation here .
We have <unk> <unk> .
It works on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) More . ( Laughter )
Every time I was in class , I have no excuse .
It comes from Santa Fe .
And this is the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of those stars in orbit .
It &apos;s five yards away , and we &apos;re seven yards away .
It &apos;s very clear that we have a lot of attention .
The idea is to make the idea .
You don &apos;t let a girl show a girl .
They &apos;re trying to make it <unk> .
You can &apos;t get there .
They don &apos;t know , but they don &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t believe it . It was my father .
( Laughter ) This is how much safe is to look at how safe it is .
And then other kids were locked in .
You know , you have a lot of surprises .
( Laughter ) <unk> is trying to learn how to do the driver .
They need to be able to get a little bit more likely to be able to get it .
They &apos;re not going to help them go together .
This is a <unk> , and we need to make these kinds of opportunities .
This is a picture of a boy who &apos;s going to take an hour when he ran an hour .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
Not bad .
So , this little morning , this little morning , about six yards away .
But we still don &apos;t know .
This is <unk> kids on a daily basis .
The kids who are lucky enough to be among their kids .
And they always say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want them to get them . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know them .
You &apos;re not going to go on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t want to go . ( Laughter )
I think they don &apos;t have to protect them , and they don &apos;t need to protect them , but they don &apos;t need to do it .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Because this is what we can do in life .
We need to focus on the world , the world that we can see in the world .
This building is one of the things that kids like to change .
Thank you .

And in the 1970s , the rise of China in the 1970s , I was in New York City .
When I was a kid , I was able to train all of my colleagues in my village in my village , and I had all the <unk> <unk> .
But my mother said , &quot; &quot; No , no . &quot; &quot; And my father said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; No . &quot;
It was a <unk> , and then it was the only way that it &apos;s going to be good and safe and safe and safe .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it doesn &apos;t matter .
But my wish was to be an opera lesson in China .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been able to do in this way .
I need to be happy to be happy to be sitting in the middle of the opera , and I decided to go to the opera class .
Even in fact , I wrote a letter to my graduate school radio radio .
But I &apos;m not going to ask my idea .
Nobody believed I am .
But my friends , I would have experienced my friends like me , who had kids like me .
So when I was 15 years old , I started to deal with the <unk> .
They didn &apos;t know that they didn &apos;t know .
They &apos;re not going to be able to make the second class in the second class , which would be the only option in the second classroom .
But that was the case .
We need to make a way out of a way .
They don &apos;t want to ask me to do that ? No offense .
I did not know what I did .
I had to tell you that this book was made by <unk> , which was made by <unk> , and I made this book that I was saying , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been able to take a model of a woman , and I &apos;ve been able to take a model of the woman , and I &apos;ve learned about the woman , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned that I had to tell you , &quot; &quot;
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Video ) Narration : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When I was in the late 1990s , when I was in the 19th century ?
And of course , you can &apos;t see the inside of the tent .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; .
You don &apos;t have any benefits . I &apos;m very sorry .
It &apos;s interesting , a little bit strange .
( Laughter ) This is another day .
But in my fifth grade , my fifth birthday , I said , &quot; &quot; Dad and the honor of honor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a different way of saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to give you a sense of possibility that I &apos;m not going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
It allowed me to add to the <unk> of my new friends .
That can tell you a lot of things .
For example , this map of the map seemed strange to me , because we don &apos;t know , because we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
Have you ever imagined that the growth of the China is not in the center of the world .
Well , the map shows you the map of the map .
It &apos;s not a new thing .
This is a standard configuration in the science world .
Even in fact , there &apos;s science in science , and there &apos;s science in science fiction .
It &apos;s helping us to help us with our lives and our fears .
And I &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to work for the study that we &apos;ve been able to get in everyday life in everyday life ?
So I started to read in the lab .
And I was saying , &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John Adams said &quot; &quot; John Adams : &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; David Adams . &quot; &quot; And I think about friends and the same part of my friends .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; : <unk> Graham &#93; &#91; Graham Bell , Warren Buffett and <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The Alice <unk> &#93; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) And I &apos;ve got a couple of postcards in the book : &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The power of the <unk> : &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
For Jesus , they were economic and political and political .
And it &apos;s interesting to say , these are all sorts of things : we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of our lives .
I &apos;m also interested in talking about two languages of language that you &apos;re talking about in language .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> Path &quot; &quot; : Thomas <unk> &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> : The water <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) Now , Alan Greenspan , I &apos;ve made a lot of interesting questions , but I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
For example , I had to deal with the people in English , which means &quot; &quot; fast <unk> &quot; &quot; in Chinese language .
The word &quot; &quot; Jeopardy &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; new basic &quot; &quot; in China . Yes !
( Laughter ) I think we &apos;ve got a lot of people who are able to connect with these people , and we can connect with people that we can connect with .
I don &apos;t know whether I was lonely or not lonely .
They &apos;re not going to be able to be able to get rid of other people &apos;s lives .
And I was thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not the only part of desire .
The main aim of our generation is that we need to make the sense that we can connect and find out that we can connect .
The desire is to do that .
It &apos;s because I &apos;m not going to go on this day , and I &apos;m not going to see a lot of time .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always going to die ! &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Now , if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not going to be able to see it , you &apos;re not going to be able to see that you &apos;re going to die , and you &apos;re not going to be able to see that you &apos;re not going to be able to sleep on your feet .
It &apos;s just going on .
That &apos;s what we need to talk about .
Today , to work today .
You can &apos;t see it . What do you do .
So I &apos;ve got to go on to go on and say , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t I talk to me ? &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m going to wake up on the beach , and then you &apos;re going to wake up . And then you &apos;re going to wake up .
( Laughter ) And so let &apos;s go back to you , and I &apos;m going to invite you to join you .
This is what I &apos;m going to do with you , you know , if you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of these two daughters , you know , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t have those two daughters , if you don &apos;t want to get those two daughters , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to get those two daughters back to you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , if you don &apos;t know how good people are going to make our decisions .
And I &apos;m not going to get a much more valuable than the office in office stations .
You can &apos;t believe it .
In fact , I believe that a lot of it is a new disease that is a new disease that is a new disease that was a new cause .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to get the <unk> . &quot; ( Laughter )
<unk> <unk> — beep , click , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) <unk> matter , right ?
You &apos;re not going to get rid of it every day .
And it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of things that go on the wrong side .
But , in the last few years , in the last few years , and the largest spread between the <unk> and the <unk> of the planet , and the largest spread between the <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> . ( Laughter ) And the reason why this man is not so good is that this man doesn &apos;t believe that this man is not going to be good at all .
And it turns out that there &apos;s a global climate crisis that is global .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
A few years ago , a video clip , and this is a video that you can have on this video .
This is a <unk> video that we hate to hate a video that we hate .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t want to control the future .
They don &apos;t know what they are doing .
And so I went on to go through the <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at it .
( Video ) <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And as a group of scientists , who would be a group of people , who don &apos;t know ?
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m not going to leave you today .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m sorry , Joe . I &apos;m sorry for you .
We need a lot of people who have to do , so that , you know , tell you that , let &apos;s make it all the way to make it all the way .
And as a group — ( Laughter ) — <unk> — ( Laughter ) <unk> , who <unk> ?
No ? Have me come back . ( Laughter )
Yes , you get to tell me .
A couple of weeks later , a couple of years later , 500,000 people , tens of years , tens of years , there were really many countries .
And three years later , this video takes a look at that video every month .
And if that &apos;s your mind , and the video is made by <unk> .
And I realized that I didn &apos;t think that I was able to find that way to find my life .
To find that useful and use to make it useful .
And I started with a fantasy , and I started with a lot of people who were able to get the <unk> , and they would be able to make sure that they would be happy .
In the middle of the middle class alone , in the middle of the middle class , you &apos;re not only in the middle class .

At first time , they don &apos;t stop .
Even if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know whether people are human beings .
It &apos;s one of the most simple tricks .
( Laughter ) Which is , if you don &apos;t know that , you don &apos;t have a whole thing to do .
We &apos;ve got the last letter that we &apos;ve got in our hands .
We need to realize that we can &apos;t believe that human beings don &apos;t believe that they can change our lives .
We need to figure out that if you &apos;re not going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re not going to be able to measure it .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot;
And before we met , and then the head of the head , and then the head of the head , and then asked me .
This is a scientific job that has been trained in scientific work , and it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of ways that people can help people feel better than they can make themselves feel better .
It could cause <unk> .

They &apos;re more likely to be able to get more and more <unk> than human beings .
You know , if you don &apos;t have a lot of calories with lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of new calories .
I didn &apos;t believe it . It was <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t believe that when we are <unk> , we can &apos;t agree that it &apos;s curiosity , curiosity , curiosity , science , <unk> science , <unk> science , <unk> science , <unk> science , <unk> science , <unk> science .
And in the last time I was in the middle of the past time , it was so many times in my life .
Some of them will tell us that they don &apos;t believe us .
But let &apos;s tell you that there &apos;s a lot of things in your life .
We need to change the capital of the Police Service , and we don &apos;t want them to do them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We want to try to change our ideas .
So I want to show you a little clip .
We can &apos;t do this . We &apos;ve got this for an experiment that NBC NBC .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The 1,600 of 1,600 of <unk> . &quot;
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to do this with 900 dollars in schools .
<unk> <unk> is a plastic thing that <unk> <unk> .
We need to use a lot of things to do with devices , but this is what we &apos;ve been hearing in college students .
( Laughter ) So it works like this : If you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do with it , you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t want to do it , you can &apos;t see it .
That &apos;s something .
So I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know . This is <unk> <unk> .
This is an experiment for the scientific community .
And I &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s the floor .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know . ( Laughter )
Of course , the question is , the question is , what do you find that this instrument doesn &apos;t do ?
And the answer is this : yes , you &apos;re not going to find out if you &apos;re hungry .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Not just don &apos;t just sit down , but you don &apos;t get it .
And if you don &apos;t tell you that you &apos;re going to give you a short note , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;ve always been able to use it .
People don &apos;t believe that if they don &apos;t get rid of their lives .
We &apos;re trying to measure everything that we can observe , and we are able to compare our ideas to our lives .
Here we did .
We took two <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and one of them is empty <unk> .
And 50 percent of the 50 percent have been successful . ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m not going to get rid of it .
This was an interesting example of what we &apos;ve done , a small example .
It &apos;s a little bit of three months old , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
This is the future for the future .
People don &apos;t get rid of it ?
I think I &apos;ve got some idea that I &apos;ve got some idea that I &apos;m not going to tell you , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying is , people don &apos;t care .
In every decade , average IQ is three numbers .
Very interesting .
<unk> or scientific things like a scientific thing .
<unk> and religion ?
This is like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These are two different ways .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to think about it .
It &apos;s the way that we &apos;re going to get rid of the whole world .
What would you say if you don &apos;t ask anyone to ask ? &quot; &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t want to go away , you can tell the story that you &apos;re going to be able to get away from another one , and you can tell , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; ?
And if someone called this &quot; &quot; Photoshop , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; Photoshop &quot; &quot; ?
And the question is , &quot; &quot; Well , the question is , is that it &apos;s more real than anything else .
Well , before we &apos;ve tried to find out to another world , we need to understand that we don &apos;t have this world .
Have you ever been able to help ? &quot; &quot; The World Cup News News ? &quot; &quot; The World Cup News News News ?
( Laughter ) Something like this : I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to get the Sydney dancer .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Then it &apos;s a great deal .
I think you &apos;re going to tell you that if you &apos;re going to tell the second story , &quot; &quot; This is the <unk> of all smart design .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
( Applause ) You can tell you that you &apos;re not going to get rid of your <unk> . But it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
It doesn &apos;t work .
For example , this is the end of the design for design design .
Now , if scientists don &apos;t think that scientists are sometimes the same as dark energy , dark matter , dark matter , known as dark matter .
This is what I &apos;m going to teach in science for science .
For example , this is the last slide that we can design for design .
But the same question is , the answer is , you know ?
You don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t want to get it ?
This is my <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You know , if you like , you know ? Because it &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t work .
No . &quot; &quot; Photoshop , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to go .
This is a kind of thing called Kodak <unk> .
They &apos;re ready to take care of their lives .
The camera was also ready .
( Laughter ) You can think of all of these things , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know it , you can &apos;t see it .
They &apos;re more common , they &apos;re always <unk> , and they &apos;re always going to be able to get rid of our lives .
For example , there was two problems that I could find in my life , for example .
First , I didn &apos;t hear anything about it .
Secondly , it was <unk> and <unk> , and so on , you can &apos;t understand that if you don &apos;t understand it .
And he wrote this kind of thing : &quot; The worst of the universe that you &apos;ve got on the top of the planet . &quot;
We don &apos;t know what it was .
So if you don &apos;t have a good job , you can &apos;t do that if you don &apos;t have a good deal with it , you don &apos;t have a good job .
This is what I &apos;m going to do with you .
This is a book that was able to deal with a book that was able to deal with the way that they could get the way that they could get the way that they were .
And these two things were known to be published , and there was a good argument about the solar system and the solar system , which is more precise than the surface of the solar system , and so on , that &apos;s how it exists faster .
We could also know that we can &apos;t see our buildings .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
The bad news is that you know it &apos;s full of science fiction .
And one of the things that we can see is that we have just had a sense of existence , and then I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m serious .
We &apos;ve been able to figure out that we can &apos;t see it .
This is <unk> <unk> .
In 1998 , when I was born in 1958 , I didn &apos;t know that the same place was going to be <unk> , and people would have thought that this would have been made by <unk> .
Here &apos;s a picture in the late 1990s .
You can do it with your friends , you can do it .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do , you can &apos;t get rid of it anymore .
And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you don &apos;t know , because it &apos;s evolved , because it &apos;s evolved and evolved .
It &apos;s really important for us to think about it .
And of course , I &apos;m not going to get rid of it . You can &apos;t see it .
Here you can see that you &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> .
( Laughter ) If you had a <unk> , you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t see it .
You can &apos;t see it . You &apos;ve seen it in the stratosphere ?
Or if you had an elephant elephant .
It doesn &apos;t bias .
( Laughter ) In 1998 , I didn &apos;t believe that when I was born .
He would take five dollars to see if he could get five dollars to see if he had to go to the floor , until it was the size of <unk> .
Here &apos;s the <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ?
We &apos;ve got this work that we can &apos;t see , because we &apos;ve got the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here I &apos;m not going to sit here on my shoulder . I &apos;m not going to see that I &apos;m not going to see that Las <unk> <unk> . Yes , I &apos;m going to get here .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve got 28 million dollars to get rid of this <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
And what do you know now ? You know ? ( Laughter )
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
To see this , I &apos;m sorry about it .
It was human beings .
With cars , I &apos;ve got a lot of people who don &apos;t know about cars .
We get closer .
That &apos;s what I call <unk> — that , and this is a great historian , two , two <unk> , two , two <unk> .
People have been trained thousands of people .
And I &apos;m going to go back to the end of the day , and I &apos;m not going to go back to the beginning .
You &apos;re going to find a picture in places where you &apos;re <unk> and <unk> .
This is a picture of the <unk> <unk> that I can &apos;t see .
Anyway , most of the buildings can be a wonderful .
( Laughter ) Now , if you really don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to be able to do it , you don &apos;t know ? ( Laughter )
It &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get another example from another example .
There &apos;s a film called &quot; &quot; The Internet , &quot; &quot; a movie &quot; &quot; <unk> sound , &quot; &quot; and we &apos;re going to talk about it .
You know , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the way that you &apos;re going , but you &apos;re not really big .
It &apos;s visible to us , you know .
It &apos;s hard to answer .
( Laughter ) This is the <unk> , these messages of electronics , these messages of electronics .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the best .
This was the word &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> words ) If there &apos;s a <unk> , I &apos;m feeling sorry .
May the summer to summer .
And if you don &apos;t have two ways , you &apos;ll be able to make the way that way .
Every day , you can see .
Now , I &apos;m not going to ask you to get the secret message that you can &apos;t see if you don &apos;t know ?
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause )
( Music ) What do you do with metaphorical words ? <unk> : Devil !
The Bible ? The smartest one is the winner .
Now , now you can see what you &apos;re talking about is what you &apos;re talking about , and you &apos;re not going to get it again .
( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) Now , you know what you &apos;re going to see , you know what it &apos;s like , you know what you see ? ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a little bit of small , fresh and <unk> stories .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t hear the kids who are hungry for people .
I have a pop class .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
We have a lot of <unk> .
It was between the best five songs in 2009 . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> million million rads of <unk> . &quot; &quot; Love is a lot of people who don &apos;t have the idea that they were <unk> , and they don &apos;t have a lot of attention to a million years ago .
There &apos;s a section here .
( Music ) ( Music ends ) It &apos;s about 12 billion light years old , and it doesn &apos;t tell you that it &apos;s right . No matter , I can tell you that this is true .
Announcer : Good . At least .
In America , it would be like , &quot; &quot; About six thousand light light-years away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Frank <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; wrote a &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; which is what we &apos;ve been talking about , and we know what we &apos;re talking about , we know what we &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s not 12 , it &apos;s not about 12 billion light years old , and it &apos;s not the case .
And if you have a little bit of small <unk> , you know how much it is .
So , if it isn &apos;t properly properly properly , you can see that it &apos;s very close to it .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; After all , I could tell him that after the interview , I would call him to call it , &quot; &quot; I was worried that I was very confident that I was very disappointed .
I was on the couch . He wrote a <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to do that .
( Music ) ( Music ends ) Now , if you don &apos;t think that the expansion of the universe is the speed of light .
You can have a share of your life , but this is the closest you can do .
And so on , we &apos;ve been able to get rid of our lives , and we &apos;ve always been able to do it with our partners .
( Laughter ) Right ?
( Applause )
In the 1960s , in the 1960s , when you have <unk> <unk> , you had to get it on the floor .
It was a <unk> that was written by a <unk> <unk> .
Now , the government knew the whole story of the government .
And if I could make a little bit of paper , I could find a piece of paper that I could find out of the closet .
And if you don &apos;t know , we &apos;ve had a rug that we had a rug , a <unk> , a <unk> .
I didn &apos;t let it go .
But in 2009 , in 2009 , the whole famous brand of a company , which is a number of people who have been able to put it on a laser . ( Laughter ) If you &apos;re not going to be able to put it in your pocket , you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of color that you can see , and that &apos;s where you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of color , which is that there &apos;s actually a number of yellow points automatically generated by you .
This is <unk> .
Nobody knows it .
This is a <unk> technology that we can &apos;t use in technology to use our technology .
This problem has three main online meetings .
And if you look at the literature , you can see that we &apos;re going to look at it , and then you can see that we &apos;re going to go online .
This is the three key elements of this puzzle .
First , online .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And online , it &apos;s not hard to understand if it &apos;s not hard to do .
These guys were saving money .
Many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many
Actually , online , <unk> <unk> , <unk> people .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is Alfred .
This is the Stephen watts .
This is <unk> .
This is Matthew and <unk> <unk> .
These guys are online online , but they do it in the way that they &apos;re going to use it , and they use it in the way that they &apos;re going to go online , and if we &apos;re going to use it online , they use some of these things , or if we don &apos;t want to make money online , or if we don &apos;t want to go , then I don &apos;t know if they &apos;re going to be able to get the rent online , if you &apos;re trying to get a <unk>
Two months ago , the U.S. , the U.S. , the U.S. &quot; &quot; Sam <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> million Americans .
Nobody knows what &apos;s going on .
And I think that this day , I think it &apos;s much bigger than the real world , which is more than the real world .
And it seems to be more likely to be able to say that you &apos;re even more likely to say that you &apos;re going to get the answer .
It &apos;s a <unk> online , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not why the second breakthrough that we could find is not a lot of money .
It &apos;s going to be the idea that it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to be an idea for me .
Anonymous , we &apos;ve been trained for the last year , and online , and online , I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s going to go .
Three of the questions : these are the things that are going to be able to make a lot of money in order to make this work , and that &apos;s the result of the third source , which is the result of the third source , which is the fact that governments and education .
So let &apos;s look at what we call <unk> .
This is the obvious amount of what I &apos;m trying to sneak on with our hands .
<unk> <unk> <unk> — more or more — it was .
The past year , online , went out on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Someone who &apos;s not trusting anybody to do the whole system .
And last week , I was asked about the governments in the world , asking for this question , what I &apos;d like to tell you about , why I asked people to think that the people who were worried that they would have been able to tell me that they would have been able to tell the people that they could possibly have .
He said .
How would people die like this ?
We need to go online online .
There are the <unk> lines .
What do they do ?
If you have an understanding of your mind , and if you want to use it , you need to be able to use your <unk> to use your ideas , and you don &apos;t want to use it .
We &apos;ve been able to use it to be able to use <unk> , or in other ways , in the poorer countries , which are more likely to be in the poorer countries , more than the country , more than the other people in the country , because they don &apos;t have a lot more than their foreign governments , because they don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be able to get the local government in this country .
But they don &apos;t think that they &apos;re going to call the outside of the outside .
It &apos;s possible to be able to get rid of it .
That was the end of the day .
How about the Arabic Spring and the way , how do you deal with ?
In fact , in 2011 , 2011 , 2011 , we &apos;ve had the secret to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Between this <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And in this case , I had a tendency to go through this mess , and I had a tendency to go through that , and I had a tendency to go through the stratosphere to make all of the connections that we could find in our lives .
This is our ability to get rid of our ability to get rid of it .
I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
It makes sure that the Western civilization takes place to make sure that the Western civilization takes place in its face .
But Western democracies also do this .
For example , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , I called the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the German German <unk> , which is made by a few weeks ago .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t see your phone .
Now , here we are .
The Internet is going on .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do , you know , you know , you know , online , you know , online , you know , online , you know .
Now , the number of people talking about this , the number of chances , is to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a good job , but I &apos;m not a good job , but I don &apos;t have a lot of effect .
Why am I worried ?
I don &apos;t know anything secret . &quot; &quot; But this is a very good idea .
They &apos;re <unk> .
Not <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t depend on the way that the security is between and the <unk> .
It depends on the way between and control .
And this is what we call <unk> , and this is what we call <unk> , and this is what we call <unk> .
But if we don &apos;t know about 50 years from the next 50 years , how do you <unk> your eye ?
And this is the question and the question that we &apos;re going to get in 50 years ahead of the questions .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you , thank you . &quot; &quot; Because I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
And this is the first step in Washington DC , and this is the first step in Washington , D.C.
My friends and my friends told me , I don &apos;t know .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to be here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying you &apos;re going to be here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to be here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to be here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to be here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine the behavior of 17 years old , and you can imagine the behavior of this kind of thing .
And my father said to me , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> . &quot; &quot; And my father said to me , &quot; &quot; This is the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And my father said to me , &quot; This is the <unk> . &quot;
We don &apos;t know , because we &apos;ve been able to find out , because they come from , where they came from .
When I was in 17 years old , I said , &quot; God , my God , who am my friend ? &quot;
And then I started to deal with that .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s what we call <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to take the <unk> of the <unk> .
And yet , this is what we &apos;ve never seen .
I &apos;d like to believe that I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to be able to make it work , and I &apos;d like to tell you about the story of my life .
In fact , in the 19th century , I &apos;ve seen two oil farms under the Golden Gate Bridge , where I &apos;ve seen two oil farms in the Golden Gate Bridge .
And I decided that I was so proud that I was able to use my <unk> <unk> .
This is a big thing for California .
This is also a big thing to be able to find out if I was living in <unk> , which was a big thing to do with the <unk> of the year , where there was only 350 people in the middle of the day .
And I started to get here in my apartment , people — what I thought was — what I thought was — what I thought was ...
They said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do with you ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re not going to do that . You &apos;re not going to do that .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make us feel bad for you . &quot; &quot; Maybe they were laughing , and I thought , people don &apos;t believe me , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
Because I don &apos;t know , because we don &apos;t know that everyone &apos;s going to die .
And I &apos;m not talking about the people who are connected to the people who are connected .
And I put it in the box .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to use it , &quot; &quot; and my father said , &quot; &quot; Why are you going to do this with 16-year-old age ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about the race between the past ?
They &apos;re in Philadelphia .
I said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t know how much of it is , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t need it , you don &apos;t need to do this . &quot;
So , I decided to have my niece <unk> , which is — I decided I had a lot of <unk> and very <unk> — I decided to say , &quot; &quot; I want a daily life .
So I did this .
And in the morning , I was in the middle of the morning .
And I mean , this is a wonderful experience for me , because I began to find that I was like this .
And he decided to think about me .
Because I always realized that I was always worried that people want to talk about people , and when they talk to people , they want to talk about what they want to talk about .
And people talk about them , and they talk about them , and they talk about what they &apos;re talking about .
And then ...
And so many of them will end up with the end of the connection to communicate .
And that day , I was really worried about that .
And that &apos;s because I &apos;ve been trained because I realized that I didn &apos;t know anything .
I was 27 years old , and I thought , I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So in order to do this next day , then again , and then , again , and this time , I &apos;ve talked about it , because I &apos;m going to spend a year on my journey , because I &apos;ve got a lot of work , and I needed it .
So , a year ago , I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to talk about some of the things that I &apos;m going to tell you about . &quot; &quot; So I thought , maybe I don &apos;t want to speak again .
But , this was 17 years ago .
And I &apos;ve also been involved in trying to find myself in this 17 years , and I was also trying to find myself on my blog , and I was also trying to find myself in my book that I was trying to learn to learn from my books .
And I thought , well , I need education .
And I went to Oregon , in Oregon , where we went to the side of the side of the environment .
It &apos;s 800 miles away .
And what did I go from ? &quot; &quot; What ?
We don &apos;t believe that if you &apos;re not going to get it .
Ah , what do you want to read here ?
<unk> ...
You have a special advantage for you .
And in two years , I &apos;ve just finished the rate of <unk> .
My father came . He came to me with me .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t believe that we &apos;re going to fight our lives , but we don &apos;t know how to do that .
You know , if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to be able to get these things , you know , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not going to be able to rely on <unk> , and I &apos;m going to try and reconnect . &quot;
And I went to Washington , D.C. , D.C. , where I came back to Washington , D.C. , where I was in the middle of my hometown , from Idaho to Washington , D.C. , to Washington , D.C.
And two years ago , in Montana , in Montana , in Montana , and I &apos;ve been able to spend two years in the nonprofit sector , and I didn &apos;t believe that in Montana .
Two years here would be bad news .
( Laughter ) And so , I &apos;ve got two years of education . I &apos;ve been trained in two years .
There are two stories in Montana .
That &apos;s the first thing that I &apos;ve experienced when I opened it up .
And they said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be worried about this , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back in the morning . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to give a lecture .
Do you go to South Africa , you know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , South America .
So I did this .
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Okay , John , John , who &apos;s a wish for a lecture for a lecture is a <unk> office in my hometown , and you can use it as a student , and you can use it .
And so I &apos;m hoping that all of you may not let me go back to the supermarket , which is that all of our dreams have been allowed to take place .
But if you don &apos;t want to use it to be easier , and you don &apos;t know whether they &apos;re going to solve the problem , and then you can &apos;t afford it . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
I had to help them to help me .
I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s a lot of ways that we can control the environment , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with you .
That &apos;s how we spend time , not because of it .
I was 13 years old , 13 years old .
And my friend <unk> : my friend John <unk> : The name of my name is John Francis , who is the name of John <unk> , who said , &quot; &quot; John <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the last generation .
You know , you &apos;re not going to see that .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to know if I was going to die for a baby .
But he didn &apos;t know that he was at all .
After two months , everybody worked on our <unk> .
And I learned a lot about this and I learned a lot about this .
And if you don &apos;t know how to go back , John , I don &apos;t know what I think — I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , that &apos;s the tree of the tree .
No , no . That &apos;s not — it &apos;s not — it &apos;s not — it &apos;s not .
Do I want to do with you .
You can do it .
No , no matter what he heard .
So this is the debate that we &apos;ve been talking about .
I &apos;m going to go back to this audience and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
But there was something I learned to learn , and sometimes they had a sense of what I mean , and I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I do .
And I thought , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not really good .
So I kept working .
My father came to me when I was in my father , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know what we do . We don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re not going to wake up . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about .
What do you want to do with your colleagues ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to go back to Wisconsin . &quot; &quot; I went back to Wisconsin .
I mean , you know , two years ago , there was two years out there .
Nobody knows that oil is going on .
But it did something — Exxon Valdez .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not the only guy who &apos;s talking about oil .
And my father came .
He said , &quot; &quot; My son can &apos;t understand how it &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t use it .
He said , &quot; &quot; You need to tell you that you can &apos;t tell you , because , you know , you &apos;re going to make it a better job , because you &apos;re going to get it out of your mouth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I had to go back .
And I had to take the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the Atlantic Ocean , the <unk> of the Atlantic Ocean .
And I began to find out that I could not see that I could live on the floor of my hometown , and I was able to train my life .
And so , in fact , if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to get rid of it , it &apos;s because it &apos;s a man who &apos;s not going to get rid of it , but it &apos;s not the sound that you &apos;re talking about .
And I had to thank you , because , I &apos;m sorry , they don &apos;t know me , because they don &apos;t know me .
And that &apos;s what we can do .
And they &apos;re not going to talk to me about my story — they tell me that they didn &apos;t get me .
And that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like — you know , you &apos;re not going to see .
And really , really important — we need to be able to get rid of it .
I went on .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not going to do that .
You can &apos;t see the Coast Coast of the Coast River .
We need the rules for the United States — in the middle of the world , in the middle of oil .
20 years ago , if someone told me , &quot; John , John , if you want to do a <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I want to go . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and say , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Man : You know , you want to go .
What if that &apos;s what happens ? How ?
How do you want to be able to make a simple amount of simple precision ?
The Coast Coast of the Coast River .
And after that — I said , there was only a year in this — I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not just a year ago , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go on this job . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to go on this . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
The key question is — I want to tell you why I &apos;m going to tell you why I &apos;m going to talk to you .
I started talking to the story , and I started talking to the other of our minds .
Now , in this context , we had the ability to control the environment — that we need to be able to control our society .
And I had to tell you — people were talking about people , and we don &apos;t know what , and we don &apos;t know .
And we don &apos;t want to tell each other , but we don &apos;t want to tell each other , but we don &apos;t want to tell each other , we don &apos;t see each other .
And if we &apos;re thinking about our environment , we &apos;re looking at our minds , and we &apos;re looking at each other with each other , and we &apos;re seeing each other .
And that was the equivalent of the equivalent I wanted to be .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go on this blog , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to sit on my shoulder , and I was on my face , and I was on his face , and I was on his face , and I was on my face , and I went on .
This is the story of the story , and I realized that I &apos;m not going to get there anymore .
And I had the <unk> — I &apos;ve known it , and I had a <unk> prison , and I didn &apos;t know what happened to me — I didn &apos;t know what I was talking to me because I didn &apos;t know anything .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; You know ?
I don &apos;t have to show you what I had to do with you .
I was in the U.N. — a doctor and I went around the world and I left the world .
What did he do with this ?
And the way we insist on the road came back .
I didn &apos;t know .
So what am I saying thank God I &apos;m listening to my God and God ?
And then I went to 150 miles away after I went on , and I realized that I was not going to live 150 miles away .
I was in my apartment , and I was on the floor .
I used to use my <unk> <unk> <unk> .
How do you get ?
Because I &apos;ve been able to use it as quickly as I started to use my devices .
But the difference is that , I think every one of you , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not sure I &apos;ve been able to use it .
I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m going to be able to get rid of the GMT .
The professor <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so I realized that I just had other other stories , and I &apos;m not just thinking about that .
You know , we can do that .
I had to change myself .
And I don &apos;t know , because I &apos;m always going to tell you , because I &apos;m always going to tell you that I &apos;m always going to come back .
Because , you know , I &apos;m not going to go to jail .
I didn &apos;t know who I was .
But I didn &apos;t know that it &apos;s required .
I didn &apos;t know , because this is the only way that we &apos;re going to live here today .
And I know that when we always want to stay alive , we always need to live in other places .
And we &apos;re not going to see that we &apos;re going to have a new generation that we have already had to go to where we &apos;re going .
And I &apos;d like to ask for the next place to go to the next place — where you can see , where you can see that you &apos;re going to be able to get your hands out of your hands , which is to go to where you are , and that &apos;s where we &apos;ve got to know .
We are now .
We &apos;ve got to say that we need to talk about the past .
And if I tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you that if I &apos;m not going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you what I am here , if I &apos;m here .
I know that I know that I &apos;m going to tell you , you can &apos;t see me .
Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t know — this is what you &apos;re going to do with the world , if you &apos;re not going to get this <unk> — you &apos;re not going to get to the world where you &apos;re going to tell each other at TED .
Because it &apos;s because of our collective environment and our collective sense of communication , which means that we can connect our emotions with our environment .
So I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m going to show you about five minutes old .
Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
You know , if you want to tell you that every single one of you is in America , you &apos;re going to ask you , &quot; You know , if you &apos;re a member of the United States , this is the name of <unk> ? &quot;
And what you &apos;re saying is , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about .
This is the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , why is that ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , why is that ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to name it .
They have names of names , blocks , just <unk> to <unk> , &quot; &quot; that , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get a little bit of fun , you don &apos;t know .
Now let &apos;s imagine that if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re not going to tell the man that you &apos;re saying , &quot; You don &apos;t believe that ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This is the block of block and <unk> , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s the name here ? &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have the names of the name name . &quot;
They have names of names .
Look at Google <unk> . There are 14 , 15 , 18 , 18 , 18 , 18 , 18 , 18 .
All these <unk> names have names , which are between the blocks .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well , why are you going to make your home ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; You know , how much is you ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
And this is the block of the block of the blockchain , a <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to go on a house , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , they &apos;re going to go . &quot; &quot; They say , &quot; &quot; Of course , they &apos;re going to go .
The first home we &apos;re going to get rid of the first home of the pyramid .
After that , I was able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> . It &apos;s clear . It &apos;s clear . &quot; &quot; Sometimes I have a lot of fun to see if we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not going to be able to see it , that we &apos;re never going to be able to see that we &apos;re not going to be able to see it .
For example , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do with your life , you need to make your work .
And in the months you &apos;re going to spend a lot of money in the months , and if you don &apos;t have any money , because they don &apos;t have any money , because they can &apos;t do that if they can &apos;t make their own decisions , and they don &apos;t believe that if they &apos;re sick .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) We &apos;re not going to take a &quot; &quot; eureka . &quot; &quot; One , two , three .
But in the <unk> Africa , Africa is a piece of &quot; &quot; a piece of music , &quot; &quot; which is the end of a physicist .
So , it &apos;s not just that we don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t like it , but two , three , four , one .
And that map is true .
( Laughter ) There is this phrase that I have to tell you about India , which is true of what &apos;s flat .
So , if you don &apos;t know , if you have a great deal , or maybe in other places or elsewhere , you can see that it can be true .
<unk> <unk> . ( Applause )
