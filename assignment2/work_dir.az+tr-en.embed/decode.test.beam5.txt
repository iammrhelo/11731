Today I &apos;m going to tell you about an unexpected story .
And I now have the solar system industry .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you , and we &apos;re going to be able to make sure that we &apos;re going to make it small .
So , let &apos;s look at the different aspects of this .
This is a little bit about what we &apos;ve done .
Oh , wait a minute .
It &apos;s a little bit wrong .
( Laughter ) We just — this is — I &apos;m not — ( Laughter ) — this is just — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — this is just — ( Laughter ) .
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) ( Applause )
Okay . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s the sun .
Oh , if you don &apos;t know ?
Okay . Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want to focus on what I &apos;m talking about .
And then a few years later , I &apos;m going to tell you that if you &apos;re a little bit more likely to be able to do it , then you can make it very important that if you &apos;re a little bit more likely to be able to do it .
We &apos;ve been very careful with language , especially when we &apos;re concerned about the language of others .
Most of the different aspects of the world : ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not going to be able to make a sense of life , and you &apos;re feeling very simple , and it &apos;s a simple thing as simple as you can .
TG : That &apos;s where they go from 10 to 10 years .
This was the lucky officer in the United States of America .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m worried about — no . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We don &apos;t know . We can &apos;t trust ourselves .
They &apos;re not .
You &apos;re not going to be able to be invisible for the man .
As you can see , there are people , and people have the same things .
And it turns out that this is what we call <unk> and <unk> .
By the time , when I was in my life , we often don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be afraid .
I mean , if someone is on us , you &apos;re not going to be able to put it on the power of the power , and it &apos;s not the way that we &apos;re going to make it .
And in contrast , we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it .
Have you ever wondered what ?
And I found that when I was an MBA in the MBA of the MBA with a lot of atomic power .
You know , when you &apos;re a leader who can &apos;t cooperate , in class , in class , we &apos;re not going to go into the middle of the supermarket , where there &apos;s still a number of kids who are trained in a straight room .
It &apos;s almost almost like two of these things .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re being invisible .
They &apos;re like sitting in the middle , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
It &apos;s a few things for myself .
The first is you can &apos;t .
And it turns out that it depends on that .
So the women who are older than they are , they become more than they are .
They feel more vulnerable than women , and they don &apos;t care about it .
It &apos;s also out of the <unk> .
And this is very important to be an MBA , because it makes them feel that they &apos;re not going to be able to make the rest of their lives .
We &apos;ve always been fighting the courage to fight our lives .
The people who are able to contribute to the same level , and the women who are at the end of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course .
I started to think about my parents , which is that we can &apos;t get rid of our lives in this way .
And if these videos were going to be able to take these videos , if they could do this kind of thing , they can &apos;t afford to take care of their lives ?
He was not going to be able to be able to get a lot of <unk> .
So , if you haven &apos;t empowered to make sure that you &apos;ve got a strong advantage , you can make it feel stronger if you could make it feel stronger ?
Now , we know that the sense of perception and recognition is about our ideas and our ideas about our ideas .
But the question is , the question of the question is , I &apos;m not worried about it , and I &apos;ve been able to do it .
But we also need to get rid of our lives in this way , and we also need to get rid of it .
So this is all two different times .
They also also have the courage to go .
We need to think about ourselves as powerful , and we tend to tend to think that we need more power to make sure that we have more power to be able to make sure that you feel powerful and so powerful .
You know , we don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it , but you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
The sense of perception , the way I think , is that I &apos;m not talking about my ideas .
And the idea of the idea is that I don &apos;t know how to make them laugh , and I can &apos;t see them , and I can &apos;t tell me , I &apos;m not sure . I don &apos;t know .
What do I think we can &apos;t solve ?
It doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s powerful people .
They &apos;re going to tell them , &quot; &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t like that . &quot; &quot; You know .
And we offer them an opportunity to offer them that we don &apos;t want to take care of them .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to play a video game .
This is about 60 percent of the population , and that &apos;s as important as well .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I &apos;m going to ask for the moment that we &apos;ve got 20 percent of our kids , 20 percent of the world &apos;s population of 20 percent of the world &apos;s population , which is 10 percent of our lives .
The two transformations have become these changes .
Here &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re left .
We &apos;ve got 25 percent of our kids who are going to get rid of their lives , and they &apos;re not going to increase the size of 15 percent of our lives .
At two minutes , I think that our brains are more ambitious , and we need to feel more ambitious , and more comfortable , and we need to feel more ambitious .
This is <unk> <unk> , right ?
So I think about how we think about our language , our language , our language , and you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s not just for them to do .
You need to change other than that .
And the next question you can see is that you can actually change the amount of energy that you can see when you &apos;re not able to change the power of a few decades .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
How do you apply that in real life ?
Of course , that &apos;s the essence of us .
It can be used to be used to use these ideas from the social <unk> that we can create .
Where are you going to see ?
This is a picture of the <unk> desk .
For some of them , that &apos;s the schools .
They &apos;re not going to take care of them , or they don &apos;t work in this way .
And they don &apos;t believe that if they don &apos;t have a job , because they don &apos;t have a job , because they don &apos;t get it .
So we &apos;ve been able to reconstruct the <unk> , <unk> them , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to say , &quot; How do we do that ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Of course , this idea is in denial . No . No . No . No .
You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing !
It &apos;s not about you .
That &apos;s what we want to do .
What do you do when you get older ?
You sit on it . You &apos;re not going to be able to sleep , and you can &apos;t hear it .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it , you know , that &apos;s what you need to do . You know what you &apos;re going to do . You &apos;re going to sit on the couch . You &apos;re going to sit at the table .
This was what we wanted .
And then I was able to find a lot of work that I could reconnect with , and then I had a lot of work with a lot of work , and then I had a lot of work with a lot of work .
You &apos;ve got a video video on five minutes .
They were able to use them to do what they could do , to make sure that they could be able to use them to do what they could do , to make sure that they could do it .
For five minutes , we &apos;ve never been able to get rid of that way to look forward .
Nobody knows that .
We call this &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; This is what happens when you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to get rid of it .
You can &apos;t get them to see if you can &apos;t see them .
And then we &apos;re going to get four of those dives in the lab .
They had <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They had <unk> what they were doing , and then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to take these things work . &quot; &quot; And then we need to get rid of those who have a lot of power , you know .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to get it out .
And then I &apos;m going to get rid of it . &quot; &quot; What do you do with this ?
That &apos;s not why they &apos;re not .
It depends on their <unk> .
And if you look at the other side of the other side , like , what do you do with your life ?
Have you ever got it ?
This was no matter whatsoever .
The key thing is that it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s happening .
People are not alone in real time .
So they don &apos;t care about themselves .
They &apos;re never going to be able to do it .
It makes the difference that it &apos;s happening .
And so I ask people , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you can change your mind , and you can change your memory , and say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not a little smile ? &quot;
And I &apos;m going to tell you that as much as I can get older .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
You don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t hear any of you .
You &apos;re not going to be able to get it .
They don &apos;t want to be anywhere .
I &apos;m very good at doing these words very well . I &apos;m going to tell you a little story about it , and I want to tell you a little story about it .
When I was 19 , I was 19 years old , very <unk> .
They &apos;re going to go out of the room .
It &apos;s a few years old .
I didn &apos;t know that I was going to be able to leave my hands on my shoulder , and I had to go on my couch , and the news was that I was going down in the morning , and it was very painful for me . It was very painful for me .
I didn &apos;t believe that because I was smart , because I don &apos;t think they &apos;re smart , and I don &apos;t know .
To give you a <unk> , I wanted to go back .
They said to me : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , but you don &apos;t believe that you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to fight it . I &apos;m going to fight it , so I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to have . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t tell me , you don &apos;t know anything about it .
I felt a lot in my life .
I didn &apos;t believe that , I was obsessed with my parents , and I couldn &apos;t care about it .
I &apos;ve just finished on my couch .
I had to spend four years on my journey , and I had to spend a lot of time with the Susan <unk> , and I was obsessed with the Susan <unk> , and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know .
And 20 years old , 20 years old , I was 20 years old .
It was night .
And I &apos;d like to say that when I was in the morning , I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to call it the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to see you . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do .
We need to know that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to see it .
And if you don &apos;t know .
You &apos;re not going to have all the <unk> you are .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s been taken over you , it &apos;s been taken off . You don &apos;t believe it !
I mean , I don &apos;t really know , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I did .
You &apos;ve got to spend five years in high school for five years , and a couple of years ago , I <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I think it &apos;s not my place .
At the end of the first year , in the end of the day , I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go to college . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to go on the beach , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to live . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a good golfer .
And he said , &quot; &quot; This is not my place for me . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; This is not my place . &quot;
This became my daughter for me .
Because two things happened .
The first thing I realized was that I had to deal with it .
But he felt , and he was a friend of mine .
And second , he had to find her right place .
So , he could make a <unk> .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I &apos;m going to go here !
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , you &apos;re going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be able to put it in class , you &apos;re going to tell you that I &apos;ve been in class , &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go in class . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it did . <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A few months later , he came up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen
He was hungry .
So I &apos;d like to tell you , I would like to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , I want to tell you , &quot; I want to tell you , I want to tell you
Follow the matter .
I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that as much as one of the things I &apos;d ever imagined .
We can &apos;t believe it .
You can see that there &apos;s a huge amount of <unk> .
Now , that &apos;s two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
The next time you &apos;ve got time , you &apos;ve got two titles , you &apos;ll try to do this . You &apos;re going to try to do this . You don &apos;t get the cockroaches , you &apos;re wearing the table , and you don &apos;t see it .
Help me go .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that the best thing I &apos;ve ever met .
You &apos;re not going to get rid of it . You don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , I didn &apos;t show them what I &apos;m going to tell them , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to show them what I &apos;m saying .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know who I am . I &apos;m going to show them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to show them . &quot;
I want to put it in my hands on this force , and I &apos;m also going to tell you about it , because it &apos;s very <unk> .
This is not the <unk> . ( Laughter ) This is the <unk> , and I &apos;m not going to ask people to deal with people , because people can tell people about what they &apos;re doing , and they are people who are not talking about technology .
We can &apos;t do it with them , we can &apos;t use it .
Because it &apos;s because of the <unk> , the amount of attention I can &apos;t get to spend two of the things that they can &apos;t do .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have a lot in the world .
It &apos;s the most important one in between them .
It &apos;s kind of like , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to find that you &apos;re going to be able to live in a way that you &apos;re not going to get to know .
They came up with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not going to be able to make sure that all of the transactions can benefit from all of our minds , and they don &apos;t really appreciate them .
Here , in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 90 percent — they &apos;re <unk> .
Most of them work on their bodies . They &apos;re going to be able to get rid of our lives .
I was able to tell you about a few years ago when I was a couple of years old , and I was able to tell you that I could live on my blog and talk to my parents and <unk> .
And this is the reason why this is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to be able to find out .
In 1998 , I translated my attention to my office as I &apos;ve been working on my job when I was born in 1958 .
But this time you can get rid of it .
The art of art and <unk> were more attention , and this was a lot of attention , and they helped them grow the amount of attention .
This day , they &apos;re not going to be able to go and start with social change .
We need to know that this world is always happening in this world since this world has been on this planet .
I was invited to spend many cities in a lot of cities , and I was invited around the world and a lot of <unk> .
And I came out of my mind that I didn &apos;t want to sit on my shoulder .
I &apos;m not going to tell them , I think , in Africa , South Africa , South Africa , in Africa , in Africa , in South Africa .
And I realized that there was a lot of people who were more people , because it was great .
And then after that , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) This is a <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I was a believer in the <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the purpose of the community , and the purpose of the community , was a huge <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It was also <unk> by <unk> <unk> , which is also the security of the security , the security of the security , the security of the security , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to tell you about the other side : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And finally , this is a great deal of big , big , big , big , big , big <unk> .
This is the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in Rio de Janeiro and <unk> <unk> .
But we &apos;ve created the <unk> of TEDx , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , we don &apos;t care about everyone .
In two years , 3,000 volunteers , 800 volunteers , 200 volunteers and 200 <unk> , and they were <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and we &apos;ve been able to get rid of the commons .
No matter what I &apos;m talking about is the honor and honor of people who are being trained and willing to express .
You can &apos;t see that if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t see that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of your mind , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to sleep .
Now , now you &apos;re going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to find those invisible protocells , and you &apos;re not going to see them .
Try to see the whole thing as a whole thing , without the <unk> .
If you don &apos;t know it , you have more than 20 million people around the world .
And I could tell him that when I was a part of that time , I couldn &apos;t find one part of my way to see them .
<unk> , thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
I was five years old , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> <unk> , but I &apos;d like to tell you about a few months ago in New York City , where I was in the middle of New York , in New York City : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> plans .
<unk> plans by <unk> plans by <unk> plans .
But in fact , in the 1900s , the Earth was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
I &apos;m not going to get rid of it .
In 2009 , Pennsylvania , Pennsylvania , when I was born , I was able to see that in my village , I was able to look at the world in class , and I &apos;d look at the world in class , and I &apos;m not going to ask me to go to the world .
And when I was on my age , he started to <unk> <unk> .
And my father made me go back to the side of the side of Islam , a lot of people who were very few people .
And I &apos;ve learned about these things that I &apos;ve learned : people who have been trained enough to make sure that every one of us will be able to understand that each of each of us is the same as usual .
Every single nation , every single nation , every single nation , every single nation , is able to tell people that we can tell each other , but we need to tell people that we can do it .
And a few months ago , my father told me that my father had a couple of weeks before my father came back with a couple of weeks before my father came to London .
And then , in the morning , I &apos;m not going to meet him .
We didn &apos;t even know that if we don &apos;t get the <unk> , we didn &apos;t know that it was hidden in the world .
My father helped me tell me that my father would help me to tell me that my father was going to help me , and how I got 30 years old .
Now , this is a little bit of light on the end of the last week of the last week , which was the result of a small orange tree , and I didn &apos;t know how to do it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know . &quot;
Now , if you don &apos;t know , this is all fun , but in a few years after a few years later , I realized that I could actually find that .
They don &apos;t believe that when they &apos;re <unk> , they don &apos;t believe that they are <unk> .
These are people who have been 700 pounds of light out of the world , and they can &apos;t tell us that if you &apos;re not going to see the Earth &apos;s Earth , you can &apos;t see that there are six pounds of light that you can &apos;t see in the world , and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t know that many people don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to be able to make sure that they don &apos;t matter .
These people don &apos;t want to find myself .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the people I call <unk> .
As 19 years old , 20 years old , I had no idea that my friends had become less likely to be able to find out to my friends and my friends .
I would feel like I would feel like I would feel like I would feel like I would feel like I &apos;d ever imagined .
Every time you &apos;re always a new person , like , you know , I &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re going to get married .
In fact , in the middle of the stadium , I was able to train my class in class , but it became clear that the only thing happened , which was that my new life was to be able to do it .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m reading a lot of people read a book , and I &apos;m not going to play the game and play games .
And so I had the ability to communicate that social communication that we have in social media like one of my friends , and I had no access to the real amount of life .
I grew up in a way that people can &apos;t understand , like religion and religion and religion .
What has happened to you ?
This kind of thing came up to me when I thought about this kind of idea that I had to think about this kind of idea that I was in the middle of the year 2000 .
We &apos;ve got a set of opportunities to take a <unk> program to take the <unk> of the National Geographic program .
As I was in the middle of my class , I was in the middle of my life , and I was sitting in a lot of other people , like one of the people who came up with a lot of people , and I had a lot of other people who were sitting in my life .
It was the people who lived in different ways of life .
I learned that one of my stories was a prison in which one of my daughters had been married .
And I realized that I was a few years old , and I realized that we weren &apos;t going to be able to be able to live between each other .
And before I was a friend of mine , my friend of mine , my friend <unk> , and my mother , I had to tell you that when I was born , I would love to feel the sense that I could find myself in my life .
But if I had a more important return , I could find that I could find a little bit of fun for some of the things I could find in my pocket .
Here I was in a variety of different ways , and this is the kind of experience that people have experienced in the world , and this experience played the basic role of experience .
It was the fact that there was a huge amount of information that we could find , and that was the fact that we need to have all the possibilities that all of our bodies have experienced .
I &apos;ve got a job that I &apos;ve been trying to spend in the middle of the class , and I &apos;ve been trying to spend a lot of people who are at least known as I &apos;ve been talking about , by the way , in a way that I &apos;ve never seen as much as I &apos;ve ever seen .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that when I was a teenager , I thought I was a little bit more like a person who was sitting in my closet , and I was a little bit more like a friend of mine , and I decided to tell you a story that was a stranger , a stranger , a stranger .
This is what I &apos;m going to tell you about , with the fact that you &apos;re going to make the difference between the real life and the real life of real life .
We don &apos;t know how to take care of it , but it &apos;s very good for what we &apos;ve been able to do with it , but because of what we don &apos;t know about it , it &apos;s very good for it .
And then then , &quot; &quot; The Graduate Show . &quot; &quot; And I had to tell you , &quot; &quot; The Graduate Show . &quot; &quot; And I had to tell you that I had to be honest about the story of the people , religious beliefs , religious beliefs , religious beliefs , religious beliefs , religious beliefs .
I &apos;m a believer in some of the moments that I &apos;ve heard about , in the moments that I &apos;ve heard about , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell me that I &apos;m not going to give me .
I had a lot of time when I was inspired by the fact that my inspiration was the way I had ever talked about the world more than the fact that I had never seen the world more than ever before the world .
On one day , I was talking about the world that I was talking about , and my mother had a conversation about the world , and my mother would tell me that I could live my lifetime .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve had enough time in life , you can tell me , &quot; You don &apos;t hate people to hate them . &quot;
And I realized that when I had a sense of hatred , I realized that when I had a sense of suffering from hatred .
It &apos;s not really the real step in my life .
And when we decided to start to start with a new house , we didn &apos;t know that when we decided to start a new house .
And why don &apos;t I put it in it ?
They &apos;re very <unk> .
This is what I &apos;m saying to you , maybe , maybe someone else , and that &apos;s what I think I &apos;m talking about , and I &apos;ve been able to tell you that if someone else is more comfortable with me , I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
We need to be able to use our lives as a result of our lives , our fears and our fears of our lives .
I don &apos;t know that if you &apos;re going to do that , and I &apos;m not going to tell them , I don &apos;t care about the fact that they &apos;re suffering from the grave and prejudice .
I &apos;m going to go ahead and see if I had this kind of conversation with my father , and I &apos;m going to go on my shoulder to try to make this kind of thing .
And as simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as simple as I could , I was living in a living way , and the way that we don &apos;t want to go on the road .
I &apos;m not like my father .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s a lot of crap !
<unk> ?
They don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going on on a line , but I wanted you to do it .
Boy : Who did it ? Anybody ? No problem .
For a while ago , I was in the restaurant , and I was on the floor of cooking .
I said , &quot; &quot; Do you have your hair ? &quot;
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t tell me .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you call it ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; What do you call it ? &quot; &quot; I know . &quot; &quot; I know . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! No ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; ( JAWS said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to wake up ?
He said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing with it ! &quot;
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to ask you to do it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; If this is the best girl in the world , I &apos;m not going to go up . &quot;
What do you mean , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; what do you mean if you don &apos;t know ?
And so I said , &quot; &quot; The young boy , the young boy , who are the young boy , did the <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
You know , how do you have this kind ?
Now , I started thinking .
This is me .
This man was really <unk> !
They don &apos;t want to tell me that they &apos;re not going to be able to tell our stories .
How do you respond to another ?
How do we get here ?
But there &apos;s a lot of people here who are there , and I &apos;ve got a lot of people who have to deal with them , and they &apos;re not going to be able to make sure that they &apos;re not going to do anything that they want to know .
I &apos;m all <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ?
It could have been the best flute players in our lives .
Everything I learned in Arabic is just a <unk> .
Do you want to be one of them ?
What are you going to do here ?
Despite all of that , I wanted to deal with it .
I didn &apos;t want it to be able to do it .
Arabic language is the answer to this day .
It &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re not talking about the language that we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re not talking about the way that we &apos;re going to make the work that we &apos;re going to be able to put in our cities in our cities .
If you don &apos;t know , they &apos;re not going to be able to make it .
So what I &apos;ve been able to use ? &quot; &quot; What do we all do ?
You know , we need to use Arabic language .
This is a <unk> .
But there is another one more important reality that we have .
Arabic is a central language .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a perfect word in the English language .
We need to get rid of other words in Arabic that we can do with other words .
How ?
It was the first time when I was writing the first time when I was trained in Arabic .
His whole idea is that I can &apos;t make the whole idea of a special repertoire , which is a special sense that I could make all of the ideas that were specific and specific to our own ideas .
So , when I started to write in English , he had to be enough .
And in fact , in English , in English , you know , when you read the text , you can &apos;t feel that you can feel that you can feel .
You can imagine , you know , in English , you know , in English , you &apos;re going to get rid of it .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
Secondly , it &apos;s often called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the only way that you can &apos;t read the word , the only way that you can &apos;t get the language of the <unk> .
This is a <unk> that I &apos;ve developed .
The Germans , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And so they don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to make it .
They can &apos;t do that .
And so they can use a lot of money to develop their language , to develop language , to develop language .
We know more about them ?
Well , we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not sure that we &apos;re not going to grow up in the world , we &apos;re not going to tell us that our ideas are still going to come from us .
It &apos;s a time when we &apos;re thinking about it , but we don &apos;t know that if you &apos;re not going to be able to do it , but if you don &apos;t want to do that , you don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be able to live in the world , and you &apos;re not going to be able to do it like that .
They don &apos;t want language to do .
Because if you don &apos;t know , if you &apos;re a product or a other side , it &apos;s a product of a product , and it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not domestic , but it &apos;s not domestic .
You can &apos;t believe that it &apos;s a local product .
They are <unk> <unk> , as we &apos;ve been talking about before , as we &apos;re talking about before .
So they became the <unk> for innovation , to make the innovation .
If I was saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Have you ever heard what , flat ?
Who is , and why .
Language isn &apos;t just the way that language is not just for a conversation .
Language is specific to our senses , and our brains are connected to our brains .
So , we &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; which has a private history of all of you can have special history .
Language is not going to be two or three or three or three options .
He was like , how do we get to know how to get our brains , how to make us feel overwhelmed .
What &apos;s your mind ?
How can you deal with this human , or not ?
So if I tell you , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying , &quot; Dad , you know ? &quot;
What do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t think about the problem , it &apos;s good , and it &apos;s not going to be empty .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you , which is a special thing that makes us special .
I have a friend who &apos;s married , married , married .
And I asked him , &quot; &quot; How do we do things ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , everything is good . &quot; &quot; But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not good enough . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) <unk> women , and then said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then all of the <unk> said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and then all of the <unk> answers .
And he said , &quot; &quot; How can you possibly be a human ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; How can you possibly have this ? &quot;
Who wants suicide ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> me ? &quot; &quot; ) This is one of our adventures .
So we started thinking about it , because I didn &apos;t deal with the fact that women would tell him that she would tell him that she would tell him that she would tell him that I could tell him that I could tell her .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , he said to me , &quot; &quot; He said to me , &quot; &quot; He said to me , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know when I &apos;m going to die . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you the word for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what it &apos;s like : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to
Help me do this .
( Applause ) What do we do to protect the Arabic language ?
We don &apos;t know that if we could do that , we don &apos;t know that we need to preserve the Arabic language to protect Arabic .
And so many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why do you worry about why ?
Have you ever been able to do that . You don &apos;t have the problem . &quot; &quot; No problem .
This is what I &apos;d like to say in the Arabic language of Arabic , &quot; I said , &quot; I &apos;m a believer in my life , you &apos;re going to ask me . &quot;
We need to say , &quot; &quot; No ! We don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to do it . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to deal with that .
And if someone came to me , I hate Arabic , I hate Arabic .
We believe , ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — we want to change our lives , and we &apos;re not really interested in changing our lives .
We &apos;re going to be able to get rid of our lives as we are , and we need to live our lives .
So , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think I &apos;m a golfer , but you &apos;re not going to ask me the answer to me . &quot; &quot; Now , I was a golfer .
It &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s very creative and very compelling .
And after that , we started to have another <unk> that we can &apos;t .
You &apos;ve heard that you &apos;re going to put it on the beach , and you &apos;ve got a little bit of black and yellow . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
Why ? You really don &apos;t know .
We don &apos;t rely on language .
If we don &apos;t rely on language , we don &apos;t believe that we don &apos;t have our language .
We &apos;re not going to get rid of our lives .
We &apos;re not going to get recycled .
It &apos;s also serious about our modern and cultural heritage .
After that , we &apos;re going to call &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the girls &apos; 60s and girls .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; for girls and boys .
We &apos;ve got a lot of &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; !
And who tells you , &quot; &quot; Ooh , you don &apos;t call the English word ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No , no . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; But let me tell you a little bit about how much in denial .
I &apos;m going to continue to go on my website . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to live in the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because this is what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s why .
But if we don &apos;t think about this , we can &apos;t believe that if it &apos;s a matter of matter , we need to be more and more of what &apos;s going on , so we need to manage to drive us and change our lives .
You &apos;re not going to be able to get it .
If we can fly into the universe , or the bottom line , we can be creative and creative .
You know , every one of you is a passionate person .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about the essence of you .
Let &apos;s start .
Let &apos;s make a book and a short film .
It &apos;s going to make us global again .
It can make a difference that we need to reconnect the Arabic language .
It &apos;s not flat . It &apos;s not flat . It &apos;s not flat .
But we don &apos;t believe that there &apos;s the way that we are , and we need to be part of the way that we can get part of that way .
Now , what can you do this day ?
Who can &apos;t you ?
And if I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m saying to you , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t think I &apos;m an English speaker .
But in Arabic , in Arabic , you can &apos;t find a mess with a mess .
( Applause ) This is <unk> ! That &apos;s not language !
You end up with a language with your language .
It &apos;s not easy to get back to a place like this .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there are some other things we can do .
We &apos;re not going to be able to see here today .
We need to focus on the context of the language of the language of the language .
Now , I &apos;m a believer in some of you .
The first time I ran through the language , the first time I ran through language .
When I was in my office , I was saying , &quot; &quot; This is what you &apos;re talking about , you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to call it &quot; &quot; in English . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot;
( Applause ) Now , you can &apos;t believe that if you &apos;re going to have this cultural heritage . ( Applause )
So a few years ago , the president of the United States , the president of the United States of America , was on the page of the U.S.
I &apos;ve learned a couple of things in my daily life .
And instead of going on and on and so on , it was always the same kind of thing that we would expect .
Because I &apos;m a little bit of a picture every day .
And before I started our 30 days , I started before .
I also learned that , well , I also learned that , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned , I also learned
And by the way , this is the way , by the way , that we don &apos;t make words from our everyday words .
It &apos;s a novel .
He &apos;s very <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to worry . &quot;
No , I can tell you , if you don &apos;t . &quot;
I learned that I &apos;ve learned a little , very creative and creative thing that I &apos;ve never could ever do .
Actually , they were very lucky .
( Applause )
The first day I started to find myself a lot full of hope and hope for the first day .
And I was very good fliers , and I got a sense that I was very high , and I started talking about my journey full of students , and I had to take a sense of the way I think about it .
This is a kind of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , which was really a great picture .
And I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m very sorry , I &apos;m not going to tell you that the men , the men , the men , and I don &apos;t know what I thought I could do .
But that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you .
It was so compelling that it was so compelling that I didn &apos;t even know how much it was , so I couldn &apos;t guess what I was going to be able to do .
As I started talking , I would like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to tell you what I &apos;ve been talking about before , when I left the room , when I left the room , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to go .
They didn &apos;t know who they were . They didn &apos;t know that they were <unk> , and they didn &apos;t know .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to look at it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re not going to get rid of your life . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
This was a discovery .
And before I got older , then I was able to tell my third question , my third question , my third one .
&quot; He goes . &quot;
And I had a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and then I was able to make sure that it was the way that we could get rid of it , and I was also able to make sure that this is the kind of ties that we &apos;ve experienced in the <unk> of time .
For instance , I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m an actor , and I &apos;m not going to be able to make sure that I &apos;m really happy .
I didn &apos;t feel uncomfortable , but I didn &apos;t feel much worried , but I realized that I felt that I could feel that I could feel more and more and more and more about my experience .
And I was fascinated by my father , and he came out of the <unk> .
And it turns out that we had the <unk> <unk> : the normal people were played together , and my mother was a serious actor .
It starts with a little bit of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which was the second one , I was able to find the second largest <unk> , which was the second one .
We don &apos;t believe that if we don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to <unk> our lives .
And I had to hear about my daughters , and I &apos;d like to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to sit down , you &apos;re not going to sit down , you know , I &apos;m not going to sit down , you know , I &apos;m sorry , you know , I &apos;m not going to sit on the couch .
I didn &apos;t need it , and I needed my courage to talk to him about what I &apos;d like to tell him about .
The sound that I think is right at that moment .
You know , when you look at it , it &apos;s also not the way that we &apos;re looking at it , but it &apos;s also a little bit like I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do .
For instance , I &apos;ve been working as a student in college , and I &apos;ve been working on my blog , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to go on my class , I want you to go back and say , &quot; &quot; I want you to remember , I want you to go .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to get the news news for hours . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
After that , he started to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then the sense that my brother came up with the sense that I had a sense of generosity and hopelessness .
It &apos;s not the fact that it &apos;s not a great life , but it &apos;s not the fact that it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s not the way that you &apos;re feeling it .
This was the <unk> <unk> , which was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was the number of <unk> and <unk> , and more <unk> .
It &apos;s a kind of sound that you can &apos;t see , and you can see that the sound that you can see is the sound of the sound of the body .
For example , if I could tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to see that I &apos;m not going to be able to see myself , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell my life that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell my life , and then that &apos;s how bizarre , like , that kind of like a kind of <unk> <unk> .
The first time I was able to spend the first time in my life , more than three years ago , more than three years ago , more than three years ago , I was more like , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> ?
Where are the water in the water ?
No , let &apos;s put the water out of it , put it on the floor of the teacher , &quot; &quot; I also figured out , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m also curious .
After all , I had the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Two years later , he started to wake up .
No matter what I &apos;ve ever heard of all my life : the horrific voices , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And I had a <unk> , <unk> words for the physical and physical , and I had to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you that you are more comfortable . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that you are more comfortable . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell them that you are more comfortable than that . &quot; &quot; And I had to say , &quot; &quot;
Now , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to get rid of those images , and you can see , you know , if you &apos;re seeing a <unk> , you can &apos;t see it .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to see it , and then you don &apos;t know that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m going to be able to make it .
Many people were suffering from their suffering , and they &apos;re not going to be able to live , but they are very poor , very vulnerable to people who have helped me .
And if I could tell you about the other hand , I had never been able to wake up , and I had never been able to convince her , and I had never been able to convince her , and my mother believed that one day , and my mother believed that I could be able to find myself a little bit , and I had to tell me how much it was to do for that , but I didn &apos;t know what I was going on .
And so we know that Eleanor is not going to happen .
Now , sometimes you don &apos;t know that if you sometimes don &apos;t know that you &apos;re not going to be able to get it , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 14 years old , and I &apos;m not going to fight for 14 years , and I don &apos;t want to thank you for me to thank you . &quot; &quot; Now , I don &apos;t thank you for sure .
But they had to be able to get rid of the courage , and they had to be able to make the rest of our lives .
I would like to tell you that if I could have been able to cut me out , I could tell you that if you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it , you know that I &apos;m going to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to deal with something like this , you &apos;re not going to be able to deal with something like that , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve always been able to deal with , and that &apos;s not what I &apos;ve always been hearing about , but
And of course , what I &apos;ve been hearing about is hard to think about this , and that &apos;s hard to think about it as a result of the fact that the first time that the first step of the first stage was to be able to make sure that the first step of the day .
For example , I learned that I &apos;ve learned that I had to tell you that I &apos;m not just saying that I &apos;m going to be able to attack my heart , but I &apos;ve also learned that I could tell you that I could feel the sense that I could feel like I could .
I believed that my parents .
And if you don &apos;t even know that someday , I &apos;m not sure that if you don &apos;t want to sleep , I &apos;m not going to be able to make it clear that I &apos;m not really sure that we can preserve them .
Now , the problem with that is that I &apos;ve spent many years trying to make a lot of work , and I &apos;m not going to be able to find a lot of work in my life , and I &apos;m not going to be able to see if you &apos;re not going to be able to find a lot of work in your life .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
You have a plastic bag of plastic ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I did .
And if I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about when I &apos;m concerned about the fact that I &apos;m not worried about the fact that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you , I &apos;m not going to tell you how much I &apos;ve ever seen before , because I &apos;ve been able to tell them how much I thought I could tell you , because I had to tell them how much I could tell my story , because I could tell them how much I could read .
I was able to tell you that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to be able to make it better , but I started to ask them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve started to learn more and more ways to learn how to communicate . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I started to learn how to communicate .
All of these things that have happened every single one of these things , I learned that every single one of these things would happen , and I learned that I had never been able to deal with that , and I learned that I had a tendency to find out that I could be able to find that I could live , and I had no idea that I could find that I could be able to find that I could live .
And I had to find that these scars , and I &apos;ve explored , and I &apos;ve discovered that I &apos;ve discovered that my name and <unk> and <unk> and so forth , I &apos;ve discovered that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
And then , after that , I was able to tell you that I had been buried apart from my feet , and I &apos;m not going to get it out of my shoulder , you know , I &apos;m not going to go back to the stratosphere , and I &apos;m not going to go back to another .
After the first time , 10 years later , I was convinced that I was the highest cost of the history of my hometown in the history of my hometown , which became the highest amount of tension in the history of my hometown , which I got in the history of my life .
And one of the things that I thought was going to me when I was one of my friends , I was going to die .
And in fact , if you don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t know that they don &apos;t know that they can &apos;t work .
As I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
And at the same time , you know , I want to get two <unk> <unk> to go to the same .
And I &apos;m going to continue to spend a lot of time talking about health care stories , and I &apos;m going to continue to be able to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , the question is not the question is , isn &apos;t it wrong .
For all of that time , I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve learned about my relationship with my parents , and I &apos;ve also learned that I &apos;ve learned about compassion and compassion .
The most powerful moment in my life is that a woman who doesn &apos;t care about the fact that the women who want to talk about <unk> is that they &apos;re not going to be able to help us find that they don &apos;t want to help us .
And in fact , I &apos;m going to tell you that when I was talking about <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that when I was talking to the <unk> of <unk> , which is the way that we can tell the story of my brother , and the way that we &apos;re going to get rid of our lives , we don &apos;t believe that if you &apos;re not like , you know , you &apos;re not like , you know , you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t
It &apos;s the honor and understanding that you can &apos;t understand and understand how to make a sense of dignity and understanding that you can &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s possible that we &apos;ve been able to make this kind of society .
We have a tendency to find out that social change is not going back back to our social change .
It &apos;s not going to be a human being .
It &apos;s not going to do with people .
To me , I &apos;m not going to tell you that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re not going to be able to read the story , justice is not just saying that justice , justice and mercy are not just words , you know , you &apos;re not talking about the world .
In the last 20 years , we were five years old , and in 26 countries , we &apos;re going to have five countries in 26 countries , and we &apos;re going to be able to hope that if you &apos;re not going to find the possibilities of people , you need to hope that people have access to hope and hope that we need to change our lives .
I &apos;m a believer in the spirit of the human spirit that we need to do with the human spirit , which is the need to be able to use the human body to use this <unk> .
Now , this is the most successful part of the world , to make sure that one of the most important things in your life needs to be , to share , to share with you , to share with you , to share your ideas .
We are , and we &apos;re not going to be able to live in our lives , and we &apos;re not going to be able to see that we &apos;re not going to be able to make it work .
We are <unk> . We &apos;re not .
It &apos;s not going to take us away from us , and it &apos;s not going to take care of us .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Once I say to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you what you &apos;re talking about , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know what you &apos;re talking about .
I &apos;m not going to talk about it . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m not going to tell you about the story of the story .
But it &apos;s not that ?
Because , of course , this is not a picture of a picture .
And yet , when I was 15 years old , when I first came to my first semester .
Now , I &apos;m not going to do this in the past , but in a very different way , because I &apos;ve been able to use the camera to use the camera , which is the process of making the camera .
You can &apos;t see a picture of a picture , so you &apos;re ready to make it open .
To me , it wasn &apos;t going to be the fact that it &apos;s not going to be right in the right place .
I thought I could do this .
So what I &apos;d like to make is a different kind of thing , which is something different from the audience .
Now , images like this : this is what we &apos;ve been able to do .
But it &apos;s an unexpected game .
And yet , it looks like that .
Or the images like this — it &apos;s also a dark color , but it &apos;s also the color that we &apos;re able to do .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
Because , of course , these are really not the images that we can &apos;t see , but we can &apos;t see the images that we &apos;re able to do with the camera .
To deal with you , I &apos;m not going to give you a little bit of fun to deal with it .
So this is really the moment that we &apos;re able to make the right idea more properly than ever before .
What if we could make sure that the real thing is required ?
Have you ever stared at it ?
Have you ever met ?
What do you make ?
Sometimes you can &apos;t make it .
But at the end , we can deal with how to deal with the world , how to deal with the world .
It &apos;s not really what it is , it &apos;s really what we &apos;re going to tell us if we &apos;re real .
So , the idea is that the idea is very difficult .
I &apos;m going to see this kind of thing that I &apos;m going to do with a real science , a reality that I &apos;ve never seen before .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three numbers in the perfect physical spectrum , which is a 3D printer , a 3D printer .
But in a certain way , it looks like the object that exists again in a certain way .
And I also know that it can exist .
So we don &apos;t play games because our brains don &apos;t have meaning that we don &apos;t have meaning .
And I also see the same process that I could find the process .
And this is actually what we &apos;re going to do with a different type of <unk> .
So , a picture really is something that &apos;s really clear about the fact that I think nothing else is not going to do , to everyday life , everyday life .
And if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s really hard to do that , because if you don &apos;t think about it , it seems to be wrong .
So what I &apos;d like to suggest is that we have three simple rules that we need to take to get a real deal .
As you see , these images don &apos;t have a special part .
But if you don &apos;t understand it .
So the first rule has to be the same for the first rule , the <unk> <unk> .
Secondly , it should be the same as the <unk> <unk> .
And in these two ways , these two variables — the same <unk> and the same <unk> .
And third , you can see that the shape of one of the images that you can see is what &apos;s going on when someone comes from , where it comes from .
They &apos;re not going to be able to be able to get rid of it .
The color of the images between the images between the images , the color and the color of the color , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) People do think that this is the bottom line , and I think that it &apos;s going to be the bottom line , and I don &apos;t know .
But actually , this is a picture that we &apos;ve been able to do in different parts of the world .
I think it &apos;s a place where you can create a place where you can make a place where you &apos;re not going to change it .
But it requires many ways .
And this idea of the idea that this idea was a few months ago when I was able to figure out that I was a few months old to find a different place to find out how to find a different place .
For example , the fish is a picture of the fish .
And it &apos;s different from our brains .
The water was taken from six to six months .
And yes , even in the island of the island , I painted the island of the island of Sweden , which is made up of the island of Sweden .
So , if you &apos;re going to get closer and closer to it , I think it &apos;s possible to share with you .
Every time , it &apos;s beginning to get one .
And then it comes together with different ways .
It &apos;s kind of like this , every single piece of a piece .
And if you don &apos;t get good enough , it &apos;s pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s also quite beautiful .
So the whole thing has all the characteristics , and the only thing that we can do is dream of imagining .
Thank you .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian , thank you .
They &apos;ve had a kind of information that I &apos;ve been able to tell you about , in the last year , in the last year , in the last year , in the last year , more information than ever before .
This is <unk> ?
Julian Assange : Yes , that &apos;s possible ?
And the rest of the world is not going to be able to find that bad news in the world , but the whole world will be able to get rid of the whole world than ever in the world than ever in the world .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people do that ?
How do you do that ?
JA : These are the kinds of things that we don &apos;t know about these things . We have different ways of translating this out .
We need to make the information about the information that we need to do with the rest of the world , to make sure that we need to use the information to make the rest of the world , to make sure that the country is in favor .
It turns out that if you don &apos;t think that you &apos;re going to be able to look at it , you don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little difficult news , you know — it &apos;s not a little hard time — it &apos;s not a little hard — it &apos;s a little hard to get rid of our lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to see ourselves with political concerns and political correctness .
CA : So , you &apos;re going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it .
JA : <unk> . You can &apos;t get them rare , and if we don &apos;t get rid of it , we don &apos;t have to go back to that .
( Video ) <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) CA : I think you &apos;re going to be able to see the <unk> code on the <unk> . ( Laughter )
And I think that I think that I can go back .
This is a few years ago .
Let &apos;s look at this .
It was a story .
How do you want to talk about this story ?
JA : This is the <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , in fact , in 2004 , it was <unk> by Kenya .
And in fact , in fact , 18 years ago in Kenya , President Sirleaf was held by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He was <unk> <unk> .
And when we started with the power of the power , they were able to find two million tons of <unk> , and they were able to find two million people on the planet .
And the government of the government , in fact , was used as much as the most rich man , which is the most rich man in the world .
It &apos;s like a book in Kenya .
In the 21st century , we were 28 years old , and I couldn &apos;t afford it .
This is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
CA : CA : You don &apos;t think so long , not directly directly directly from Kenya to Kenya , so that it changed the way that we could get rid of it .
JA : Yes . The first time I got on the list before we got started , and then in the world around the border in Africa , we were in Africa .
He came to <unk> .
In a few days , in Kenya , in Kenya , they started to be comfortable .
And so 20 days in Kenya , you can see in Kenya , and you can &apos;t see the <unk> security of Kenya , and that &apos;s the way that you &apos;re talking about 10 or 20 years old , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;re going to get rid of it .
CA : So , how do you really change the world ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : This time , this time , there &apos;s a video about the weather industry .
Video : A little clip . This is short clip .
Now , we have a little <unk> on this video .
<unk> : ... <unk> , <unk> .
Now , you can &apos;t see it now .
You can &apos;t get it . You don &apos;t know .
You know , when you see it , it &apos;s okay . You &apos;re not .
They &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> !
( <unk> <unk> ) Okay . ( Applause ) Okay . ( Applause )
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to see it .
I needed to go to the door .
All right , we ate eight pounds .
We have two gaps , we &apos;re going to try to try .
All right . All died .
You know , the English speaker , the Dutch speaking .
<unk> . <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
CA : CA : How did this video ?
JA : This is a lot of work for people who have been trained .
This is a video that we &apos;ve spent on this video , two men who are connected to this video .
This is one of the three principles of mine .
CA : ( Applause ) Now , if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to have two meals in your life , you have 11 people who are 11 ?
JA : Yes . Two Reuters workers died , two children injured .
And the guy who &apos;s got married , he died .
CA : And this has led to a broad <unk> .
What was the most important part of my life and what was the main part of my life ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I think people don &apos;t want to be able to get rid of your mind .
And if you don &apos;t know how to go back to the people who walk into the room , you can &apos;t see if it &apos;s not even a reason — and it &apos;s not even a reason — and even if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to get rid of it .
They had two daughters who were very clear about their work and their daughters , and they were able to find out their work .
CA : Now , when the security of the United States of the United States , the way that the security of the United States has been trained to tell you about the video of the United States of America , which is also a video that I can tell you in the U.S.
That &apos;s true ?
JA : We &apos;ve made this article in denial .
Five days ago , there was 150 days before he had the power of the <unk> , which is a <unk> .
This is the year of the U.S. &quot; &quot; The Year of America . &quot; &quot; But they don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be able to do this .
I was on my blog .
CA : Now , if you &apos;re going to use diplomatic policy in the United States ?
JA : You can &apos;t get them . ( CA : Well , yeah . ) JA : Yes . ) JA : What do you do ? ) JA : So what do you do ? ) JA : What do you know from Arabic is a human being .
The secret of the secret is this kind of thing .
CA : I &apos;m not going to have a little bit about it .
If you don &apos;t know , what do you eat ?
How do you feel like the secret to the secret ?
JA : There &apos;s a question that this is a question for the world , which is how to deal with climate change .
And it &apos;s very likely that we can see .
And if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to be able to get the economic power to make sure that you &apos;re not going to be able to get the economic power , you can &apos;t find the information that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s how good they can use the information that they can do .
It &apos;s always going to be like this . It depends on all of our history .
CA : But if you &apos;re not going to be able to get a little bit of trouble , you &apos;re not really sure that it &apos;s a lot of people who have it , but it &apos;s not a bad result .
JA : Well , let &apos;s see that we don &apos;t have to go .
So , you know , you have <unk> <unk> .
They have some personal experiences , and then they &apos;re able to connect with the essence of that line .
And I have a tendency to say that — like , you know , if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;re not going to get rid of it .
CA : That &apos;s all the work that &apos;s been doing .
If the son of the son of the United States , he said to you , &quot; &quot; I can tell you that if you don &apos;t want to make a decision if you don &apos;t want someone else ? &quot; &quot; Now , this video is going to ask me if I didn &apos;t want to ask for a friend ?
The people who don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to take care of our lives .
This shows that we have millions of people around the world who have millions of people around the world . They don &apos;t really do it .
My son doesn &apos;t like that . What do you get from ? &quot; &quot; What do you ask ? &quot; &quot; What do you say ?
JA : There &apos;s a lot of things that are happening .
But if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t need to be able to tell people that you don &apos;t need to do that .
You don &apos;t have the idea of their minds . You don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know .
Every day , I &apos;m not going to wake up .
It &apos;s not about the fact that people spend money in the world , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
CA : So you can &apos;t figure out a way to make a way out of the world , and you can &apos;t figure out a way to make the secret .
It &apos;s good .
But that &apos;s a strange thing that &apos;s very strange that you can &apos;t see if you don &apos;t know , because you don &apos;t know it .
JA : Not exactly that . But it &apos;s not really .
Or even if it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter .
If you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s hard for us . We &apos;re not going to be able to keep us alive ; people work on us , and they try to help us support our lives .
CA : CA : Now , I &apos;ve been interested in looking at the question — what do you do about this ?
There are two kinds of ideas about depression and Julian .
One — I didn &apos;t believe that when I was on the couch .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Who did it ?
And what do you get from ?
JA : Well , no , no , no matter .
CA : This was the people who were people , Julian .
I &apos;m a little bit more optimistic . There &apos;s another example .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m not going to get rid of it .
Isn &apos;t that curious about this curious question ?
What do you do with this ?
JA : This is a <unk> <unk> that we see every day .
In the past year , in the 21st century , we &apos;ve been trained as the Gulf of Mexico , but not as powerful as you can .
So we had an engineer , which is actually an engineer , and we &apos;ve actually been able to do the way that we are able to get rid of the benefits of <unk> , which is actually not the way that we can get rid of our farms .
We had the courage and others here .
And they didn &apos;t have any excuse to do with them . It was a little hard .
And we didn &apos;t know who she was writing , and he didn &apos;t know .
It &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , which is a zero-sum game .
And so , if you look at the literature , you can say , &quot; &quot; We are a little <unk> .
We can &apos;t know how to do it .
Okay . Okay . It looks right , but we can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; And we said , &quot; &quot; No , we want to find out if we &apos;re going to make these kinds of things that are going on , and we call this &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to find a little bit about it .
What do you want to talk about ?
Have you ever wondered what ?
What do you know is that ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re the answer to the <unk> , the <unk> of the owner , the <unk> of the owner .
You can &apos;t see that .
( Applause ) Now , there &apos;s a lot of crap .
This is one of the ways that we &apos;ve been able to tell you a few of the ways that a few of them had been trained to think .
CA : Which would you have to see if you don &apos;t know ?
JA : Yes , I was also very , very , very , very , very , very quickly to keep the rest of our lives .
For the past few months , the last few months for the past few months , we &apos;re not going to get the right news for the past few months .
This is a little problem .
And then , as you can imagine in other words , there is no way that we can see that there are no more things that are happening in the next few years , but there is no amount of information available to the data that we &apos;re going to be able to do .
CA : Which is that I &apos;ve got to tell you that I &apos;ve got to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to get the question for you ?
JA : Yeah . There are people .
Now , in order to grow up in a very different way , we need to have people to develop a very different way to make sure that we need to deal with the security of our cities , and that we need people to deal with the security security .
CA : So why don &apos;t you really deal with that ?
We &apos;d say , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What is this information ?
JA : I had a film <unk> , and I was a religious believer in the religious literature .
( Laughter ) CA : I &apos;m not going to tell you that this carpet is not going to happen in the tent .
JA : What do you mean by movie exploration ?
( Laughter ) CA : ( Applause ) CA : Well , I &apos;m not going to tell you that when you &apos;re young , you &apos;re not going to have the problem , you would have the problem .
JA : <unk> .
I was one of my young friends .
I didn &apos;t know that I was in a young age when I was young in young years old .
We need to make a little bit of friction .
It &apos;s possible to make different things together .
Unfortunately , many of the reasons why I could not expect to do the fact that we were in the middle of our time , was to spend a lot of money in the banking industry .
It &apos;s not just as ago as before .
CA : I can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t think that you &apos;re going to die , you can &apos;t ask me if you don &apos;t want to sleep .
You can make a short amount of information about them , or why do you want to talk about it ?
JA : I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case .
But the question is : I don &apos;t think that if you don &apos;t know , people are going to be able to get rid of our lives ; they need to help us .
My father was my father , my father , my father , who I had learned from people like my father .
CA : And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know how to do it , you can &apos;t see them ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m a little <unk> , you can &apos;t see them , but in the way — you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to see them , you know , if you don &apos;t think about it , you can see the people who are looking for people .
This is what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : CA : What do you want to talk about in the last few decades ?
And there was a problem that I can &apos;t see there , and I was given the information that the information that they could get from there was to take place .
And we &apos;re not going to get rid of it .
You know , I &apos;m not going to make a good job . And then what happened ?
JA : This is a big issue .
It was an economic recession .
It was one of the largest members in the world .
The streets were 10 years old , 10 years old .
This is the data that we &apos;ve found last year .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he didn &apos;t know what he &apos;d like to do , and he didn &apos;t know what he &apos;d like to do , and he didn &apos;t know what he &apos;d like to do .
And I didn &apos;t know if we could get rid of it , and I &apos;m not going to tell you a lot about it , but I &apos;m not going to go there .
And everyone in the audience would have thought that this would be a little bit more worried about that , and that &apos;s where we have a couple of people who have been able to have a new law , and then , in fact , a few years ago , a new law of law enforcement would be a new law in the world , which is a new law in the world , which is one of the greatest institutions in the world , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize in the world .
And I &apos;m not going to be able to get rid of the rest of the world as well as the other .
And just one month ago , this law was known as secret as a secret .
CA : <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> , Julian , <unk> , ( Applause )
What would you like to see if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do ? You know , you &apos;re going to be able to watch every single thing in the world , or when people are going to be able to watch the Great Wall , or they &apos;re going to be able to watch the Great Leader .
JA : I &apos;m not sure why it &apos;s going to happen .
All of our minds are going to be able to talk to each other and talk to each other and talk about each other .
It &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s going on .
We can change everything we live in our lives , and we can change everything we can see .
CA : I feel like you know what you &apos;re talking about , Julian , <unk> , <unk> .
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I didn &apos;t .
When I was writing books and writing books , I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about the story about my story , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about these things , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about these things .
But let me start with that , let me tell you about my personal experience .
As I &apos;ve been able to use my finger , I would have been able to use it — I &apos;m not going to be able to do it — I &apos;m not going to be able to find a few stories from a couple of times .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to be able to get it .
This is a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m going to get it right now .
So I was just a kid who was not the only child who was born .
In the 1970s , in the 1970s , a little strange .
Most of them were the vast majority of our families in our lives , where they were living in the middle of their family , who are the only living women who were living in their lives .
Actually , I &apos;m not going to hear two stories from both sides .
On a side side side , I was <unk> , contemporary , contemporary American women .
On the other side side , I was always religious , religious , <unk> , less <unk> .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get the <unk> of your mouth , you know , you don &apos;t believe that the devil is in the way that you &apos;re going to make the devil .
You can &apos;t believe that when people are deep in the world , the people who are <unk> are <unk> .
Every time I had to go down anyway , I was able to tell you that as much as I could get to get the red red on the floor to get the red red .
And then I &apos;d like to spend a lot of time on my shoulder .
A week later , I was able to get sick for a week .
And I know that I know that science can be curious about this , and it could be strange to tell you about the people who are going on and on and so forth , and I &apos;m not going to tell you that people are going to be able to get rid of them in different ways .
And I said , how did it do that ? That &apos;s the power force ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , we have a lot of surprises , and the power is the power of the power . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a lot of important lessons inside of that . If you don &apos;t think of it in life , you need a lot of important lessons , whether it &apos;s in life , whether it &apos;s in life , and whether it &apos;s going to be the spirit of the human spirit and the spirit of human spirit .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Every one of us now is going to change social and cultural heritage .
We all live .
We all live in a sense , a ring , a ring in the room .
But if we don &apos;t know that we were able to connect the world from the world that we had experienced in the world , we can &apos;t have the risk of being able to live in the world .
We can &apos;t make the power of our bodies . We can &apos;t get rid of our lives .
We don &apos;t believe that if we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not going to take care of our lives , we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of our lives , and we &apos;re not going to get rid of our own lives .
Women like <unk> , all sorts of things , and they &apos;re going to make a piece of <unk> , you know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to sit on the floor , or you &apos;re not going to sit on the floor .
This is what I &apos;m going to do with you . I &apos;ve been able to do a lot of time with a lot of people who have ever been able to make it work .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , that &apos;s one of the greatest challenges that you can share with adults , you know , that &apos;s one of the greatest principles of our world .
And that &apos;s where every place is going on , between the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be able to make the difference between the <unk> and the <unk> , and they don &apos;t talk about it .
It could be the main way that we have to believe that this is the main way that we have this cultural heritage .
I can &apos;t tell the stories that I &apos;m talking about when I don &apos;t hear stories of stories .
So , if you look at this , we can see other worlds , even if we can see other worlds .
I started to find stories about eight years old .
And one day my mother gave me a <unk> <unk> , and he said it would be a good idea for me to get there .
Now , I &apos;m going to argue that if you &apos;re not going to make the idea of that presentation , it &apos;s a little <unk> .
He was very good at home , and he was very good for those stories , but the stories of these stories were not good at all .
When I was talking to my parents , I was a kid who was going to make a conversation with my father , and I was a kid who was a young boy in my life , and my mother would tell me that if my mother had a good idea , I could not see that if my mother had a good idea that I could not see .
But he didn &apos;t know that when my life was born , I was thinking about what was happening , and what I &apos;d like to do with my life was to talk about what was happening .
And instead , I began to write about myself , not about myself , but I started writing about things .
And I started to get rid of my experience when I went on my shoulder .
It was the stories that I had to think about , to try to find more other stories than ever before .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s take a little <unk> : ( Applause ) — that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been hearing about in my life .
This is another event that happened to <unk> .
My mother became a diplomat .
And I also got this little , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where I was in the middle of my country , I was in the world .
For the first time , I had a hard time when I had a hard time to express the phrase &quot; &quot; typical foreign Street . &quot; &quot; And all of my daughters had kids , and I could tell you what I &apos;d like to tell you when I was in school .
And as you can imagine , kids don &apos;t believe that kids don &apos;t want to do anything but they don &apos;t care about themselves .
The United States was also fun , and it was fun , and it was fun for every time every time I had a conversation , and I had a conversation with a conversation .
And if you feel like this , you always get sick , you &apos;re always worried .
And it was good for me , when I was in school , when I was in this age of school , I was in the military school , and he ran out of the <unk> <unk> , and he made a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;m often aware of the frustration that I &apos;m talking about as soon as I &apos;m talking about .
For the first time , I saw this idea of cultural heritage .
All the kids were saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) If you don &apos;t know about a few <unk> days , you can &apos;t sleep on all the <unk> nights , so I don &apos;t know if I could sleep all the time , so I can &apos;t sleep on my shoulder .
I &apos;ve learned about three <unk> points on my face , and these are the <unk> , smoking and bust .
After all , we had to go back and forth , and then we need to reconnect it .
And I think that I could be able to imagine that if I could have imagined that I could be able to find a sense of frustration and frustration , all that I could find in my mind .
The stories that give me a sense that my daughters and my daughters were feeling the sense of solidarity , the sense that my daughters would be alive .
When I was 20 years old , I didn &apos;t believe that I was in Istanbul .
I had a lot of <unk> , and I wrote a <unk> , and I wrote a lot about it .
I was there when I was 14 years old when I was <unk> years old .
I didn &apos;t know what I was looking at when I was able to make the <unk> of the building as I saw the building .
We had an old vendor , an old vendor , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the vibrant life of the adult life .
It was a long black hole in the middle of the mountain , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I saw that I had to put it on my shoulder , and I saw an opportunity to put it on my shoulder , and I had to ask him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a believer in my life . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t know that I was worried about the fact that I had to sleep on my shoulder .
If you don &apos;t know about death and death , we &apos;re going to be able to find out if you &apos;re not going to be able to get a few minutes away from the death of death .
But I was always worried about the fact that they have sex in the way .
We don &apos;t want to tell you that if you &apos;re a strong novel , you can &apos;t tell a good novel , but if you don &apos;t get a good novel , you don &apos;t know that they &apos;re not going to be able to get the people who are not good at all , and sometimes we don &apos;t want to tell the people that we &apos;re not good at all .
And then I went back to my daughters , and I went on to meet my daughters .
It &apos;s not alone , but the language of language is exactly the same .
I started to write .
You can &apos;t see what you &apos;re talking about , you know , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know why I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m not going to change the way .
I mean , I think I &apos;m going to be able to get rid of my life , and I &apos;m more likely to be able to do it . I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to be able to do it .
I think we can &apos;t think differently .
I &apos;ve also learned about the way in the world as a human being in the world , a language language , the language of English .
The language of the language later , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And then as a result later , we &apos;re going to be able to get better words , more and better words , better words , better than we can , because our brains and our language would be bigger and bigger .
This is the difference .
But if you don &apos;t think about it , that &apos;s what you can see .
This was the way that I learned that I was living — and I had a bust and bust .
Now , in this time , I &apos;ve been able to spend all the time in my everyday life in my daily life , so I could find that my life in my daily lives , and then , in my life , I would have been able to find a place in my life , and then I couldn &apos;t see it .
You know , God is not going to be a family part of a family .
( Laughter ) But instead , I went to the <unk> .
And I began to find out that when my wife knew that my life was in the Arizona Istanbul , I could do that as much as I could possibly find out of the world .
Now , part of the time , I &apos;m always going to be thinking about the physical and physical reality .
It &apos;s as if all of our rituals and determination to make sure that it was always the case for me .
I could tell you that the story of the story that I &apos;m worried about , that I could make the story more than I was on my shoulder .
I &apos;d like to tell you about this problem .
And one of the things I wrote was a <unk> that I wrote in the United States in America , which was one of the founders of the United States .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve just got a little bit different . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a <unk> . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked what I mean .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you look at the literature , you have a lot of <unk> , you have a lot of <unk> , you have the U.S. , and you have one <unk> , and you have one of the people who have never been in college . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to call a university in college . &quot; &quot; But I didn &apos;t know what it meant to me .
But I also know it &apos;s always going to continue .
He wanted me to be my personal experience .
That was the woman who I &apos;m talking about as women who were women , who I am in my country .
And I &apos;m always going to tell you about the world that I &apos;m always going to tell you about , and that &apos;s what we can do with it , and that &apos;s how we deal with it , and then we can see that it &apos;s going on .
Most of you are not particularly <unk> , especially if you &apos;re not <unk> or not .
If I could talk about Islam from the Islamic world , I would argue about Islam as well as a woman , if I don &apos;t know about the women &apos;s women .
More <unk> , depressing , <unk> stories , the typical story of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that the world is going to exist in the world .
It &apos;s not just as creative people who have a personal idea , not as creative people , but as a couple of writers , a friend of mine , a friend of mine , a friend of mine .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> .
In 1998 , when I was born , I was asked a couple of times a question that I asked him about a few times a few years ago .
And if you don &apos;t know about the fact that the blue writer , the blue writer , the blue writer , said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t have anything that I don &apos;t know ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to have anything to do with your life ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the same .
There is a <unk> <unk> that has no <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
About 10 years ago , a few years ago , I was very good fliers .
They were three years old , a man , a man , a friend of mine , and I didn &apos;t believe that .
( Laughter ) But it wasn &apos;t the way we put us together , and we don &apos;t care about it .
It was alone .
We need to write real stories on the other side .
<unk> is a <unk> .
In this way , not alone , it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re even more powerful than they are , but they become more powerful than they are .
We need to say that the story of the story is not in fact that it doesn &apos;t exist .
All around the world .
I saw this for the first time when I was the first time I was in 1958 , I didn &apos;t know that I was going on .
And I think we can &apos;t hear about the experience of being able to read and talk about the way we talk about it , and we don &apos;t talk about it .
It &apos;s a big big deal with the small <unk> , which is a big big problem .
Now , some of the people who were talking about <unk> <unk> me , who I &apos;ve been talking about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
But I &apos;d like to tell you all of the things that are happening at that moment .
Just a story .
He said , &quot; &quot; Just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Just a story . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t matter how to deal with it , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
You can &apos;t see if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t see if you don &apos;t know , but if you don &apos;t have political challenges , you don &apos;t think about everyday language .
And so this is what it said : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to be able to get the right thing , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re not going to get it right .
And it &apos;s a job that we &apos;re trying to do . &quot; &quot; And we can &apos;t get rid of it . You can &apos;t see it .
One is a <unk> .
It &apos;s a thick temperature .
One is a position .
You can &apos;t see the front floor .
You &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
It &apos;s water from water .
There was a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a story called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re not going to tell you stories , and they &apos;re going to tell stories about stories .
We need to put it in different ways to make the words in different ways .
You know , if you don &apos;t hear it , you don &apos;t know , people don &apos;t hear it , you don &apos;t hear it , you know .
The stories of stories : the Middle East , North Africa , North Africa , <unk> and <unk> .
Today , stories today , stories of stories .
They &apos;re talking to each other , and they &apos;re not talking to each other , but they don &apos;t listen to what they &apos;re saying , but if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re not going to be able to get the rest of your life , you &apos;re thinking about the story .
We &apos;re not going to get rid of our lives .
If you don &apos;t know it , you don &apos;t want to do it .
It saved my life in the middle of a stadium , and it saved my life .
But there &apos;s also a lot of evidence that we don &apos;t know .
After all , in the spirit of the spirit of the spirit and the spirit of the spirit of the spirit , the first job was to watch the first job , the first job that was placed in the room , watching the sounds of the text .
And I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell you that if you don &apos;t want to tell you that you don &apos;t want to tell you that you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re not going to be able to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to solve the problem . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve got a lot of ways to think about the problem that we can &apos;t solve today &apos;s problems , and we have a lot of people who don &apos;t have the problem ,
There is a <unk> <unk> : I &apos;m not living as the action .
And one of the things is fixed .
On the other side , it makes a permanent difference , a connection between each other .
I didn &apos;t believe that .
And part of the story that you can see is that you &apos;re not going to be able to get a part of your life , and the other part of the other side is a connection between each other .
This is a kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I believe that it &apos;s everywhere .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get a couple of years ago .
It exists in a place called <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s where it is between .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve done .
We often have the <unk> <unk> between the <unk> .
They &apos;re trying to figure out where they &apos;re going to be able to find out where they &apos;re going to be able to be able to find that they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to find that they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to live in the world .
But what I think I think is that we need to be able to get rid of our lives .
I &apos;m not going to be able to get the <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about 10 months after 10 years old .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
This is a little bit about a woman , and I can tell you about a woman , and I &apos;ll be a happy woman , and I &apos;ll be a happy woman .
And as long as you &apos;ve got to go through , you can see a little bit about it .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , our ancestors tell us , &quot; &quot; which says , &quot; &quot; Oh , the soul says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m not sure .
And I &apos;m going to deal with that , why don &apos;t we still think about things that we don &apos;t yet know about things that we don &apos;t know .
Maybe it &apos;s not really good to start .
It &apos;s not based on what we are , and what we &apos;re thinking about is not based on what we &apos;re going to do .
We need to tell each other about how to make a sense of being able to connect each other .
We &apos;re not going to meet other stories , we can &apos;t find other worlds .
You know , you &apos;re not going to be able to go on the floor , as long as you walk .
I &apos;m not standing in the political condition in the political condition , they &apos;re all <unk> . And this is good .
We &apos;re going to end up talking to the ancient metropolis of ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; Oh , thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s a little bit of a little <unk> that &apos;s going to be able to make a big idea that I &apos;ve been able to make a big idea .
This is a little <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , here is a <unk> part of the <unk> .
They &apos;re not .
And I had to deal with my parents .
Two years ago , a half of a sudden <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My head was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I started to realize that when I was born , I started to realize .
I &apos;m not going to go out , I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so I can tell you that the only way to be happy is to be able to get the only way to be happy .
( Applause ) This is the women who are women who are women .
The bottom line is the most underlying factor .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because I &apos;m very sorry , I &apos;m not sure that you can &apos;t see it .
This was when I was talking about a couple of years ago when I was talking about a couple of hours ago , I was going to tell you about the night sky .
I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; — obviously — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t .
If we were five hours old , it would be more interesting if it was five hours ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Most of you have ever been able to get less trouble .
Here we are , in the morning , in the morning , in the morning , and I &apos;m going to invite you , &quot; &quot; 8 <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And if you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; 8 ? &quot; &quot; And if you don &apos;t know anything , you &apos;ll see , you know , if you &apos;re not going to get eight , you can see that you &apos;ll have a little <unk> , and then you can see , you know , I don &apos;t know , because I &apos;m not sure that they
They need to have the courage to go .
Not being a good leader , not a good leader , but I didn &apos;t want to be a good leader .
You don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to make it .
I think the winner is the winner of the big investment in the <unk> , and I &apos;m still standing in the middle of the world .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> 24 hours from 24 hours a day , maybe eight or eight hours old , and maybe it would cause what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s the most useful for the world that we live in a living room , which is useful for the world that we live in a living room , that we live in a living room , the most useful for the whole world .
I &apos;m more optimistic that I &apos;m going to get to know that if you don &apos;t want to deal with a big deal , you can find the power of your devices , your devices .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Because the brain is able to repair the brain with the brain .
What is the problem ?
Dr. <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Normal as a normal phrase , I think that we need to tell people that we don &apos;t want to be normal . &quot;
And I learned that I was also the disease that I didn &apos;t know .
I was like a kid who was a kid who was a kid .
If you can imagine the brain , the brain is made up of two roles .
This is a part of the landscape that &apos;s in the background .
They &apos;re parallel with parallel .
I had two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then I think about the different things about different things , and even more different things happen .
I &apos;m sorry . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . <unk> .
And the right brain , our brain , the way we communicate is the way we communicate .
It &apos;s the moment that we &apos;re not going to be able to tell all the things that we &apos;re going to do at the moment that we &apos;re not going to be able to talk to all of our minds , how we &apos;re going to be able to understand how it feels like , how do you feel , and how it feels .
We &apos;re a <unk> <unk> that we can do with our brains .
And at that point , this is the perfect , full and <unk> .
The left brain is a whole another place .
And then I think I can &apos;t get my left side .
The piece of information that we can see on the left is that part of the information that you can find on the left floor .
And the left brain is a language .
We can &apos;t live our lives on the outside world .
This is a sound that says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go home .
And what I &apos;ve always got to tell us is that we need to get rid of our lives .
And I was on my own journey , and I started to play sports with my team .
I &apos;m not saying that if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to find that you &apos;re going to be doing it .
I feel like I can go through my shoulder .
And I decided to take a shower .
<unk> <unk> .
I can &apos;t believe in the atomic nucleus , and I can &apos;t do it .
And the only thing I could do was the outside energy — power energy .
Have you ever wondered what ?
It &apos;s everywhere , and all of our senses , all of our senses , and all of our senses , all of our senses , and all of our bodies , all of our senses , and all of our bodies , all of our senses , and all of our bodies , all of our senses , and all of our bodies , all of our senses , and all of our bodies , all of our senses , and all of our bodies , all of our senses , and all of our bodies , all
You know , I feel like I can &apos;t see .
You can &apos;t imagine that you &apos;re not going to get your eye .
He was feeling sick .
And again , my left brain is <unk> .
And at that moment , right now , right now .
And then , &quot; &quot; Oh ! !
( Laughter ) And then I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do with you ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> . &quot;
You need to get rid of the market , you need to call a call to call it .
We &apos;re going to try to call it .
And what we &apos;re going back back to the rest of the world .
And so that &apos;s one of the things that we &apos;ve been able to do with the telephone , which is one of the numbers that the telephone had led to .
Again , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about the Golden Rule .
What if you don &apos;t understand my life in my life .
And the brain is connected between two and two .
It &apos;s how big it is .
Or , just a little bit of time , I &apos;ve had a strong <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re not going to see the right thing .
