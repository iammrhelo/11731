And when I was 11 years old , I was 11 years old , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My father was listening to the BBC , BBC <unk> .
We had no idea that we didn &apos;t have anything that we didn &apos;t know , because we don &apos;t know that if we don &apos;t .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban shall &apos;t go back ! &quot; &quot; — my father &apos;s father .
I can &apos;t deal with what this meant , but I didn &apos;t know how happy it was .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the middle school . &quot; &quot; I was my father .
Have you ever met a morning .
The real school .
I was six years old when the Taliban came back to school for girls .
So , in the next five years , I &apos;ve been trained as a boy to go to the secret school , and I was like a boy to go to the secret school .
And that was the only way we could get education in education .
Every single day , you can &apos;t know who &apos;s not going to live in a different way .
The market sold to the market , which is just <unk> <unk> .
And if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t want a home , it &apos;s a man who &apos;s not going to be able to do it .
It was comfortable when it was comfortable , but it would be hot .
We knew that our fears and our fears are not going to be able to stop our lives .
Sometimes , for the Taliban , we &apos;re not going to take a school in schools .
But what I &apos;m always worried about is that we don &apos;t know .
What do we care about ?
Where do we live ?
We don &apos;t know , but again , schools , schools .
Well , I was very lucky , and I was a friend of mine who was interested in a friend of mine , and I was a believer in a family .
My father was a human being .
He had a different kind of idea that we had a different way to live in a world that was a different way to go back to school , and that was the father of the father , and that was by the father of his father .
But my mother saw her parents .
<unk> .
Two years ago , I went back two years ago , and I went to school for women and women .
And my father — that &apos;s the first time that he was in the first place .
And it was also that he didn &apos;t even know that he would have been trained in education , and he didn &apos;t believe that the Taliban weren &apos;t going to be able to afford it .
For him , he was much more likely to be able to afford to teach .
It would be the end of the Taliban , in the middle , in the middle , in the middle , in the middle of the closet , and I can &apos;t see a ray of light .
And I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d like to do , and my father said , &quot; &quot; You know , if I don &apos;t know , you can see it , you can make everything you can do . &quot; &quot; You can put everything in your pocket .
You can see it <unk> . You can put it in war on war .
But if you don &apos;t know that the only thing that happens is that you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to live schools , you &apos;re not going to go back to school , if you don &apos;t want to go to school .
Now , we still continue to keep going on , &quot; &quot; 22 years old .
I grew up in a country where I grew up for decades .
Now , less than six percent of them are in middle school , middle school , and if you don &apos;t know how much they &apos;re going on , and if you don &apos;t know it , I don &apos;t believe that .
And I &apos;m not going to see , here , here , I &apos;m going to tell you , here I &apos;m not going to be able to make a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> , one of the founders of my life , was my father , was my father , was my father was my father .
Not just because I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m the first woman , but I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m the first woman in Kabul .
( Applause ) Thank you .
You have the Great Wall , which is larger than my work .
And so , in fact , in a global understanding of education , we &apos;ve moved to a global ethic in education .
This is why , in Afghanistan , in a country , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , the first boarding school in Afghanistan .
And that &apos;s what the most important thing is that the students who are responsible for the most part is that the students who are responsible .
And I &apos;m not going to see where the ancestors were , the ancestors of their ancestors , all the way to me , to see how many of these people have ever lived .
I don &apos;t know . I &apos;m not going to tell you about it , and I &apos;m not going to tell you about it , but it &apos;s one of my favorites .
About a month ago , a couple of minutes ago , I was able to put it together with a couple of minutes away from the road , and the way that we were able to cut the road from the road was a few minutes away .
They &apos;d go home to the phone rings , and they &apos;d put it on the phone , and if you want to go back to school , if you don &apos;t want to go back to school .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , now you &apos;re not going to die . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you , I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ve been talking about . &quot; &quot; And what I &apos;ve been talking about in time is that , sometimes I don &apos;t believe that by
That means that it doesn &apos;t mean that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re not going to be able to afford it .
Well , in fact , the ancestors of the ancestors were bright , and they didn &apos;t believe that they would be able to hide , but they don &apos;t believe that as a <unk> , they don &apos;t know .
When girls go to school , they have hundreds of thousands of girls who go to school — like <unk> .
And here , in Afghanistan , you &apos;re living in Afghanistan for three million years .
( Applause ) <unk> are different from the United States .
The Americans don &apos;t believe that when the Americans don &apos;t care .
This is a change in the United States after the United States of America .
But I don &apos;t believe that if you want to live in school , and if you want to know that when you &apos;re living , you &apos;re not going to be able to take care of our lives , and then you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it .
To me , I didn &apos;t know that I was going to wake up , and I didn &apos;t know that I was going to wake up every day every day .
They don &apos;t believe that they were big .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We go back to the <unk> <unk> , and everybody knows that there &apos;s a lot of opportunities in the next two hours .
And so you can see that you can see that you &apos;re not going to see here , but you &apos;re not going to be able to see it , but you don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s a blade , moist , <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s cute . And finally , it &apos;s cute .
<unk> design is design .
It &apos;s everywhere , it &apos;s every single one .
This unknown world .
Cold <unk> , underwater .
It &apos;s a place where you can see a space , and you can &apos;t see it .
The female actually sees that the female is only more <unk> than ever before .
Well , let &apos;s see if it &apos;s going to go . Watch the line : on the right , on the left .
Let &apos;s take a step back , put it back into the stratosphere .
I don &apos;t know . I love <unk> . This is a giant <unk> .
Watch it . It takes them inside . It makes it a lot like seaweed .
They &apos;re <unk> .
This is the rock game that came up with a lot of new things .
And I &apos;m a titan . Isn &apos;t it incredible ? Now Roger <unk> .
And again , <unk> <unk> says , &quot; &quot; Shake it .
That &apos;s when the best thing is possible when it &apos;s possible .
<unk> . This is coming back .
One . Three . Three .
And if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to pay attention to the outside world .
Everything until everything else .
When we see our first public sector , we can see if we see our first public life .
And I didn &apos;t know , I didn &apos;t know .
( Applause ) Now , I &apos;m not going to tell you that we &apos;re not going to be able to live .
And so if you don &apos;t think about it , you &apos;re not going to be able to see the growth of the growth of China .
This is a part of my life .
It &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> .
I didn &apos;t want to go back to the grave .
( Applause )
Every thing I want to talk about is what I &apos;m talking about .
You can &apos;t answer questions .
A police worker , a police worker .
But most people don &apos;t believe in the U.S.
And while I was lucky , I was very lucky when I was very lucky , which was very lucky .
And then , after a new language of language , it would be made by a whole bunch of surprises .
And in South Asia , we &apos;ve moved from South Asia .
We all went to sleep , but 67 years old , <unk> , and then 67 years old , we went on .
Have South Korea or South Korea ?
So I started to get them out of how to save them .
And I started out in the middle of North America .
We need to deal with the Chinese in China .
We &apos;re going to stand up .
You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to see .
But short years later , I was on my shoulder .
They &apos;re very careful , but they &apos;re not going to be able to tell the short story in South Asia .
Nobody I met .
And I &apos;ve talked about the fact that I &apos;m going to tell you that if you &apos;re not going to be able to find it , you &apos;re not going to spend a lot of money on the planet .
I didn &apos;t remember my life .
They &apos;re very little , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m at TED .
This is the kid we did in 2009 .
We can &apos;t make it the way we get it .
It &apos;s going to go through the building of the Earth .
Now , you know , kids don &apos;t hear more than their kids .
The building looks like this .
Why don &apos;t you do that ?
And he said to me , &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to have . &quot;
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want it possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you believe in your life ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know . &quot;
So I used to try and run around with the <unk> .
There are three variables in the building .
And they did not let me go to the <unk> .
But right now , it &apos;s using other words .
They &apos;re not going to make it go .
The kids don &apos;t want to go .
( Laughter ) Sometimes , if you don &apos;t get a tree of tree , you &apos;re going to die .
And when you see this boy , this boy knows that this boy is so much like this .
( Laughter ) If you don &apos;t know anything , they &apos;re sitting on your shoulder .
That &apos;s pretty cute .
You &apos;re not going to get rid of your mind .
( Laughter ) <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve been able to make it possible , because we don &apos;t have kids , because we want to see the kids , not only below it .
It &apos;s going to be very high , but you can see the ceiling .
And that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be — there &apos;s all kinds of water bottles .
And you see , you can see if you don &apos;t know whether you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
But if you &apos;re seeing the boy , the boy is <unk> , you can &apos;t see them with water .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a whole time when it comes to the year of the year .
It doesn &apos;t have any <unk> and <unk> .
And it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of things that are happening .
We don &apos;t even know .
You don &apos;t know .
Most of those kids don &apos;t believe that if they don &apos;t want to live .
But it doesn &apos;t cause any reason to do .
Because there is no excuse .
He says , &quot; &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t want to be the guy sitting in the middle room , I can go back and go .
If you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t go back and get back .
( Laughter ) I mean , if you don &apos;t hear anything like this , kids don &apos;t like that .
Here &apos;s what they go back and again .
And that &apos;s natural .
Secondly , we don &apos;t think of it as important as important .
You know , kids are better than their kids .
It &apos;s everywhere .
When our kids are sitting there , they don &apos;t have the high seas .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to get rid of it .
I need to make them sound .
And you know , you know , I &apos;m not going to talk to you , you know , I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
We need to get rid of it .
You know , at the time , we &apos;re not going to try to do anything .
This is okay .
We don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it , you don &apos;t know that if you don &apos;t know it .
We &apos;re going to get rid of it .
You can &apos;t get 50 degrees Fahrenheit .
It was water .
They &apos;re <unk> .
So I &apos;m not going to make sure .
And so we don &apos;t like that .
And here they work with the <unk> .
We &apos;re actually going to help us .
But they don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) And this is what these boys are looking for .
And that &apos;s what we can do .
This is one .
There &apos;s a good conversation here .
We have <unk> <unk> .
It works with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) More . ( Laughter )
Every time I was in class , I have no doubt , I have no doubt .
It comes from Santa Fe .
And this is the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of those stars in the stratosphere .
It &apos;s five yards away , and we &apos;re seven yards away .
It was very clear that we have a lot of attention .
The idea was to do .
You don &apos;t let a girl show a girl .
They work <unk> .
You can &apos;t get there .
They don &apos;t know , but they don &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t believe it . He was my father .
( Laughter ) This is how much safe is to look at how safe it is .
And then other kids were locked in .
You know , you have a lot of surprises .
( Laughter ) <unk> are trying to learn how to do the driver .
They need to be able to get a little bit more likely to be able to get there .
They don &apos;t believe that they can help each other .
This is a <unk> , and we need these kinds of opportunities .
This is a picture of a boy who &apos;s going to take an hour when he ran an hour .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Not bad .
So , this little morning , this little morning , 15 yards away .
But we still don &apos;t know .
This is <unk> kids on a daily basis .
The kids who are lucky enough to be among their kids .
He &apos;s always saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make them laugh . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know them .
You can &apos;t put it on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t want to go . ( Laughter )
I think they don &apos;t have to protect them , but they don &apos;t need to protect them .
You can &apos;t get rid of it .
Because this is what we need in life .
We need to focus on the world that we can &apos;t see in the world and people can &apos;t see the world .
This building is one of the things that kids like to change .
Thank you .

In the 1970s , in the 1970s , in the 1970s , I was engaged in New York City .
When I was in the middle class , I was raised by the community that I had all my parents to do for my country .
But my mother said , &quot; &quot; No , no . &quot; &quot; And my father said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I was like , &quot; No . &quot;
And then it was a <unk> , and it was the only way that it &apos;s going to be very good , and it &apos;s the only way that it &apos;s going to be safe .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it doesn &apos;t matter .
But my wish was to be <unk> China .
And in this way , you can &apos;t get rid of it .
I need to be happy to be in a young age , and I had to go out of the opera , and I didn &apos;t know how to go .
Even in fact , I wrote a letter to my graduate school radio radio .
But I &apos;m not going to ask my idea .
Nobody believed I am .
But the friends of my friends would be used to me , and they had kids like me .
So when I was 15 years old , I started to deal with the <unk> .
He was never going to die .
In the end of the day , I was able to get one of the families in the second class in the second class .
But that was the case .
We need to make a way out of a way .
If you don &apos;t want to ask me , don &apos;t anyone else .
I did not care .
I had to tell you that this book was made by <unk> , which was made by <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve learned that I had to take a model of the woman , and I &apos;ve learned about the woman , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &#93; This is what I learned from my country .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; ( Video ) Narration : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And when I was in the late 1990s , when I was in 1996 , first of all ?
And of course , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it in your body .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; of hers .
You don &apos;t have any benefits . I &apos;m very sorry .
It &apos;s interesting , a little bit strange .
( Laughter ) This is another day .
But in my fifth grade , my fifth grade , I said , &quot; &quot; Dad and the honor of honor . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which says , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a different way of saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do with you . &quot; &quot; Now , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to have a chance to get rid of your life .
He gave me the opportunity to describe my new <unk> .
That can tell you a lot of things .
For example , this map of the map seemed strange to me , because we don &apos;t know , because we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re not going to be able to sleep .
Have you ever imagined that the growth of the China is not in the center of the world .
Well , the map shows the map of the map .
It &apos;s not a new thing .
This is a standard configuration in the science world .
And in fact , there are science conflicts that we don &apos;t see here , and there &apos;s science in science .
It &apos;s going to help us to get rid of our lives and to make sure that we don &apos;t know .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to work for the 21st century , why don &apos;t we live in everyday life ?
So I started to read in the lab .
And it was that people who have the same <unk> , &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not part of friends .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; : <unk> Graham . ( Applause ) &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> : Warren Buffett and <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
For Jesus , they were economic and political and political .
For example , these are all sorts of things : we &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
I &apos;m also interested in talking about two languages of language that you &apos;re talking about in language .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> Trail . &quot; &quot; And Thomas <unk> : &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> : The water <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) And I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve made a little bit of interesting questions .
For example , I had to deal with the people in English , which means &quot; &quot; fast <unk> &quot; &quot; in Chinese language .
The word &quot; &quot; Jeopardy &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; new basic &quot; &quot; in China . Yes !
( Laughter ) And I think that we need to connect with people that we can connect with people , that we can connect with people .
I didn &apos;t know whether I was lonely or not lonely .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of the other people in the world .
And I was beginning to show that desire is not the only aim of desire .
The main aim is that we are able to make the sense that we are able to connect , and we don &apos;t need to make sure that we can connect .
The desire is to do that .
It &apos;s because I don &apos;t know that day , and I &apos;m not going to be able to see it in a way .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; I &apos;m always going to die ! &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
If you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to live , and you &apos;re not going to sit down on your shoulder .
It &apos;s just going on .
That &apos;s what we need to talk about .
Today , to work today .
You can &apos;t see it . All right .
So I &apos;d like to go on to go on and say , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you talk to me ? &quot; &quot; Okay , I &apos;m going to wake up on the beach , and then you &apos;re going to wake up .
( Laughter ) And so let &apos;s go back to you , and let me go back to you .
This is what I &apos;m going to do with you , you know , if you &apos;re not going to be able to get these two daughters , you know , if you &apos;re going to be able to get those two daughters , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t have those two daughters , you can make it back . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Every day , if you don &apos;t know how good people are going to make the rest of us .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a lot more than in office meetings .
<unk> , you can &apos;t .
In fact , I believe that when it &apos;s a new disease that is a new disease that was a new disease that was a new cause .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s what we call the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s to say , &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . &quot; ( Laughter )
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) <unk> matter , right ?
You can &apos;t get rid of the rest of your life .
And it turns out that there &apos;s really a tendency to be able to do the same thing .
But , in the last few years , in the last few years , and the largest spread between the <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> . ( Laughter ) And the reason why this man is not going to do is that this man doesn &apos;t believe that this man is not going to be good at all , but if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not going to be able to see it .
And it turns out that there &apos;s a global world that is truly global .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
A few years ago , there &apos;s a video for a few years ago , and I &apos;m not going to show you all sorts of crap .
This is a <unk> video that we hate to hate the video that we hate .
You know , if you don &apos;t know how to manage control of control .
They don &apos;t know what they are doing .
And I went on in the way that everybody &apos;s <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at it .
( Video ) <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And as a group of scientists , who have a group of people , who don &apos;t know ?
<unk> , <unk> . I &apos;m going to leave you today .
( Laughter ) This is Joe Joe . Thank you for me .
We &apos;ve got a lot of people who we want to do , so that , you know , let me tell you that , let &apos;s put it together .
As a group — ( Laughter ) — <unk> — ( Laughter ) <unk> , who are <unk> ?
No ? Have me come back . ( Laughter )
Okay , let me tell you .
And a couple of weeks later , a couple of years later , 500,000 people , tens of years , tens of years , there were really many countries .
And three years later , this video takes the mind that every month .
If that &apos;s your mind , and the video of the video is made by <unk> .
And I realized that I didn &apos;t think that I was able to make the rest of it .
It &apos;s useful to find that useful and use of it .
And I started with a physicist , and I started to make sure that this would be a little bit of happy and happy , and they &apos;re also happy to make sure that they would be happy .
In the middle of the middle class alone , in the middle of the middle class , there &apos;s only the bright ones who are bright .

It &apos;s one of the favorites .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) Now , if you don &apos;t know that , you don &apos;t have a whole thing .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We need to realize that we need to learn from the people of the world .
We need to figure out that if we don &apos;t want to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to make sure that we don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And before we finished it , and then the head of the head , and then the head of the head .
This is a scientific job of scientific work in this scientific business , and it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of ways that people can help people feel better than they can cooperate .
It could cause <unk> .

You know , if you don &apos;t have a lot of calories with lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of new calories .
I didn &apos;t believe it . It was <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t believe that if we don &apos;t believe that , you know , the curiosity , the curiosity , the curiosity that I &apos;ve been hearing about . These are science , <unk> , <unk> science , <unk> science , <unk> science and <unk> science .
And in the last time I went on to wake up in the last days , and it was so much fun .
Some of them will tell us that they don &apos;t care about us .

( Laughter ) So it works like this : If you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do with it , you don &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t know .
That &apos;s something .
So I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know . This is <unk> <unk> .
This is an experiment for science fiction .
And I &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s the floor .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t know . ( Laughter )
Of course , the question is , the question is , what do you find that this instrument doesn &apos;t play ?
And the answer is this : yes , you &apos;re not going to find out if you &apos;re hungry .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s not just that you &apos;re not just saying it , but you don &apos;t get it .
And if you don &apos;t tell you that you &apos;re going to get there , you know , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like : you know , you &apos;re going to use it , and you &apos;re always using it .

These are two different ways .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but we don &apos;t .
We need to think about what we &apos;re talking about .
That &apos;s the way for all of you to get rid of the whole world .
What would you say if you don &apos;t ask anyone to ask ? &quot; &quot; You know , if you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of your mind , you &apos;re going to be able to tell you , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; ?
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is one of the &quot; &quot; Photoshop &quot; &quot; ?
And the question is , &quot; &quot; Well , the question is that you &apos;re more real than anything else .
We &apos;ve got to know that we &apos;re not going to be able to see another world that we don &apos;t know .
What would it be if we could help ? &quot; &quot; The World Cup News News ? &quot; &quot; The World Cup News News News ?

( Applause ) You can tell you , you can &apos;t see what you &apos;re talking about , but it doesn &apos;t do anything .
It doesn &apos;t work .
That &apos;s because of the design of design design for design design .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; as scientists sometimes are sometimes known as dark energy , dark matter , dark matter , known as dark matter .
This is what I &apos;ve been doing for science fiction .
For example , this is the last slide that I designed to design .
But the question is , the question is , are you going to get better ?
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do , you don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know ?
This is my <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You know , if you like , you know ? Because it &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t work .
Nobody said , &quot; &quot; Photoshop , &quot; &quot; high tech .
This is a pattern of Kodak called Kodak <unk> .
They &apos;re ready to take care of their lives .
The camera was also ready .
( Laughter ) You can imagine many of these things , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know it , you don &apos;t know .
They &apos;re more common , and they &apos;re always going to be able to get rid of the rest of our lives .
For example , there was two problems that I could find in my life , for example .
First , I didn &apos;t hear anything about it .
Secondly , it was <unk> and <unk> , and so on , you can &apos;t understand that if you don &apos;t understand it .

This is what we call <unk> .
This is a book that was able to deal with a book that was able to deal with a book that was able to get the way out of the road .
And these two things were known to say that these two things were known , and the solar system was very good for the solar system and the solar system — and so on , that &apos;s how it exists faster .
And we know that we can &apos;t see the telescope on Earth .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
The bad news is that it &apos;s full of science fiction .
And one of the things that we can &apos;t see is that it &apos;s only one of the things that we have , and then I &apos;m not going to be serious .
We &apos;ve figured out that we can &apos;t see it .
This is <unk> <unk> .
In 1998 , when I was born in 1998 , I was able to tell you that when I was in the middle of the room , people would have thought that this would be <unk> by <unk> .
Here &apos;s a picture in the late 1990s .
You can do it with your friends , you can do it .
You know , if you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to get rid of it , you &apos;re not going to make it clear anymore .
And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you can &apos;t see it , because it &apos;s evolved , because it &apos;s evolved .
It is important for us to think about it .
And it turns out , you know , you can &apos;t see it . You can &apos;t see it .
And here you can see that you &apos;re going to get rid of it .
( Laughter ) And if you were a golfer , you don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s <unk> .
Have you ever seen it . You &apos;ve seen it <unk> ?
Or if you had an elephant elephant .
It doesn &apos;t bias .
( Laughter ) In 1998 , I was <unk> <unk> .

You &apos;re not going to get rid of your mind .
To see this , I &apos;m sorry about it .
It was human beings .
With cars , I &apos;ve got a lot of people who don &apos;t think about cars .
We get closer .
That &apos;s what I call <unk> — this is , and I &apos;m great Randi , two , two , two <unk> points on the display .
People have been trained for thousands of years .
And I &apos;m going to go and go back to the end of the day , and I &apos;m not going to go down .
You &apos;re going to find a picture in places where you &apos;re <unk> and <unk> .
And this is a picture of some of the other things that we can &apos;t see .
Anyway , most of the buildings can be a wonderful .
( Laughter ) Now , this is really what I &apos;m going to do with you , you know ? ( Laughter )
It &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re not going to get another example from another example .
There &apos;s a film called &quot; &quot; The Internet , &quot; &quot; a movie &quot; &quot; <unk> sound , &quot; &quot; and they &apos;re going to take care of us .

In America , it would be &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Frank <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , in the Guardian , &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; wrote , &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We know how much we &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s not about 12 , 10 billion light years old , and that &apos;s not the case .
And if you &apos;re a little bit more likely to be able to get smaller and smaller , you know how much it is .
So , if it isn &apos;t properly properly properly , you can see that it &apos;s very close .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; After all , I &apos;m going to ask him to call it &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t know that I was very worried about it , so I didn &apos;t know that I was very disappointed .
I was <unk> . He wrote a <unk> .
And I &apos;m not going to do that .
( Music ) ( Music ends ) We &apos;ve got a billion light years of the visible universe of the universe .
You can have a share of your life , but this is the closest you can do .
And so on and so on and so forth , we &apos;ve always been able to get rid of our lives together .
( Laughter ) Right ?
( Applause )
In the 1960s , in the 1960s , in the 1960s , when you have <unk> <unk> , you had to <unk> him .
It was <unk> <unk> that I had written a <unk> .
Now , the government knew that all the papers knew .
This is a piece of paper that led to a piece of paper , which is a piece of paper that I couldn &apos;t find .
And if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do with a rug , we &apos;ve been trained as a big <unk> .
I didn &apos;t let it go .
But in 2009 , in 2009 , any famous brand is a laser — ( Applause ) ( Applause ) If you &apos;re not going to be able to take it , you can see if you &apos;re not going to be able to see it , you can see if you &apos;re not going to be able to put it in your hand , you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of color , and that &apos;s where you can see the yellow dots in order to be able to see the yellow dots .
This is <unk> .
Nobody knows it .
This is a <unk> technology that we can &apos;t use in technology to do with our technology .
This is the problem for three main online websites .
And if you look at the literature , you can see that we &apos;re going to go online , and then you can see that we &apos;re going to go online .
This is the three key elements of this puzzle .
First , online .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And online , it &apos;s not hard to understand if it &apos;s not hard to solve .
These guys were saving money .
Many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many
Actually , online , <unk> <unk> , <unk> people .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is Alfred .
This is the Stephen watts .
This is <unk> .
This is Matthew and <unk> <unk> .
These guys are online online , but they &apos;ve been able to use it in ways that they would use it , and they use it in the way that they &apos;re going to go online , and if we &apos;re going to use it online , they use some of these things , or if we don &apos;t want them to go , and if we don &apos;t know , if we &apos;re going to have a tool online , then I don &apos;t know if they &apos;re going to be able to take care of your parents
So two months ago , the U.S. , the U.S. , the President of the U.S. , was called &quot; &quot; Sam <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> million years ago .
Nobody knows what &apos;s going on .
I think that this day is larger than the real world , which is more than the real world .
And it seems to be more likely to say that if you &apos;re going to tell you , you don &apos;t even know .
It was a <unk> online , <unk> <unk> .
The second thing that happens is not a lot of money , but it &apos;s not a lot of money .
It &apos;s going to be able to tell us that when we think about it , it can be a sense of ideas that we can &apos;t understand .
Anonymous , in fact , in the last year , for the last year , and online , I &apos;m not going to be able to live in the first place .
Three of my favorites : these are the things that are happening in order to make this work in order to make this work , as Anonymous , as Anonymous , as Anonymous , and the third source of power , state and education .
Let &apos;s look at what we call <unk> .
This is the obvious amount of what I &apos;m trying to sneak on with our expectations .
<unk> <unk> <unk> — more or more .
Over the past year , online , we went back to <unk> <unk> .
The whole system doesn &apos;t make the whole system .
And last week , I was asked about the governments in the world , asking for this question , what I &apos;d like to tell you about , why I asked them to tell the story that I could tell you , why don &apos;t I think that it &apos;s a human being saved .
He said .
How would people die like this ?
We need to go online online .
Here are the <unk> lines .
What do they do ?
If you have a tendency to solve the problem , and if you don &apos;t want to use it , you need to be able to use it to be able to use it .
We &apos;ve been able to use it to be able to use drugs , or in other ways , in the poorer countries , and as many as we &apos;ve been talking like Iran , we &apos;ve been able to use more than the other people in the country , because they don &apos;t have a lot more than their foreign governments , because they don &apos;t believe that the indigenous people don &apos;t have access to the local government .
But they don &apos;t think that they &apos;re going to call the outside of the outside .
It &apos;s possible to get rid of our lives .
That was the end of the day .
How do you feel like the Arabic Spring and the <unk> ?
In fact , in 2011 , 2011 , 2011 , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Between this <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been able to do in this room , and I had a tendency to go through the stratosphere to make all of all of the bonds in my body , and I had a tendency to go down and see if all of all of these networks are going on .
This is our ability to get rid of the atmospheres of these networks .
I &apos;m not going to live here .
It turns out that the Western world is able to make sure that the Western civilization takes place in the future .
But Western <unk> do it .
For example , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , I called the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> by the German Germans , which are made by <unk> .
You can &apos;t believe that if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t see your phone .
Now , here we are .
The Internet is going on .
You know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , you know , you know , online , you know , online , you know , online , you know , you don &apos;t know .
Now , when you &apos;re talking about it , there &apos;s a number of great probability that says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a good job but not a good job .
Why am I worried ?
I don &apos;t know anything secret . &quot; &quot; But this is a very good idea .
It &apos;s <unk> .
Not <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t depend on the way that the security between and the <unk> .
It depends on the way between and control .
And this is what we call <unk> , and this is what we call <unk> , and this is what we call <unk> .
But if you don &apos;t think about it , like 50 years from the next 50 years , you can imagine that if you don &apos;t think about it ?
And this is the question and the question that we &apos;re going to get over 50 years in the future .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you , thank you . &quot; &quot; Because I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you .
And this is the first step in Washington DC , and this is the first step in Washington , D.C.
My friends and my friends told me , I don &apos;t know .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to be here . &quot; &quot; My mother said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to be here . &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine the behavior of 17 years old , and you can imagine the behavior of this kind of thing .
And my father said to me , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Applause )
We don &apos;t know , because they came from , because they came from , where they came from .
When I was in 17 years old , I said , &quot; God , my God , is my God ? &quot;
And then I started to deal with that .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s what we call <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to take the <unk> of the <unk> .
And yet , we don &apos;t know that this is the whole thing .
I mean , I want to think about what I &apos;m going to be able to do , and I want to tell you about my own stories .
In fact , in the 21st century , I &apos;ve seen two oil farms under the Golden Gate Bridge in the Golden Gate Bridge , which is when I was born in the Golden Gate Bridge .
I decided that I was so proud that I was able to use my <unk> <unk> .
This is a big thing for California .
And it was also a big thing to find out if I was living in <unk> , and it was also a big thing to get rid of 350 , 350 people in the middle of the year .
And I started out here in my apartment , and I was able to figure out what was happening , people — what I thought was ...
They said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do with you ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to do this for the rest of your mind .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make us feel bad for you . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do with you . &quot; &quot; I thought , people don &apos;t believe me .
Because I don &apos;t know , because we don &apos;t care about everyone else .
And I was talking about the people who are connected to people who are connected to people .
And I put it in the box .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to use it , &quot; &quot; and my father said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you get this like 16 years old ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know anything about the race between the past ?
They &apos;re in Philadelphia .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t know how much it is , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you don &apos;t need it , you don &apos;t need to do this . &quot;
So , I decided to have my niece <unk> , which is — I decided I had a lot of <unk> and very <unk> — I decided to say , &quot; &quot; I want a daily life .
So I did this .
And in the morning , I was in the middle of the morning .
And I mean , this is a wonderful experience for me , because I began to make this as much as possible .
And he decided to think about me .
Because I was always curious , because I &apos;ve always figured out how to tell people that they want to talk about people , that they want to talk about what they want to talk about .
And people talk about them , and they talk about them , and they talk about what they &apos;re talking about .
And then ...
And so it turns out that we can start to communicate .
And that day , I was really worried about that .
And that &apos;s because it was because I didn &apos;t know anything about it , because I didn &apos;t know anything .
I was 27 years old , and I thought , I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , in order to do this next day , and then , again , again , and this time , I &apos;ve talked about this time . I &apos;ve talked about it , because I &apos;ve got a lot of people to learn , because I don &apos;t need it .
So , a year ago , I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to talk about some of the things that I &apos;m talking about . &quot; &quot; So I thought , maybe I don &apos;t want to speak again .
But it &apos;s not about 17 years old .
And I was also trying to find myself in this 17 years , and I was also trying to find myself in my life , and I was also trying to find myself in my class , and I was trying to learn to learn how to read books .
And I thought , well , I need education .
And I went to Oregon , and I went to Oregon , and I went to Oregon .
It &apos;s 800 km .
What did I go from ? &quot; &quot; What ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Ah , what do you want to read here ?
<unk> ...
We have a special tendency to tell you .
And after two years , I was in the middle of Sierra Leone .
My father came . He came to me with me .
He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; but we don &apos;t know what to do with our daughters , but we don &apos;t know how to do that .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get it , you know , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not going to be able to rely on <unk> , I don &apos;t rely on <unk> .
And I went to Washington , D.C. , D.C. , where I came back to Washington , D.C. , where I went to Washington , D.C.
And two years ago , in Montana , in Montana , in the Montana world , and I &apos;ve been in Montana , and I &apos;m not going to give you a lot of <unk> , and I didn &apos;t believe that in Montana .
Two years here would be bad news .
( Laughter ) And so , I &apos;ve got two years of education . I &apos;ve been trained in two years .
There are two stories in Montana .
That &apos;s the first thing that I &apos;ve experienced when I opened it up .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be worried about this , &quot; &quot; and they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back in the morning . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that for a lecture .
Do you go to South Africa , and I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what — you know , <unk> , South America .
So I did this .
He said to me , he said to me , &quot; &quot; Okay , John , John , for a lecture for a lecture , &quot; &quot; I can use my office as a student , and you can use it as a student .
And so , I &apos;m hoping that all of you will let me go back to the supermarket , which is that all of our dreams are allowed to take place .
But if you don &apos;t think about it , and you &apos;re not going to deal with it , you &apos;re not going to solve the problem , and then you &apos;re not going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
They had to help me to help me .
And I &apos;m not going to tell you that there &apos;s a lot of things that can interact with the environment , and that &apos;s going on to me .
This is what I &apos;ve been talking about , instead of <unk> .
I was 13 years old , 13 years old .
And my friend asked them to deal with them , my friend John <unk> : The name of my name , John <unk> , said to them , &quot; John <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the last one .
There are all sorts of ways that we don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to know if I was going to sleep on the couch .
But I didn &apos;t know what he &apos;s like .
After two months , everybody worked on our <unk> .
And I learned a lot about this and I learned a lot about this .
And what I &apos;m saying is , John &apos;s trying to figure out what I do — I don &apos;t know what I think — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , that &apos;s the tree of the tree .
No , no . That &apos;s not — it &apos;s not — it &apos;s not — it &apos;s not .
Do I want to do with you .
You can do it .
No , no matter what he heard .
So this is the debate that we &apos;ve been talking about .
I &apos;m going to go back to this audience and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
But what I did was something I learned when I was thinking about , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And then I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do .
And I thought , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re not good .
So I kept working .
And my father said to my father , and my father said to me , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing . &quot; &quot; And my father said , &quot; &quot; You know , we don &apos;t wake up . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
What do you want to do with your colleagues ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s about two years old , which is about two years ago .
Nobody knows that selling oil .
But it did something — Exxon Valdez .
And I was the only guy who wrote about oil spills in the United States .
And my father came .
He said , &quot; &quot; My son can &apos;t understand how it &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t use it .
He said , &quot; &quot; You need to tell you that you don &apos;t want to tell you , because , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do better , because you &apos;re going to go on your shoulder . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I had to go back .
And I was able to find out , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I began to find out on my journey that I could find out on the floor of my life .
And in fact , if you don &apos;t want to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to find it , it &apos;s not the sound that you &apos;re talking about , but it &apos;s not the sound that you &apos;re talking about .
And I &apos;d like to thank you , because they don &apos;t know me , because they don &apos;t know me .
And that &apos;s what we can do .
And they came back to me , and they told me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to tell me that I &apos;m going to tell you .
And that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going on — and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do .
And we need a lot of important — we need it .
He goes .
My father said , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not going to do this .
You know , when I was on the coast of Manhattan , I didn &apos;t know that when I was on the coast of Manhattan , I didn &apos;t know that I was going to <unk> the coast .
We don &apos;t solve the rules for the United States — in the middle of oil .
20 years ago , if someone said to me , &quot; John , John , if you want to do a restaurant ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I want to go . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead . &quot; &quot; And then I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m a golfer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Man : You know , you want to go .
What if that &apos;s what happens ? How ?
What do you want to do if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know how simple you are ?
The coast of Manhattan is beautiful <unk> .
And after that — I said , there was only a year in this — I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m just a year ago , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go on this job . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I
The key question is — I want to tell you why I &apos;m going to tell you why I want to talk to you .
I began to talk to the story , and I started talking to the other of our minds .
Now , in this context , we had to contribute to the environment that we need to contribute to our society .
And if you don &apos;t know — people were talking about people , and we don &apos;t talk about it .
It doesn &apos;t matter if we don &apos;t want to tell each other , but we don &apos;t want to tell each other , but we don &apos;t want to see each other .
And if we &apos;re thinking about our environment , we &apos;re looking at our minds and we &apos;re looking at each other with each other .
And that was the equivalent I wanted to get to the floor .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be able to do this . &quot; &quot; This was my daughter , and I went on , and I went on .
This is the story of the story , and I realized that I &apos;m not going to get there anymore .
This was the <unk> — I &apos;ve got this known , <unk> prison , and I didn &apos;t know what happened to me , and I didn &apos;t know what happened to me because I didn &apos;t know anything .
He told me , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ?
I don &apos;t have to show you what I had to do with you .
I <unk> the GMT — the doctor and I went around the world .
What did he do with that ?
And the way we negotiate the path came back .
I didn &apos;t know .
So what am I saying thank God I &apos;m listening to my God and God ?
And then I went to 150 miles away from 150 miles away , and I realized that I didn &apos;t believe that I was going on .
I was in my apartment , and I was on the floor .
I didn &apos;t know that I was in my neighborhood where I was in my neighborhood .
How do you get ?
Because when I started to start using my devices , I &apos;m not going to be able to use it .
But the difference is that I don &apos;t have any title , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;ve never been able to use it .
And I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that the GMT will be rejuvenated .
The professor <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so I realized that I just had other other stories , and I &apos;m not just about myself .
You know , we can do that .
I had to change myself .
You don &apos;t know , because you don &apos;t know , because you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re always going to make it happen .
Because I don &apos;t want to go to jail .
I didn &apos;t know who I was .
But I could know that this is required .
I didn &apos;t know , because this is the only way that we &apos;re going to live here today .
And I know , a lot of time we &apos;ve always wanted to survive , but there are other places where we always want to stay .
And we don &apos;t know that if we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to have new ideas that we &apos;ve already had , we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to have new possibilities .
And I &apos;d like to ask for the next place to go to the next place — that &apos;s where you can see , where you can see that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get out there , which is to go back to where you are , and that day , we have to understand that this path .
We are now .
We need to tell the story about the past and the past .
And if I tell you , what I &apos;m going to tell you is , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m talking about , if I &apos;m here that I &apos;m here .
I know , I know , I &apos;m going to tell you , you can &apos;t see me .
Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; You know , if you &apos;re not going to get the world out of the world , if you &apos;re going to get rid of the world , like this , you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the world at TED . &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you that we &apos;re not going to see each other .
Because it &apos;s because of our collective environment and our collective sense of connection to our collective environment .
So I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;m going to point out here , and I &apos;d like to end with the age of five .
Thank you .

You know , if you &apos;re a believer in America , you &apos;re going to ask you if you &apos;re an economist , and you ask the question , &quot; If you don &apos;t want to tell you , this is your name ? &quot;
And you can say , &quot; &quot; This is the <unk> , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we call <unk> .
This is <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m a good , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Oh , why is that ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> , why is that ? &quot;
They have names of names , blocks , just <unk> to <unk> , &quot; &quot; that , you know , I &apos;m a little depressed and you &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
Now let &apos;s imagine that if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you know , if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re not going to tell the man that you &apos;re saying , &quot; You don &apos;t believe that ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This is the block of block and <unk> , &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you write ? &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; Well , we don &apos;t have the names of the name name . &quot;
They have names .
Look at Google chips . There are 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 18 , 18 , 18 .
All of these <unk> names have names on the floor , which is between the blocks .
And you can say , &quot; &quot; Well , why are you going to make your home ? &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s easy . That &apos;s what you can do with your house .
And this is the block of the block of the blockchain , one of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , when you &apos;re a member of your house , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; which says , &quot; &quot; Of course , they &apos;re going to go . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Of course , they &apos;re going .
The first home we &apos;re going to get rid of the first home of the pyramid .
After that , I didn &apos;t believe that when I was born .
This is <unk> . It &apos;s true , and it &apos;s clear . &quot; &quot; Sometimes I have a lot of fun to see if we don &apos;t think about it , that we &apos;re never going to be able to see that we &apos;re not going to be able to understand it .
For example , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re going to be able to do the work that they can do .
And when you &apos;re in the months you &apos;re not going to spend it in the months , and if you &apos;re not going to get rid of it , because they don &apos;t have any money , because they don &apos;t believe that if they &apos;re sick , they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) We &apos;re not going to take a &quot; &quot; eureka . &quot; &quot; One , two , three .
But you know , Africa is a piece of &quot; &quot; a piece of music , &quot; &quot; a piece of &quot; &quot; a piece of music , &quot; &quot; which is the end of a physicist .
So , you know , it &apos;s not just that you don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s two , three , three , four , one .
And that map is true .
( Laughter ) There is this phrase that you have to say , you know , if you have anything flat about India .
So , if you don &apos;t know , if you &apos;re going on and elsewhere or elsewhere , and if you have a great deal , it can be true .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . ( Applause )
