And I was 11 years old , and in the corner of the corner , I &apos;d like to tell you about the fact that if you were 11 years old .
My father was listening to the BBC of a young boy .
We had a career that we didn &apos;t know at the time , because I couldn &apos;t tell you , because I couldn &apos;t do it .
&quot; &quot; Save the Taliban ! &quot; &quot; — my father was my father .
I didn &apos;t know what it was to do , but I could tell you about what it was .
&quot; &quot; Now , if you can go to school and say , &quot; &quot; Now you can go to school . &quot;
Have you ever heard it in the morning .
They go into the school .
I was six years old when the Taliban broke out , and I was six years old .
So , in five years , in the next five years , I &apos;ve spent five years trying to go out to a secret school , trying to go to a secret school .
And that was the only way we had to get to education .
Every day in a different way , I don &apos;t know who &apos;s going on a different way .
You don &apos;t see the market in the market , and you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to be able to live in the market .
In the school of a house , there was a home in the school , and in a small way , there was a little bit of <unk> .
It was comfortable when he was comfortable , but he would be warm on the beach .
We knew we were going to be able to get rid of the <unk> , and we were all worried about our lives .
Sometimes , for the Taliban , for the Taliban , for the Taliban , in school .
And what I &apos;ve always been saying is , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
My father ?
What do we live in ?
And yet , there was a place where we wanted to be a school .
I was actually very lucky , and in fact , I was very lucky , and I had a career in a family of mine .
My father was a human being a man .
They have a different kind of vision , a different kind of person who has a living , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and even more than that .
But my mother had a teacher school .
<unk> .
Two years ago , two years ago , there was a school for girls and boys and women .
And my father — this is — this is the first time I had an education school .
And in fact , when I got involved , he had no education in her school , but he didn &apos;t have the Taliban , but despite the Taliban , the Taliban were <unk> .
For her , she was more engaged in education .
It would be the Taliban , the Taliban , and it would be in time , and it would happen in time , and it would always be a flash of light .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d like to do . &quot; &quot; And my father said , &quot; &quot; You know , you can do it , you can do it , you can do anything .
You can &apos;t see it . You can do it in war . You can go home .
But the only thing that we &apos;ve been thinking about is the fact that if you don &apos;t know the only thing that happens , and if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to spend on the school , you can see that when you get to the school , you get to the school , you get to the school .
Now , I &apos;m not going to continue to continue yet ? &quot; &quot; This day is 22 .
I grew up in a country where I grew up in a country where I grew up .
There are six percent of those who have been trained in middle school , and if you don &apos;t have the middle school , and if you don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to do it .
So , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to make a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) I couldn &apos;t tell you , I had to tell you that when I was in the middle school , one of my favorites was my father was my father , and my father was my father in exile .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m the first woman in Kabul , but I &apos;m also the first woman in Kabul .
( Applause ) I believe it .
And we have the Great <unk> , which is much bigger for me .
So , in fact , in a global ethic of women called <unk> in women &apos;s education .
That &apos;s why women are still risky to the school in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan .
And that &apos;s the most important thing I &apos;ve ever learned , which is the study of students who are going to take care of the <unk> .
And I think that the fate of our grandparents , their grandparents , who are not all violence , but they know how to deal with them .
It &apos;s like , you know , I don &apos;t see it . I &apos;m going to tell you , and I don &apos;t see the real name and the real name .
About a month ago , a month ago , a couple of minutes later , <unk> <unk> , which was a few minutes away from the captain of the road .
He ran home , and he played the phone , and the sound of my mother would go to the school , and the voice would continue to keep him alive .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m not going to stop it , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to tell you . &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to tell you . &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to tell you . &quot; &quot; And then what I discovered
That &apos;s what I don &apos;t know if we don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> .
In fact , when the ancestors were brilliant , they didn &apos;t know if they were brilliant , but they didn &apos;t know if they were like , &quot; &quot; You know , the father of men . &quot;
The Taliban go to the school in the school where the Taliban go to school in the middle of the school — like , you know , this is going on .
And here , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , there are schools in three million places .
( Applause ) <unk> are very different from the United States .
We don &apos;t believe that the Americans don &apos;t believe that they don &apos;t .
This changes that change the U.S. military , and then they &apos;re going to be very long .
But I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about in school , and we can see that when I &apos;ve been involved in school , and we can see that when we can see it , it &apos;s a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to take care of it .
For me , I was able to tell you about the <unk> and the <unk> , and the girls who went on to me , and the girls who went to me .
And they &apos;re kind of like me , as I am .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to take care of our lives . &quot; &quot; And everyone who has these cute hope is that you can go down and down for about two hours .
And you can see here that you &apos;re going to be able to sit here in the middle , and you &apos;re not going to be able to see it , but it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And this is cute . And finally .
<unk> design .
It &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s everywhere .
This is the unknown world .
I was underwater , underwater .
It &apos;s a place where we &apos;re going to take a place in front of you , and in the background , and in the background .
Now , the female sees that the female &apos;s only more than her face .
Let &apos;s go back to a time . Watch it : the net on the right is the net .
A step back to a step back , and you &apos;re going to take a step back .
<unk> . I love it . This is a great deal .
Watch it . You get them . You get it . You get it out of a lot like seaweed .
We don &apos;t know .
This is the diameter of the rock game , which is a lot of new things .
And a joke . Isn &apos;t that incredible ? Now , Roger Eliot .
And it &apos;s a blend of <unk> , which is &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
And then the best thing is possible when it &apos;s possible .
It makes it . It &apos;s coming back .
One . Two . Three .
<unk> , Kim Jong-Il , who said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know who you are .
All right .
If we could see the first person in the first community , we could see if we could see the first one .
And I didn &apos;t know any time .
And now , I &apos;m going to show you now .
So , if you don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s different from China .
It &apos;s a part of the puzzle .
( Applause ) You know , if you like , North Carolina .
They &apos;re not going to go back to the 2008 menu .
And I and I , I know , thank you .
Every single thing I &apos;m talking about is , I don &apos;t know anything about anything .
And the question is , you can &apos;t answer questions .
A police worker a police worker .
But most of them are the Chinese police officer .
And when I was very lucky , I was very lucky , and I was very lucky to have a very lucky list .
A new language in a new language , and then , after all , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to make a job .
It was South South Asia .
We were all born , but in 67 years old , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Whether it &apos;s South Asia ?
So I started thinking about how to save them .
It was the right path across the North Sea .
I didn &apos;t believe in China .
We &apos;re going to stand up and stand up .
We don &apos;t know if we don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) But then , you know , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
I &apos;m very sorry , but I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you that in South South Asia .
Nobody I met .
I &apos;ve made it that I &apos;ve been able to tell you that , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to spend a lot of money on the ground , and you &apos;re not going to spend a lot of time on your team .
That was my grandfather &apos;s life .
They &apos;re very little fliers , and they don &apos;t know if they &apos;re going to die .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry at TED .
This is what we &apos;ve been doing in 1958 .
We can &apos;t make it out of the <unk> .
You can go back to the building of the building .
You know , kids don &apos;t know that kids are very good .
It looks like this .
Why not ?
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be ashamed of my grandmother . &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you get rid of your mind ?
My kids don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you need to be one of them . &quot;
And we &apos;ve made it all around me , but we &apos;ve made it all around .
There are three mirrors in the building .
This is what we call <unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s used to be able to do something else .
They &apos;re not going to put it together .
Their kids don &apos;t care .
( Laughter ) Sometimes I &apos;m going to run out of a tree with a tree with a tree .
The black tree you see that the boy is so much like that .
( Laughter ) Every one of a sudden , they &apos;re going to sit in the details , they &apos;re sitting behind .
This is pretty cute .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m sorry .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , we &apos;ve been able to make it possible , because we don &apos;t have kids , not just under alone , but we want to see .
The key is , you can see the ceiling and the ceiling .
And that &apos;s where it is — there &apos;s all kinds of water — there &apos;s all kinds of water .
You can see the agile truck of the agile truck , you can see , you know , you can &apos;t see it . You can &apos;t see it .
But you can &apos;t see the boy in the middle of the box , and you don &apos;t see them with water .
( Laughter ) It turns out that it &apos;s always open to the end of the year .
You don &apos;t know anything , and you don &apos;t know anything .
And that means that , in fact , it &apos;s made from the bottom line .
You don &apos;t know that there &apos;s not .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
Most of the kids who are kids who are kids who are kids don &apos;t care .
But that doesn &apos;t have any implications .
Because there &apos;s no excuse for anyone .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you &apos;re going to be in the middle of the room , if you &apos;re in the middle of the room , you can go to sleep .
You know , I &apos;m not going to go back , where you &apos;re going to go .
( Laughter ) I mean , I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know if kids don &apos;t know .
And then they go back and forth again .
And that &apos;s natural .
Secondly , we &apos;re thinking about a very important thing to happen .
You know , kids don &apos;t get better .
So , you know , you can see it .
My kids are high school when kids are high school .
You know , if you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t get rid of your mouth .
They need to sound .
And you know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to tell you .
We need to be able to fight .
You know , when it comes to work , we &apos;re trying to do everything .
This is okay .
We know that we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> , and we know that we can go back to the <unk> .
And then we go back to the table .
It &apos;s 50 degrees Fahrenheit .
Water froze .
We don &apos;t know .
So , you know , I &apos;m not going to be ashamed .
So , we &apos;ve got this kind of thing .
And they work out here .
In fact , it &apos;s helping us .
But they don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) This is a little bit of the story of the child .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
This is the opposite .
There are good chairs .
We have <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s trying to take care of what &apos;s going on in our lives .
( Laughter ) More <unk> . ( Laughter )
In every classroom , there is no excuse for anyone , no doubt .
This is from the <unk> of Santa Fe .
And this is the same thing that we &apos;ve built , which is the same as we &apos;re building it .
They have five yards away , and they have seven meters .
Because there are so many people who don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t have the idea .
We didn &apos;t take a girl to make a girl .
They &apos;re trying to take care of them .
You can &apos;t see it .
You don &apos;t know , but you don &apos;t know .
<unk> . He was my father .
( Laughter ) This is what it &apos;s like , you know how much warm it is .
And then , you know , you get sick .
You know , you know , you &apos;re very lucky .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s trying to learn about how it works .
And when I have a little bit of time , we need to take care of them .
They &apos;re going to be able to work together .
This is a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to have these kinds of opportunities .
This is a picture of a boy who has to move on to a kid who &apos;s a boy .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
Not so little .
So , this little morning , this little morning , and so on .
But we haven &apos;t been able to do it .
These kids are moving 200 yards into the middle of the middle of the classroom .
My kids are the highest athletic expectations between kids .
He &apos;s always saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know them . I don &apos;t know them .
You can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know .
Now , I think that we don &apos;t have to give them control and we don &apos;t need to participate .
We don &apos;t know if we don &apos;t know .
Because it turns out that this is how we live in life .
We don &apos;t know that the world &apos;s going to change the world &apos;s world and people .
This building is one of our lives , which is one of our lives .
Thank you .

1970 , in 1970 , in the 1970s , in China , two years ago , I was born .
In the first grade , I had spent all the time in my first grade , and I had spent all the time in the community .
But the lion said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And my father said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No .
After all , it was a <unk> event , which was the only way she had a good job , and he was the only way to make it safe .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
But my dream was to be in China .
This is what I call <unk> <unk> .
I need to be working with young people who are young in the old age of opera , and I tried to make my opera work .
And in fact , I wrote a letter to the radio store , and I had a letter to try .
But I didn &apos;t get my idea of my mind .
Nobody believed .
But my friends would be interested in me , and they were friends like me .
So I started to deal with my age 15 years old .
I didn &apos;t have any time .
And in the middle class , in the middle class , the only way that we had was a single country in the middle grade .
But that was the case .
And then we decided to take a way .
There are no people who tell me that ? No .
I did what I did .
What I did was I took this book by <unk> <unk> , which was written by me , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I had to give you a model of the fact that I didn &apos;t want to put my hands on my blog , &quot; &quot; More cheap . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I &apos;ve learned to be able to make a <unk> version of that .
&#91; &quot; &quot; My Outsourced Life &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; In <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; What do you know ?
And of course , I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to put it in my pocket .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> life .
You don &apos;t have any use of any use . You know .
It &apos;s fascinating .
( Laughter ) This is another day .
But the fifth day , my fifth son said , &quot; &quot; Dad , my father and I are the honor of honor . &quot;
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And in this way , I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk a little bit differently when I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> .
He also gave me the opportunity to compare it to me .
That &apos;s what you can do .
For example , this map seemed strange to me , because it seemed to me that we didn &apos;t know that this map didn &apos;t work .
Nobody knows that China isn &apos;t going to be in the middle of China .
Actually , the map shows the map of the map .
It &apos;s not a new thing .
This is a standard model in the science world .
And even in fact , there &apos;s also the science of science , and there &apos;s also a lot of science in science .
<unk> and <unk> are helping us complete <unk> .
So , I &apos;m sorry , we &apos;ve got to work on the work that we &apos;re trying to study , why do we live in everyday life ?
So , I began to get back to the <unk> .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John Adams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John Adams said , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s about friends . &quot;
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; Graham <unk> , Warren Buffett and <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I wrote a story in Alice . ( Laughter )
For Jesus Christ , these are economic , political and political .
It &apos;s fascinating , it &apos;s all important , but it &apos;s all we &apos;ve been able to do , and we &apos;re not in the social sciences .
It &apos;s also fascinating to read about the two language of two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> Road Road . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; <unk> : Thomas <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I was saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the water . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;ve experienced something else .
For example , I started to deal with the people who were in the middle of China in Chinese in China .
In China , the word &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; in China .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time talking about the past and present with people who are connected to people .
I can &apos;t even see a little bit about whether or not I could .
The other people can &apos;t afford the size of the other people .
And when we are beginning , it &apos;s not the single definition of desire .
The fundamental idea is that the fundamental principle that we can relate to the fundamental principle is that we are connected to each other .
<unk> desire .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m not going to talk about it today , and it &apos;s very time-consuming .
And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , thank you always ! &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
If you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know that , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to get rid of your mouth .
Just go .
You don &apos;t know about the data .
Today we &apos;re working today .
You can &apos;t do it . You know what ?
And so when I was in front of my work and said , &quot; &quot; Why am I ? &quot; &quot; Okay , now , I &apos;m going to go on the day and say , &quot; &quot; Why am I ? &quot; &quot; And then , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to tell you , you know , I &apos;m going to tell you about this .
This is what I call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how good it is . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , if you don &apos;t know how good people are .
And when I was office , I didn &apos;t know much more about the office .
<unk> , you don &apos;t .
Well , I believe that in fact , in fact , in a new way , in fact , in fact , there is a new age , which is why we don &apos;t know why .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Applause )
<unk> — beep , click , click , click , click , click . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s important , right ?
We don &apos;t know every aspect of it .
And they &apos;re really going to be able to be able to be able to go ahead and make the difference .
But in the last few years , in the last couple of years , we &apos;ve been able to grow up and spread across the atmosphere .
<unk> . ( Laughter ) Now , this is why this man doesn &apos;t know if he &apos;s good at this man , but it &apos;s the reason that this man is not good at all .
And in fact , I have a tendency to think about the global commons .
That &apos;s what I did .
So a few years ago , I got a video clip , which you can see in this video .
This is a little bit of what we hate to hate the video from five minutes .
We don &apos;t know if we can manage to manage control .
They don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying .
And let me leave with everyone else .
We don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look forward .
( Video ) Narrator : I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you a very important story .
For a bunch of words , who would be a bunch of people who would say , &quot; &quot; Who are you ?
<unk> , <unk> . I &apos;m going to live today .
( Laughter ) <unk> Joe . Thank you , thank you .
We &apos;ve got a lot of people who we want to write , and that &apos;s what we want to do , and that &apos;s what we need .
In a bunch of words — <unk> — ( Laughter ) — you know ?
No ? I had to tell you .
All right , come to me .
And a few weeks later , a few weeks later , tens of thousands of countries have spent over tens of thousands of countries , really tens of countries .
And three years later , this video comes from every month .
If this is an image of view and the video of the video , this is the image of the video .
And I started to find out that I didn &apos;t know what was going on .
I &apos;ve been able to find a useful job to find a useful job .
And I started with a colleague of mine , and I started with a colleague of mine , and I would say , &quot; &quot; You know what &apos;s going on with that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , you know what they &apos;re doing .
And in the middle of the middle class , the middle of the middle is a black hole in the middle of the middle .
( Laughter )
Well , at first time , they were at the moment .
And even if you &apos;re aware of the people who don &apos;t even understand the people who don &apos;t know .
One is one of the simplest elements .
But what I did is , in fact , <unk> <unk> , which is not entirely <unk> .
It &apos;s the last week in the past century .
It &apos;s a <unk> understanding of the human condition .
We don &apos;t know whether we &apos;re going to take care of each other , but we don &apos;t want to be able to take care of each other .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause )
This is a scientific endeavor that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a way that people can help make themselves better .
It could cause .
( Laughter )
It &apos;s more than a human being in the human body .
( Laughter ) You know , if you don &apos;t have a lot of shoes , you don &apos;t know whether or don &apos;t you have a lot of shoes , or if you don &apos;t have a lot of calories , or you &apos;re in the middle of a city , or you don &apos;t have a lot of shoes .
I couldn &apos;t believe it . I couldn &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
We &apos;re not going to be able to understand the challenges that we &apos;re going to be in , and we don &apos;t understand the claims , but these are the concepts that are associated with science , the sciences , the sciences , the sciences , the sciences , the sciences , the science , the science , the science , the science fiction , like this .
And in the last time , I had to go back to the last time , and I had a lot to do with it .
Some of them will be able to tell us that they don &apos;t understand us .
But let &apos;s say , well , there &apos;s a lot of things that we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t know if we &apos;re going to get rid of the police , and we don &apos;t get them to see them . We don &apos;t get rid of them . We want to change the way we want it .
So let me show you that I &apos;m going to show you .
We can &apos;t read it . We &apos;ve got it for the invention of NBC .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; 2,000 <unk> . &quot;
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve been able to do this with 900 dollars in school .
It &apos;s a plastic thing that you can &apos;t see in the middle of your chest .
Now , you can do it for a lot of things . But this is what we &apos;ve done with students who are trained in college .
( Laughter ) So this works like this : I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that if you &apos;re going to sit on the table , you &apos;re not going to sit on the floor .
That &apos;s something like this .
So I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m sorry . This is a little bit of right .
So we &apos;ve been able to compare it again to science .
So , you know , this is the beach .
( Laughter ) Thank you , Mr. Teszler . I &apos;m sorry .
Of course , the question is , the question is : What do you find in this instrument ?
And the answer is : you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of the <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) Not just because you don &apos;t just play it .
Now , if you &apos;re going to be able to tell you that you &apos;re going to be able to tell you that , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , you &apos;re using it .
People don &apos;t believe it ; they don &apos;t stop .
We &apos;re going to take all the things together . We &apos;re going to compare all the things we can do .
Here we did .
We took two of these two <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and one of them was hollow .
And over 50 percent of the time was successful . ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m not going to get rid of it .
This is a curious , curious example of what we &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s a little months old in &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Every time it happens , it becomes a <unk> .
This is the future we can &apos;t predict the future .
People don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t ?
So I &apos;ve got some idea that I &apos;m talking about this , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about , and that &apos;s what people are saying .
In every decade , the average IQ number three years .
It &apos;s fascinating .
Whether it &apos;s a science or a scientific material .
<unk> and religion ?
This is like <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These are two different points .
It &apos;s not because we don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m not going to tell you about it .
It &apos;s a way to make all of our senses for all .
What do you say to you ? &quot; &quot; You can tell me , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do for this ? &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
Have someone called this &quot; &quot; Photoshop &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Photoshop . &quot;
And the question is , the question is , the question is , is it more real .
We &apos;ve got to be able to tell the story that we don &apos;t know about it , but we have to be able to make sure that we don &apos;t .
Have you ever been able to make it more real ? What do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; The World Rights News Show News &quot; &quot; ?
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Now , these are the things I &apos;m going to say , Sydney <unk> .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; And then you have a great deal .
And I think you &apos;re going to be able to tell you better than the second story . &quot; &quot; This is all intelligent designing all intelligent designs .
That &apos;s what I do .
( Applause ) You can tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; But that doesn &apos;t make any sense . It &apos;s an idea .
It doesn &apos;t happen .
This is the <unk> design for the design of design .
Now , the scientists sometimes say , &quot; &quot; You know , when you think about the dark energy , the kind of dark energy , like the dark matter , the kind of dark energy , like the dark matter .
This is the story for science , for science .
This is the last one to design design , and this is the last one .
Now , the same question is : What do you make ?
You don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t like it , or you don &apos;t know whether you &apos;re going to die ?
This is my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Like , if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know .
No , it &apos;s not &quot; &quot; Photoshop , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a high-tech technology .
This is what I call &quot; &quot; Kodak <unk> . &quot;
Somebody else will be ready for anyone else .
The camera is ready — it &apos;s like .
( Laughter ) You can think of these things that are real , and if you don &apos;t know , you might think that there &apos;s real real estate , but it &apos;s not really important .
It was more common , and it &apos;s always going to happen between the <unk> and the <unk> .
For example , we &apos;ve got two problems that have two problems in our lives .
First of all , I didn &apos;t have any trouble talking about <unk> .
Secondly , it was <unk> , and so on and so forth , and so on , I couldn &apos;t tell you about what we did .
And he wrote this kind of thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve made this kind of <unk> planet on the planet . &quot;
That &apos;s what we decided to do .
So , if you don &apos;t have a good job , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re good enough to be able to make a good job .
This is what I call <unk> .
This is a kind of a book where people who are able to deal with those who are able to deal with those who are able to take care of themselves .
Now , these two things were made , and we had a good deal about the solar system , and the solar system had a great deal about the solar system . And so , in fact , the Kepler has been able to fly faster and faster and so on .
We knew that we could see the telescope on this telescope .
And that &apos;s what I did .
The bad news is that it &apos;s all about science fiction .
One of the things that I had to do was tell you that there was only one thing that I had to do , and then I was really worried about it .
We &apos;ve made it all over the place .
This is <unk> .
At the same time in the year 2000 , I was able to tell you that the same place in the late 1990s , people thought that this would be a <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture in 1958 .
You can do it with your hands , and then you can do it .
We don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it . You know , you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the <unk> .
You don &apos;t know that you &apos;re going to be able to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be able to do it , because you don &apos;t have to do it .
It &apos;s important for us to live in social terms .
And obviously , you can &apos;t see it . You can &apos;t see it .
And here you &apos;ll see the <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) If there were <unk> , I didn &apos;t know if I was born .
You know , you &apos;ve got it . You know , you know , you know ?
Or if the elephant were elephant .
1983 .
( Laughter ) In 1958 , Cyclone Nargis devastated .
He took five dollars to see that he would take five dollars on his chest , until he died , so much as long as I was traveling .
Here &apos;s the <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
They &apos;re really excited about this work , because you don &apos;t see it , because you don &apos;t know , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — people like these pictures of images .
This is in Sao Paulo , in Sao Paulo .
Here I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m not going to sit down here . I can &apos;t see it . I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do . All right , right now . All right , right now .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve got 28 dollars to take care of this <unk> . ( Laughter )
Now , if you don &apos;t know what to do right now ? <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of it .
I &apos;m not going to see this .
There was a human being .
It &apos;s a lot of people I don &apos;t know about cars with cars .
We &apos;re closer to see .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m a great speaker , two , two , two , two , two .
People are respecting thousands of individuals .
They &apos;d go back to the ground , and they &apos;d go back to the floor to deal with the floor .
You are going to be a picture in front of you , and in the context of <unk> , which is a picture .
This is an image of another <unk> view . It &apos;s <unk> .
In any case , a building can be a wonderful thing .
( Laughter ) Now , this is really <unk> , you know ?
There &apos;s another example of that , you know , another example of the possibility of another example of this .
There &apos;s a film called &quot; &quot; The Network , &quot; &quot; which is a film called &quot; &quot; The Network . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re talking about it .
You can &apos;t see the way the way it comes from , and the story of the world is really big .
It turns out to be there .
It &apos;s the answer to the question that &apos;s wrong .
( Laughter ) This is a <unk> , <unk> messages of electronics .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the worst .
This was a great story .
( Laughter ) If there &apos;s no <unk> , I &apos;m sorry .
And I &apos;m going to see the summer of May .
And if we &apos;re going to have two ways in two ways , if we &apos;re going to have two ways to go .
All day .
Now , if you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of the secret message if you don &apos;t know the secret message ?
( Music ) &#91; <unk> &#93; ( Applause )
( Music ) What I &apos;m saying ? <unk> : Devil !
( Laughter ) The Devil ? I don &apos;t have the least flute players .
Now , you know what your brain is in the middle of your brain , and you can &apos;t see what your brain is .
( Music ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) If you can see what it is , you can see what happens when you see it .
It was a little bit of a story that was small , fresh and <unk> .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t know what people are trying to do .
There &apos;s a pop box .
<unk> <unk> : This is called <unk> .
You know , you have a lot of friction .
It was between the best five players in 1970 . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> million <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; Love is a lot of love — you know , a lot of people who don &apos;t want to be in the middle of the closet .
There &apos;s a part of it .
( Music ) It &apos;s about 12 billion light years old . This is a decade . No , I can &apos;t say that this is true . No , I can tell you that it &apos;s right .
Announcer : All right . At least 30 minutes .
This would be like , &quot; &quot; You know , six thousand light-years away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , six thousand light-years away . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; The Great Divide . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; This is the Big Bang . &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t have any opportunity to do .
And in fact , &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; The Guardian is writing , &quot; &quot; you know , we know how much we don &apos;t know what we are .
We don &apos;t have 12 billion light years , and it &apos;s not a <unk> billion light years .
We know how many of you are going to be able to be able to have a small number of them .
So , if not just properly properly properly properly properly , we can get very close to right .
And what I &apos;m saying is that , after the writing of the text , then you can tell him , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve been able to call it up . &quot; &quot; I thought I was very sorry , I didn &apos;t have a lot to do it .
It was a <unk> . He wrote a book .
I &apos;m not going to do it with it .
( Music ) ( Music ends ) Now , the way it works is to take a billion light years from the universe .
It &apos;s going to have to share with your memory , but that &apos;s the closest you can see .
And so , in fact , we &apos;ve been able to take care of each other , so we don &apos;t have to deal with each other .
( Laughter ) Okay ?
( Applause )
In the 1960s , in the 1960s , in the 1960s , in the 1960s , there was <unk> .
It was a <unk> <unk> that was written in a van .
He knew that the government knew all the papers .
This is a piece of paper that we &apos;ve made , which is a paper called <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And so we &apos;ve been able to tell you that this is a carpet that &apos;s kind of a carpet , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
We don &apos;t even try to get rid of it .
But in fact , in 1958 , in 1990 , one of which was a great brand new brand — ( Applause ) — you know , you &apos;ve got to take a piece of something that &apos;s going on in a laser , and you can see that the yellow dot at all the time , and the yellow dot , the yellow dot , the yellow dot .
This is <unk> .
Nobody knows that .
This is a <unk> technology that we can do with our technology .
This problem of three main online online projects .
And if we can look at the trends that we can &apos;t see , then we can see the online landscape online , and we see that in fact .
This is from three basic basic principles .
First , online .
This is what I call the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s not really hard to understand what &apos;s going on in the next week .
These guys don &apos;t get paid .
And so many people who are very , very , very , very , very , very good for men .
Actually , I &apos;m going to write a blog on my online blog , <unk> people who are <unk> .
This is what I call <unk> <unk> .
This is Alfred .
This is a robot .
This is <unk> .
This is Matthew Anderson , and I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re born .
And these guys are online online , but we can do it in ways that we can do this , but we can use these things to be able to make the work that I &apos;m trying to do , while I &apos;m trying to make these things work , or if we &apos;re trying to make these things work , or if we don &apos;t have to make the work online , I can &apos;t see if I &apos;m going to be able to take care of the cards .
Two months ago , in the U.S. , two months ago , in the U.S. , Sam <unk> , who said , &quot; &quot; Sam <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was the <unk> of the United States , the <unk> <unk> million U.S. Americans .
There are no words of Sam <unk> .
I think it &apos;s more than the real world that &apos;s going on online , and this day is more than the real world .
And it turns out that you can &apos;t even see if you &apos;re in the middle .
It &apos;s going to be a great job online online .
The second big challenge that we &apos;ve got to do is not make money to do this .
They &apos;re going to tell us that this works when we &apos;re going to see these work , the idea that we can do .
And in the last year , I &apos;ve been trained as Anonymous , and I &apos;m going to show the foundation for the next year .
I &apos;ve counted two main numbers of three main principles : that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do , and the third main challenge , which is the third basic force , and the third idea is the state , and the third main force .
Let &apos;s see if we don &apos;t like it .
This is what I &apos;m really sure about when I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> .
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk> — more or less .
Over the past year , in the next year , the online press came out .
If you give someone a whole system , you don &apos;t know all the system .
And last week , I asked the government to tell me about this , and I asked the government to tell me that if I had to tell you that I didn &apos;t know why I was born , I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you tell me that when I was a person .
He said .
What if there are people in the heart , people die ?
I &apos;m going to run online online .
It &apos;s the number of lines that we have .
What do we do ?
Now , if you have a sense of happiness , and if you have a tendency to do it , you need to be able to tell you that if you don &apos;t like it , and if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t want to do it .
We &apos;re able to use it to be able to take care of whether or not , but as if we don &apos;t like Iran , we &apos;re more likely to be able to live in countries like Iran , where we don &apos;t know much more than any other countries , because we don &apos;t want to be able to get rid of the United States , because if you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t want to use the local government to deliver the local government .
But that means that you can &apos;t actually use it to be able to be able to put it in the middle of the city .
It &apos;s possible to get rid of the stratosphere .
That was the end of the day .
So , how do you deal with Arabic and form ?
And in the &apos; 60s , 2011 , 2011 , in 2011 , 2011 , I was able to tell you a lot about how many of you were going to be able to live in a secret configuration .
And between those of us , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And in this case , I had to take care of all the connections that I could use , which would allow me to be able to use all of the networks in order to sustain all of the networks under control .
This can &apos;t be able to get rid of the needle that we don &apos;t expect .
It &apos;s just right here .
Now , in the Western world , the Western <unk> <unk> , the Western <unk> <unk> .
But the Western civilization does this .
For example , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , I didn &apos;t call &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; three weeks ago .
You know , I &apos;m going to tell you that if you don &apos;t know , your car is <unk> .
Now , here we are now .
The Internet will follow .
If you don &apos;t know , if you don &apos;t know , you know , if you don &apos;t know all the details , you know , you don &apos;t want to play online , you know , listen to your online choice .
Now , a lot of people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is a big idea , not a good job , no good job , no good job , no good job , but I don &apos;t have a lot to do it .
I &apos;m worried about why ?
I don &apos;t have the hidden thing . &quot; &quot; But this is a great idea .
( Laughter ) <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
It &apos;s not mutually exclusive . It &apos;s not mutually exclusive .
This depends on the scale between and control .
And the year I believe that this is a story that we &apos;ve been able to tell you about the year , and this is what we &apos;re doing .
But if you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to be able to live 50 years in the middle , you &apos;re not going to face the eye on the eye .
And so the question is , and the question is , in 50 years , we &apos;ve got to worry about us .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you , thank you , &quot; &quot; because I was 17 years old .
And this was the first semester in Washington DC , and this was the first year in Washington DC .
My friends and friends and friends have told me that I am there .
I said , &quot; &quot; You know what you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; my mother said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
( Laughter ) Now imagine the behavior of 17 years old , and you think about the behavior of the <unk> .
And my father said to me , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t tell you , because I didn &apos;t know what they came from .
And in 17 years old , I said , &quot; Oh my God , what I &apos;m saying is , &quot; Who is my God ? &quot;
And then I started to deal with that , and I started to deal with that .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; I want to take care of it . &quot;
And yet , this is what we &apos;re doing .
I &apos;d like to tell you about it , and I want to tell you about what I &apos;m talking about , and I want to tell you about my own story .
In the past year , I &apos;ve been reminded of the fact that if I had two oil in the Golden Gate Bridge under the Golden Gate Bridge , at that time , when I was in the Golden Gate Bridge , when I was in the Golden Gate Bridge .
And so I decided that I didn &apos;t know how much I could do it , and I decided that I couldn &apos;t do it .
This is a huge thing for California .
And this also is something that I &apos;ve experienced in <unk> , which is something that I live in , which is a big thing , and it &apos;s not a big thing , and it &apos;s about 350 men sitting there on top of it .
And I started out here , and I went on here , and people — no matter what was going on .
And they said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to do this for the environment , right ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; You know , if you don &apos;t know , people don &apos;t believe me . &quot;
Because , as I said , I didn &apos;t know when I was talking about it .
And I was fascinated by the people who were connected to this .
I did this .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I can use it to make more <unk> . &quot; &quot; And my father said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you get this in the age of 16-year-old ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about the environment .
They &apos;re in Philadelphia in Philadelphia .
I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , I don &apos;t need to tell you that if you don &apos;t need it . &quot;
So , I decided to make the birth of my <unk> <unk> , which is — I decided to make a lot better — I decided to tell you that I &apos;d like to talk to you about a daily day , a daily daily , a daily daily , a daily day .
So I did this .
And in the morning , I was in the middle of the morning .
And I &apos;m saying , this is a wonderful experience for me , because I &apos;ve always started to get my first time in this journey .
And I was thinking about myself and my father .
Because I was always thinking about what I thought I would like to tell you about what I would like to tell you about what I would like to tell you about what I want to talk about .
And when people talk to them , they don &apos;t talk to them , and they talk about what they talk about .
and then ...
So , we &apos;ve got to communicate .
And that day , I was really worried about that day .
And that was my foundation for me , because I realized I didn &apos;t know .
I was 27 years old , and I knew everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So I did this for the next day , and then I went back to that time , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a year . &quot; &quot; I said , I had a year ago , and I needed a year ago , and I needed it .
So , a year ago , I was thinking about a year ago , and then I thought , maybe I &apos;m going to talk about a year ago .
But it &apos;s not about 17 years old .
I &apos;ve been obsessed with this 17 years , and I &apos;ve been trying to pretend that I &apos;m not going to grow up in this 17 years , and I &apos;ve been able to tell you , and I &apos;ve been able to learn a book , and I &apos;ve been able to learn from the book and try to learn a book .
And I thought , well , I need education .
We had to go back to Oregon , Oregon , where they were in the environment .
800 km ² .
And what do you know ? And what ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Oh , you know what you &apos;re saying here ?
<unk> ?
You &apos;ve got a special role for you .
And two years later , I finished the ratio of <unk> .
And my father came back . He was my father .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , my son is my son , but we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do . &quot;
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — I started thinking , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to take care of it , and I started to start thinking about it .
<unk> , Washington , I came to Washington to Washington , D.C. , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from Idaho to Washington , in Montana .
Two years ago , when I was in Libby , Montana , I was in the middle of the Montana .
Two years ago , there was not bad .
( Laughter ) And it happened . I took two years of education , and I got trained to me .
There are two stories in Montana .
The first is that , in fact , there is this thing that I can &apos;t see .
And they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know what &apos;s going on in the morning . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care about a school for a lecture .
You &apos;re going to see the South South Coast , <unk> ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said to her , &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> , South America .
So I did this .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Okay , John , John , for a lesson that I could do with my father &apos;s office . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , John , for a lesson , I can do it .
And when I first asked you to tell you that all of my daughters will be able to take care of them .
Whether it &apos;s easy , and if you don &apos;t want to be able to solve it , then you can go back and see if you don &apos;t want to solve it . &quot; &quot; Great ! You don &apos;t know . You don &apos;t know . You don &apos;t know .
I was big enough to help me to help me .
And I didn &apos;t think that the environment was very much in the environment , and in this way , I &apos;d like to talk to me about it .
And in that period of time , I didn &apos;t know if we were married .
For the first time in class , there were 13 mirrors in the classroom .
And my friend of mine gave them my voice : John , John Dave , who said to me , &quot; &quot; The name is Dave Francis , &quot; &quot; which is not the last one .
These are all of us .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to see my thesis in my career .
But that was what I did .
After two months , he was working with our daughters .
And so I learned very much about this lesson — this kind of thing I learned from that .
And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , John &apos;s working . &quot; &quot; — I don &apos;t know what I think — I don &apos;t know , I think , I don &apos;t know .
No , no , no . That &apos;s not that .
Have you ever done it .
You can do it .
No , he &apos;s not going to talk to her .
So , this explains this debate , and we &apos;ve been discussing this debate .
I &apos;m going to go back to this <unk> , and say , I &apos;m sorry .
But what we &apos;ve learned is something that we &apos;ve learned but sometimes , when I &apos;m a kid , who is really good at all , but I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking about .
And I thought , well , if you don &apos;t know , and if you don &apos;t know , well , you don &apos;t know good enough .
So I went .
And my father said to my father , &quot; &quot; My father , &quot; &quot; and my father said , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re not going to go to the <unk> , but you know , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;ll tell you .
What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; And I went back to the University of Wisconsin .
And two years ago , there were two years talking about <unk> <unk> .
Nobody knows that oil is going to take place .
But something did something happened — Exxon Valdez .
And I was the only guy who was talking about the oil oil , and I was in the U.S.
And my father knew that .
He said , &quot; &quot; Son , I don &apos;t know how to do this with my son , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not using it .
He said , &quot; &quot; I need to tell you that you need to tell you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing . You do better . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
And when I came back , I had to tell you about seven years old in the Atlantic Ocean , and I had to spend seven years and seven years left in the Atlantic .
I began to focus on <unk> <unk> , and I began to focus on my knees .
And in fact , if you don &apos;t know that , you know , if you don &apos;t know that , you know , if you don &apos;t know that , if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s not the sound of a man .
And I thank you , and I thank you , and I thank you .
And that &apos;s what I mean .
And they said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not talking about myself . &quot;
And this is something that we have — and this is something that we have .
And indeed , really big — we need to be able to get rid of our plans .
And I went on .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I don &apos;t know yet .
I was able to spend my life on the canopy , and I spent a lot of time on the street .
In the United States — in the United States — in the U.S.
20 years ago , if someone told me , &quot; John , if you want to make a <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I want to go . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you go to the right step , your eyes and your dreams . &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m going to go on . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m going to go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Man , you want to go . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; Yes .
How would that happen ? How do you know ?
Have you ever been able to tell you about how you &apos;re going to be able to grow up and do simple ?
The coral reefs of the coral reef .
And then — and then — here &apos;s a year ago — I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , this is a year ago , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , this is a year for <unk> , &quot; &quot; and all the islands were <unk> , and all the islands were <unk> , and all of the islands were <unk> .
The key question is , I want to tell you why I want to tell you why .
And I started to tell the story , I started to say that I couldn &apos;t see the environment .
And this is the environment that we have in the environment , but it &apos;s also the fact that we don &apos;t know the environment .
And when I was talking about — people were talking about — people who were worried about it , and we did not .
And I don &apos;t just want to tell each other , but not just because we don &apos;t have access to each other , but not just because we don &apos;t want to tell each other , but we don &apos;t have to tell each other .
And if we don &apos;t change the environment , and if we don &apos;t understand the environment , we can tell each other , and if we don &apos;t understand the environment .
And that was what I wanted to do .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to go on this poster . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry — this is my own story , and I got back on it — and I got back on it , and I started out on it .
This is the story of the story , and I realized that I didn &apos;t have to go there .
I had to go back to El Sistema in El Sistema — and I was in the middle prison , and I didn &apos;t know what happened to me because I didn &apos;t know anything because I didn &apos;t know anything .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; and <unk> <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
I didn &apos;t have to tell you that I didn &apos;t have to show you .
I was in the GMT — a doctor , Francis and I left the world .
What if we could do that ?
We came across the road .
I &apos;m sorry .
What am I saying to God , and what am I saying ?
And after 150 miles away from 150 km , I realized that I didn &apos;t know if I was born .
I was in my village , and I was living there .
I was in my hometown of <unk> , where I was in my hands .
What happens ?
Because at the moment I began to show me that I would like to be able to show me .
But it turns out that every single word that I &apos;ve been talking about is , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m going to be able to tell you that the GMT will be <unk> .
Professor <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so I realized that I didn &apos;t know , just just just like I could , but I didn &apos;t even know myself .
You know , we can do that .
I had to change myself .
And I don &apos;t know , because I &apos;m not always going to be able to do it .
Because , you know , I didn &apos;t go to prison .
I didn &apos;t know who I was .
But I knew it was necessary .
I knew , because this was the only way I could show that this day , this was the only way I could .
And I know , when we spend a lot of time in our consciousness that we need to live , but there are other places that we don &apos;t want to know .
And we don &apos;t want to go to where we are , and we &apos;re going to be able to go to where we are and where we are , and we need to be able to go to where we are .
And I want to focus on the next to where I &apos;m going to go to the next place — where you can take care of what you &apos;re seeing in your apartment , where you can take a stick with you on the floor , where you can do it .
We now are now .
In the past of the past , we have to be able to tell us about the past .
And if I &apos;m going to tell you , if I &apos;m going to tell you , if I &apos;m going to tell you that if I &apos;m here , if I &apos;m here , I &apos;m going to tell you that if I &apos;m here .
Now , I know when I became here , you can do it with me .
I &apos;m going to tell you — this is the story that we &apos;re going to talk to the world , and this is how we &apos;re going to talk to the world that we &apos;re going to talk to each other in the world .
Because what we &apos;re seeing is the environment that we can relate to the environment , and our form of perception that we can relate to .
So I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re here , and here I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m five years old .
Thank you .

So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re in America , you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know what ? &quot;
And what you &apos;re saying is , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is a <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , what &apos;s called ? &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; Do you know what ? &quot;
They have names , they are the blocks of the blocks , the blocks of the Internet , and you &apos;re going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s a little bit of fun .
Now , imagine if you &apos;re going to be able to tell the story that you &apos;re going to be able to tell the story that you &apos;re going to be able to tell the guy who &apos;s going to be the right man , &quot; &quot; <unk> , that &apos;s what &apos;s called ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; You know , this is a block , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , why ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have names names . &quot;
They have names .
You can see the Google Map . They &apos;re 14 , 15 , 16 , 12 , 18 , 18 , 12 .
They have all these <unk> names , which are between the blocks .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you measure your home ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , how do you measure your home ? &quot;
And this is a block of 17 and a <unk> one , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Okay . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to go back home and say , &quot; &quot; Sure . &quot; &quot; They say , &quot; &quot; Sure .
My first home was the first home of the home .
After that , after that , I couldn &apos;t tell you that I was born .
This is <unk> . You can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Sometimes I love it . &quot; &quot; And then one of the people in the world will be able to see that if we don &apos;t know anything that we can do .
For example , if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;re not going to be able to do it with you .
And when you know what you &apos;re trying to do in the months and months , and if you don &apos;t have any money , and if you don &apos;t have any money , because they don &apos;t have a chance to do it with you , because they &apos;re rich when they &apos;re trustworthy .
( Applause ) Thank you very much . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) One , two , three four four four .
But the African is an African &quot; &quot; piece of music , &quot; &quot; which is a piece of music that &apos;s going on in the end .
So , you know , it &apos;s not just that you don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just two , three , four , four .
And this map is true .
I mean , you know , you know , you know what &apos;s going on in India , and it &apos;s true of it .
So , you know , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve got a lot or a lot in other places , and if you have a great job , or if you have a good job , you can see that it &apos;s true .
<unk> <unk> .
