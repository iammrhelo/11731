It &apos;s going to be a year of this year that we &apos;re going to have a billion people who are involved with each other .
The people who are talking about it is that they have to die .
Now , it &apos;s a bit of a trick , but I think it &apos;s my true story , but I think it &apos;s my true story .
The first time I was thinking about it after the first time , I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to talk about this after the age of Dan .
My family gave her a friend of hers and friend of hers to write the post that he was published after him .
This is what he wrote at first .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is . I die , and it &apos;s my last job .
I was very positive , as my whole body would end up with my family and my family , and I would share a message that I wrote as I was writing as the first part of my blogs as I was in the wild , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a magazine artist . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s the way that a magazine artist was able to be write better , and more importantly , that &apos;s the way that the whole of the world works in the world .
Carking roofs .
Now 48 hours of footage uploaded to YouTube every minute .
It &apos;s about 200 million people .
It &apos;s about 90 percent per Facebook company creates 90 percent per month .
When you think about your parents , whether you &apos;re grandparents , they &apos;ve created a bunch of pictures of mosses , or the charismatic , or the two meals that live in the hijab .
But today , we &apos;re creating the incredibly rich , digital tools that will be able to live in the course of the day after our deaths .
I think this is creating an incredibly adaptable or more powerful thing for publishers .
Well , for clarity , I &apos;m a firm , and I don &apos;t have a reference , so I &apos;d like to pretend to be able to make a look at what the universe is like .
We are already seeing some of the characteristics that allow us to express ourselves , that we can learn that we can learn from our own anti-industrial knowledge and our own deaths .
And one day , one of them , I think , is that I &apos;m an expert in the New York City Board of Education .
( Recording ) Adam : Thou shalt not .
die : Adam ?
Nope .
Death : Death can eat you in any place , even in Arkansas .
A : Does that happen ?
Morow : Paaval.let .
( Laughter ) A : sleep , isn &apos;t sleep ?
And this is the service that makes certain things : allowing us to create a message or video that can be published on Facebook , after you die .
The other heart has a 1,000 .
It allows you online to pay attention to the street and send it to the beverage of mosses , and the images that they can post to post to print out .
But it &apos;s only interesting .
Many of you might have heard of you a little bit about Dan Roe , who was playing with the video , like hello to a 90,000 watch .
And I think with a lot of power that &apos;s going to take care of human mobility , and we &apos;re going to build a lot of data about the data , whether it &apos;s going to work , and it &apos;s going to work , and it &apos;s going to work , and it turns out that we &apos;re making a lot of fuss about it .
And I think once it is , it &apos;s going to be a little bit for our digital system that we can continue to live our lives in the past and after our deaths , because of the way that we &apos;ve created , and the ability of technology to deliver that .
Now we look at a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s a service that &apos;s like a heart , and it &apos;s a lot of people who are all around the lights , everything that you &apos;ve done , and it makes a good bet that you can write the next thing .
So as you can see , you can see that it can be exhausting .
And imagine how something like this is going to look at five , 10 or 20 years from improving tech .
And so in front of it , there &apos;s a lot of work in front of this , and the medical work has been working on the distribution of people who can identify people .
And if you &apos;re able to do a lot of people who have been able to learn how to look at the other people , you know , you know , in hundreds of thousands , hundreds of thousands of people in the world are created .
You know , I &apos;m going to leave you with a friend of mine in the United States of 2008 , where I was in the United States , when CNN had transacted a joint of hip hop .
And what if we could use this technology to do that , what if we could use this technology to do the same way that they had created , what was they created as a very , very common way that they lived ?
Well , I think it &apos;s nearly possible to say that we &apos;re going to have a data set of data and technology that allows them to have a lot of social capacity for their analogy .
Well , I think that &apos;s the way we think we should think about it , or we want it to become a reality for life , and when that &apos;s what it means to be life and what &apos;s going on .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You &apos;ve heard , you &apos;ve heard , you &apos;ve heard , you &apos;ve heard of it .
The first one is from Jean-CFCs , from Jean-CFCs .
The other one comes from the head .
We really understand more about the fabric of the cosmos .
Sadly , the answer is yes .
There is a challenge that is empowering .
Well , you &apos;ve heard a piece of reality that you want to understand .
And then we can do that , and we can do it .
I mean , we have to look at the fundamental behaviors that we have in our face , we have to have to look at the fundamental behaviors of the universe .
And these are the things that we put in a cup of a cup of fish , a swimmer of fish .
Now , what &apos;s wrong is that these systems are lung cancer in mathematics .
What about complex systems ?
As a turns , it turns out to be more complex and more complex and more likely to turn around the world .
And we &apos;re trying to understand the system of this and do it .
This is the system .
It doesn &apos;t work , but it doesn &apos;t work with your cup .
And in the study of complex systems — complex nets .
But why not have the canonans ?
Where are the engines ?
We were in the factory net .
TBP : A percent of my students have contributed .
What you &apos;ve seen is that what makes grit in your mind is that it determines what makes interests mean .
You might have to think that nobody would ever look at it .
&quot; What are they doing ? &quot;
Or karate , TNK .
These are companies that work in more than countries , and there are 42,000 .
There was a mountain of 600 and a half , and there was a net , which was 600 , and there was a net , 600 .
who has about 75 percent of the people who are trained .
And at the center of the pyramid , there was a financial structure .
But they give you about 95 percent of the profits from the fundamental action .
But the answer to the question , why is it about who ?
You want to push other things as you do .
The plant is an analogy .
And so with a cannibated grid , it &apos;s a whole network .
And these are 1337 acres of anti-37 acres and cultures .
And if you &apos;ve done a little bit of prosthetic stuff .
It &apos;s exceedingly likely for all of us to know .
Now , I want to talk about what I want to talk about , and what I want to talk about is what we &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s really the end of the world when we think about it .
I don &apos;t know the end of you , but if I represent this metaphysical , I would like to sort of see a painting from the animation — as if a person , it &apos;s like a person , it &apos;s like a person who comes back to the next , and it turns out that he &apos;s going to go to a channel .
And I think it &apos;s this way , because if you &apos;re not trying to figure it out .
Palm is not a lot of fun .
It &apos;s something that happens with us without our permission .
I &apos;m a writer and the teacher &apos;s teacher , what means I &apos;m talking about elephants , I &apos;m going to do my life .
And you can say , and I &apos;d like to point out , and I &apos;d like to give you a sense that a lot of people that we live in order to talk about things — to be even more frequent , to have a problem .
So we don &apos;t .
We are beaten .
We &apos;ll stop .
We fall in .
We are a clean garage .
It makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
The rest of the heart falls .
So , our metaphysical transformation , our metaphysical effort , is going to give you a sense of domestic violence .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s true .
And they &apos;re going to take us out as a beehive and a non-long time .
My favorite thing is , &quot; &quot; Nameen , &quot; &quot; which is the theme of the minaret of the word &quot; &quot; sale . &quot; &quot; And if you look at that word — ( Laughter ) — you &apos;ll see that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that I am a quote from a very different message , in the Old West .
It &apos;s like one of the United States , in fact , has 16 so-called &quot; &quot; freedom , &quot; &quot; which is in the U.K. , and it turns out that in the U.K. , there &apos;s a lot of people in the world , and it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of people in the room and it &apos;s like that .
( Laughter ) We live in words to talk about the shale , which is what we think we want to think about . ( Laughter )
Right ?
Now , how did that happen ?
How did we get to the idea of what &apos;s going on with a big deal ?
And why are we talking about this kind of big experience , as if we &apos;re like ?
These are the harder questions , but I have a little bit of a test .
And so in order to turn that , I want to focus on one of the creative changes that I &apos;m talking about as a brand .
And when I first started to learn how to learn from a race , I narrowed these metals about crazy stuff .
And in the history of Western culture , the same way that we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to make a lot of things .
Here &apos;s a couple of examples .
William Schrakar : &quot; It &apos;s just a whole thing in Latin , &quot; &quot; because it &apos;s always a kind of crazy thing .
&quot; Look at me , look at me , I &apos;m going to see a lot like this , &quot; with a big big deal of the Fountain of BRILS . ( Laughter )
The first time I was at the first time , I was going to go back to 20 years , and it wasn &apos;t easy .
These were relationships for the first few years , so I knew it was very high , so I knew very early grades .
I &apos;m going to remember one moment .
I was sitting on a bed in the New York State of America , and I watched my way back to the door .
It was called , almost south , and we went back to our dad , and we went back to our dad , and we went back and forth .
I don &apos;t have to remember this argument before , but I &apos;m very excited about this , I &apos;m going to forget it .
I was 22 years old , and it was my first sailboat in the country , that it was just a little bit .
I went back to my left home , and I knew the name of my hometown , and I knew it was a city , and I &apos;d have to go out , and I didn &apos;t think I would have to go out , but I didn &apos;t think I would have to do it .
I had no money and very little money , and I didn &apos;t know the way .
Some other people have been able to associate it as a moment of opportunity , but I was freezing .
I just stayed there .
And then I cried .
But despite my panic , my first voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Wow . It was a drama .
I truly am the whole thing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m not a Catholic for me to feel embarrassed by myself .
Now , that &apos;s so bizarre for me , but at 22 years old , I was going to have a <unk> tic experience , and at that moment , I was a little counterintuitive , and I thought it was really good , but I thought it was like a man &apos;s mouth , it &apos;s just a guy who left me .
I think , in fact , I &apos;d like to be a little bit more likely to be able to be able to be a little bit more like a little bit , because I thought that this is not that way .
It really wasn &apos;t necessary to be surprised by the fact that there were eight songs in Varola , 14 songs , two bums with the name of &quot; &quot; Vote . &quot; &quot; Once we go back to our panic .
We died .
It &apos;s a real man . &quot; &quot; And I expected that my mother &apos;s first kind of way to do a crazy thing .
But you can hide someone in this way , like , like my daughter &apos;s daughter , and it wasn &apos;t really good for me either .
But I think it &apos;s not very unusual .
Most of us seem to feel a little bit more like a little bit of something that &apos;s a little bit old in the morning .
Well , in fact , there &apos;s a date , which is the date , which is a very good thing , because there &apos;s a lot of scientific evidence suggesting that this is a very good thing , because there is no way that the past of the past is not easy .
It &apos;s true .
This year , I use the analogy of 1999 to the rats , to remind us that there are going to be a breeding society in terms of the way that they observe individuals from the spectrum of the universe .
( Laughter ) So , what &apos;s going on is a breeding behavior , and the depression .
So , there are a couple of things that have been proven to us that this is not about the transformation of the universe .
And other teachers come back , that most of the relationships are starting to start this way .
And then the following comes from saying , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a breeding mindset that &apos;s going on in terms of talking about what &apos;s going on , &quot; &quot; which reminded me that it &apos;s a little bit like if someone had a face in the face of the face .
And for most of us , it feels like the first time in the world .
It &apos;s typically from a few months to not just a few years old .
When I came back with my journey in the South America , I spent a lot of time in my room , and I spent a lot of time in my room , and I spent a lot of time in my room .
And I decided that if my mom could not understand my mother &apos;s uterus , I didn &apos;t need a friend of mine .
And so I &apos;m going to stop the majority of them .
And that was probably the most popular year in my life .
But I think I felt that to be modern , it was my job , because if I was a modern moment , then I would be able to show you how I got it .
And when I finish it , then we would have the end of the journey .
It &apos;s a real thing , because it doesn &apos;t have a universal rule , because it doesn &apos;t have a universal rule , but it &apos;s a lot of fun , but it &apos;s not as if it &apos;s true .
It is our <unk> tic and nature .
Now , what we &apos;re saying is that this is a good thing to think about this , which is a good thing to use a circle of knowledge in our mother , and then we believe that this is a very good thing , and then we don &apos;t think about it , and then we don &apos;t have an antibiotic , and then we don &apos;t know what it is .
Now , I think you &apos;ve probably heard about this — you &apos;ve heard about this , you know , you know , you &apos;ve heard about some of the world &apos;s ideas that I &apos;m going to do with you , you &apos;re going to have a lot of fun .
( Laughter ) And our culture is producing bridges , and we need to collect that ideas about carrots .
In this case , we &apos;re talking about a little bit about metadata , and there &apos;s tension .
It &apos;s a little bit interesting you &apos;re a little bit more interested .
It &apos;s not glamorous and sometimes , and we call it this way in our words and our history , but our origins and our stories , but our words and our stories and our history .
It &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the culture , which is what &apos;s going on in the culture .
It &apos;s as if we want to heat the way back and crazy , and we want to live in life .
It &apos;s going to look bad .
( Laughter ) To that , we need to change our culture , or change our cup .
And imagine that we were all less likely to lose ourselves .
If we were to be more confident , more and more open , more and more open to the next , we would be able to get it .
I know that it takes a lot of things , but I &apos;m not the first person that I &apos;m seeing .
In the book , &quot; &quot; Metasture , &quot; &quot; which we live in &quot; &quot; The British &quot; &quot; and George Lakar , and he said , &quot; &quot; What is it going to accommodate our metastasis .
They &apos;re going to send them , and they can even pretend to be the leaders of our future issues , like the other ones you &apos;re doing .
Jonny and Liez , I want to tell you a new kind of metaphysical rig for a helmet : How do you have a joint of art .
I really appreciate that way .
Now , &quot; &quot; Luck , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a lot of stuff that &apos;s going on , and there &apos;s a way that you can think of it as a whole , but it &apos;s the way that you think about it , and it &apos;s the way that you think about it .
Now , Jonny and Luck said , well , you know , the leaders of your life in your life are going to melt away , like , &quot; &quot; Oh , a rock , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good , &quot; &quot; with you .
And so , these ideas are very good at giving a whole cultural challenge to a long time , but they also work in other sorts of relationships , because they also work in other sorts of relationships — the short-term , freedom , counterintuitive , insanity , because these are the metals to make a lot more complex ideas in the wild .
So , when it is , it &apos;s a dream of art , then it &apos;s a little bit like this , it &apos;s a stale .
It &apos;s not surprising , because it &apos;s not realistic , it doesn &apos;t require a lot of protection , but it doesn &apos;t require a lot of work , but it doesn &apos;t make sense of it .
And it &apos;s more complicated with identity and a trick .
At the end of the fence , every dog will hide .
When I was young , I didn &apos;t think it seemed like they were not thinking that they were not asking .
When he was a young poet Juilt for the first time , or when he had a cup of Juilt , she was unable to be unable to be unable to meet the next day , because she was not breeding .
Right ?
It &apos;s a hospice .
Right ?
And as a result , we have a little bit of a little bit at the end of the day , with a third or a third , or not die .
He &apos;s alive , and he &apos;s just thrown out .
And I understand that Veronica &apos;s sixteenth is not as much as the most important part of the world in the world , but when I first read it , I was in 14 years old , but when I first read it , I was also reading this .
I &apos;m going to define you as something that I &apos;m going to do with my work , not what I &apos;m going with , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s an easy thing to do with my cane or a tomxbook , which is something that &apos;s going on .
But it &apos;s still hard .
Now , not only in the blink of a day , sometimes it &apos;s absolutely counterintuitive , and when I feel embarrassed , I have to remind myself of myself , to my partners , what I want to do .
This is also easy .
But it &apos;s a lot better than a friend of mine , who is fighting a brand .
This is the way I &apos;m not talking about some of the reasons I fail .
Instead , we need to take a partner with a partner , and how to give you a sense of what it is very simple , but , in fact , it &apos;s a currency that &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s actually , in fact , a currency in which you can &apos;t .
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself , whether you want to be able to think about it , and you &apos;ve started to think that you &apos;re going to be able to work .
And so , like this , I encourage you to say things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t really want to go , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not really good at it . It &apos;s not for us . &quot; &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; These relationships were a carbed , I wore it , but it was wonderful . &quot; &quot; The art maker is a good thing .
So that way , I invite you to step up , how it sounds .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Now , not in &apos; 90s , I still have a classroom with a friend who has a friend of Palm Island on the car , and the city &apos;s headquarters for the city of Road Island , the city &apos;s pants .
Well , you know how it works , when you &apos;re young and Pakistan , we didn &apos;t drive , and we didn &apos;t drive , but we didn &apos;t drive , so much more than a long time .
And I went back to a friend of mine , 3,000 miles away , and I went back to my friends and I started thinking about what I was doing .
&quot; What this is the case for the world ? &quot;
It was on her forehead .
It &apos;s going to wake up to the first place that you can &apos;t get to the first place .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a lot of people saying , &quot; &quot; I mean , there &apos;s a few other things going on there , and then it &apos;s going to get me a little bit later , and then it turns out that it &apos;s a bit like a matter of fact , and then it turns out that it &apos;s a bit like a matter of fact , and then it turns out that it &apos;s a bit like
I think it &apos;s me .
( Laughter ) This is the kind of idea that you &apos;re wearing in the room for writing . ( Laughter )
In the last five years , I &apos;ve been talking about this , and I &apos;ve been talking about this as a while , and how we &apos;re going to understand how we &apos;re going to understand the same things that we &apos;ve been talking about .
First of all , I conducted the last five years in a different gengenicity .
And my way I &apos;m going to leave you with a lot of hard work is , you know , the whole thing is , the whole thing is , it &apos;s a whole thing , it &apos;s a whole thing .
( Laughter ) Now , most of us would have a lot of us from direct care to the idea of our own disability , or whether they &apos;re not willing to try to think about empowerment .
It &apos;s hard to understand that .
We understand that the clock in the room is wrong .
We are people , we have to make mistakes .
But if you do , at this point , I &apos;ve got some of these , and I &apos;ve got to say that , at this point , I have all of these abstract weather about human beings , and I can &apos;t imagine that I &apos;m wrong .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this data cup .
We have to go back to the stress response , and then we have to share our voice and help them .
It &apos;s an extraordinary thing that we &apos;re all doing in doing not believe that we &apos;re going to have to do it .
It &apos;s a problem .
And in my view , it &apos;s a problem as well as every single one of us , in my personal mind , as well as human beings together .
What I want to do today is first a little bit , because we &apos;re really excited about this , because we &apos;re going to be thinking about it .
Secondly , this is why the approach is why the approach is so compelling .
And ultimately , I want to encourage you , I think , if you &apos;re going to be able to do this , it &apos;s the best way to step back , and if you do that , it &apos;s the best of people who have jumped over the back of the year , saying that you can do it .
So why are we going to give you a message ?
The bottom line is linked to listening .
Please say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you , because you are there . &quot; &quot; What if you &apos;re not there , there &apos;s a lot of emotions when you &apos;re wrong ?
Nonsense . Oil .
RAM : All right , files , stick .
So , with an inhospitable experience , with a sense of diversity , you know , all of them — you know , they are the files , but they also give you a different question .
You answer to the question , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sense of sense of God &apos;s mind that you &apos;re not good . &quot; &quot; And then you answer to the question , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sense of sense of God &apos;s mind that you &apos;re not good . &quot; &quot; And then you answer to the question , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sense of sense of God , &quot; &quot; and you answer to the question , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a sense of sense of God , &quot; &quot; you say , &quot;
( Laughter ) So she &apos;s not going to give her a mistake , and she &apos;s going to feel like she was in , and there was a whole range of spectrum , not ?
For example , might be a terrible sense of experience , whether it &apos;s a deepest sense of self , or even the sense of experience , as I am in my <unk> xy .
But the state itself doesn &apos;t have any impact on it .
There &apos;s an analogy .
Do you recall a cartoon of a company called Louis Tong , where the world would be like a long time , but not just like the only way that you don &apos;t have the only way to eat ?
It turns out that every one of the rest of the world &apos;s mind is that it &apos;s going to take a break , and it &apos;s the end of the end of the cliff , which is no problem , because the teddy bear is a crack .
But every time , every single time , the bottom line of the rock are right now .
What &apos;s funny about it , especially when you &apos;re just six years old , is what you &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s going to continue to run out , until you get to see it , and it doesn &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
This is the first time .
When we look at somebody wrong , not if we understand what it is wrong , and we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , we don &apos;t know what wrong , but we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; we &apos;re like a rock .
You know , you &apos;ve been wrong , we &apos;ve done that , we &apos;ve done that , but we still feel confident about land .
I need to push what I &apos;ve said .
There was a sense of despair , which is a sense of purpose .
( Laughter ) Now , beyond this structural form , we &apos;re in the face of our brain .
I &apos;m going to make a mistake .
With more money , we don &apos;t have any sense of ourselves that if we don &apos;t have a delay .
There &apos;s another one another one else , why we celebrate it , it &apos;s more like a culture of culture .
You can finish your job .
You owe it to yourself , but the teacher &apos;s teacher looks like this .
This is not my mind .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in the middle school , and you have to say , think about it .
He &apos;s <unk> ins and shades , he never does .
So , as long as you &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ve seen that , in fact , you &apos;ve seen that , in fact , those who are wrong , they are trained , they are trained to be able to succeed in life , and in other ways , to achieve success in life , you never fail to fail .
And we learn to learn from these good things .
Most of us , as I think , particularly in this room , I think it &apos;s a lot of fun , and I think it &apos;s a lot of work , but it &apos;s kind of like , you know , I think it &apos;s a lot of fun .
I don &apos;t , not , the gift of bridging in the field of funding , in the same way that he &apos;s a superintendent , he &apos;s gone .
( Laughter ) As it turns out , you &apos;re all like , you &apos;re all thinking , there &apos;s a lot of physics and marathonbeans .
Make it .
It &apos;s only when we &apos;re going to make it happen , that we may be able to do something wrong .
So what &apos;s going on in this direction is that if we make a mistake , we make a mistake that something is wrong with us .
So we put on our own , because that &apos;s how we feel smart , we are executed , and we &apos;re giving you a sense of ourselves , because that &apos;s how we feel intelligent , whether it &apos;s true , and we hold it , because that &apos;s how we feel intelligent , whether it &apos;s so intelligent , and we insist on our own way .
Well , let me tell you a story .
A few years ago , the United States &apos;s name was the name of the United States .
This is a spy in the United States .
And in this room , I &apos;ve done the right to the students who have come from , one of the best students in the country .
And this woman had come and put up in an atom .
And he was given under a drug , and the surgeon was on her hand , and then he gave it to the other side of the room .
It was a little bit more likely .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I going wrong with this ? &quot; &quot; And I think she &apos;s going to go , &quot; &quot; Why am I going wrong with this ? &quot; &quot; And then she &apos;s on the floor , because the surgeon did not go on it .
And when he spoke about this , he said he &apos;d say a brochure , he said something very interesting .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , don &apos;t tell you that he was working in the right way . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why I think about it is a story , so that it &apos;s a story , and I think it &apos;s a story because we know what you &apos;re looking at at the right level , it can be wrong .
It &apos;s a way that you can hear that this is the way that we all feel the same experience , you know , we &apos;re going to give you a sense of what &apos;s going on in the phone world .
And when we &apos;re in our own individual , we only think about it , and we don &apos;t think about empowerment , we &apos;re going to make it wrong , we &apos;re going to make a stupid way to measure 760 million people in the world , whether it &apos;s neutral or neutral .
It &apos;s a giant problem .
But this is also a huge challenge for society .
Think about it for a minute , which means it &apos;s a sense of yours .
It means that your mind is going to turn reality .
With this voice , you know , the whole problem is that the whole problem of people is wrong .
And it turns out that most of us have to measure people from other ways of raw value .
The first thing that we think is that we think we &apos;re not going to think of other scientists , because we don &apos;t have any data in the data .
There is no access to information that you have , and when you get your home information , you have to get your own email , and then they &apos;ll be on your own dog .
When it doesn &apos;t work , when we get out , what they do is they do the same way that we fail , but we &apos;re going to keep us out with us to the other person , because that &apos;s why they &apos;re not .
( Laughter ) And they all need a bunch of things , and they all need to eat , they can &apos;t eat it .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , it doesn &apos;t work if we understand that people don &apos;t have a lot of facts , but they are pretty smart , and they &apos;re pretty smart , and they &apos;re pretty smart , and they know it &apos;s true , but for our own careers , it &apos;s true , but for our own careers , it &apos;s true .
This is a disaster .
It doesn &apos;t experience the way that we fail to experience the wrong thing , especially when it &apos;s protected , and it &apos;s not going to take us to each other .
What I &apos;m more about is that I think more about it , I think it &apos;s a lot of stuff that &apos;s going to be true to our humanity .
It &apos;s like , you know , we want to believe that our brains are these things — these are these things that we can observe , and that we can look at what &apos;s going on and putting the lights off .
And we want to look at what &apos;s going on , and we &apos;ve seen what they &apos;ve seen before .
It &apos;s not true , but it would be exceedingly scarce .
It &apos;s not about what we can see the world that exist .
It turns out that we can see the light in it .
We can have memories of the world , and we can imagine , and we can imagine , as if we are other people in other places .
And it &apos;s because everybody sees a little bit of a trick , we can look at the images of the sky and see it , and it &apos;s , and that is , it &apos;s .
It &apos;s this way that we fail .
And in fact , 200 years ago , like David sent out the elephant , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a lot of people who have come up with , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m wrong .
And what we &apos;ve discovered is that the fact that the fact that the possibility of failure is not an incomplete idea of the human system , you don &apos;t have something to do with it or not .
This is a human .
Because we &apos;re not God , we don &apos;t know what the world is doing .
In addition to other animals , we &apos;re going to push this world .
And I think it &apos;s the end of the story — this is a coma , and I think it &apos;s a combination of creativity and creativity .
Well , I began to listen to a lot of people , I started to listen to a lot of people , &quot; &quot; This is a long time , &quot; &quot; to a society that &apos;s in my life .
And I was listening , and I started to experience it , and I started to experience it , and I started to experience it .
At first I thought I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I was going .
Now , I &apos;m always going to talk like crazy .
It &apos;s happening everywhere .
But by a few months later , I had the ability to interview the Internet in my head .
I &apos;ve been talking about this , and I &apos;ve said , &quot; This is true . &quot;
And he showed that the stakes are going to even warm up , that he &apos;s in the knee , which is the exact top .
And she said , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s something like this , but it &apos;s really happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is that , &quot; &quot; like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is that we need to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting about it .
We need to have a lot of things that are going on , and you &apos;re not going to have to take these hot spots to feed these hot spots . &quot; &quot; What kind of people do we want to listen to , the audience , listen , as we listen to them , as we know that we &apos;re going to get a little bit of money .
We &apos;re going to push all of this , creative and uninspiring .
What kind of conversation we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;ll sleep wrong .
But you know what your driving zone is like .
We think we &apos;re going to think it &apos;s true .
George W. Bush thought that the attacker , they would find out that the killer app , the people and the people and the idea of the BBC , Bobby Bloom .
It really happened .
Well , the same and Hobism of Mubarak assumed that it was going to be a doctoral fellow in my life until you get older , and then I can challenge your son .
It really happened .
And you have to think of it , and you &apos;ve ever thought , well , you know , you &apos;re going to steal from your school , you don &apos;t care about how many kids together .
It really happened .
I have to admit that I thought I &apos;d write the most famous book about something , which no one is trying to not fit .
It really happened .
( Laughter ) This whole life .
And we &apos;re going to build incredible ideas about the theme of the world , but it &apos;s a better place , but it turns out that the world is not .
You don &apos;t listen , but it &apos;s going to make it wrong .
Now , we &apos;re going to push the whole thing a week to talk to you about ideas , but you know , why do we need all of these things , better and better jobs , but do you know what these conclusions are , and then you know why we need these kinds of insights , and then you know why we need these types of values , are going to improve and design ?
Because half of the courage were really crazy and they were able to change the way that the world would change the world — when you look at TED in &apos; 80s , then it was still there .
( Laughter ) Right ? ( Laughter ) Right ?
Where are my patwocas , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;ll come again .
It will continue to continue .
We &apos;ll find another one .
We tell another story .
We have a little bit of our own organization .
It &apos;s a good place , as you &apos;ve already heard about seven million times turned out to be an amazing idea .
And so if you really want to really want to understand the truth , I &apos;m going to take you out of the way that you think about it , and you &apos;re going to look at each other , and you look at each other , and you look at each other .
I &apos;m wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) All sharing . ( Applause )
Five years of 1990 , the year of 1990 , the South anian Nakar Nakar , and he &apos;s going to go on the back of the United States , and he &apos;s done in the United States .
The first time , I had to admit that I had a lot of attention , but when he was in the course of course , I gave him a message for other crimes , and he had to set up an army of people who began to swim like New York City , including dancing , the general headquarters of the Argu<unk> Argu<unk> Reuse .
Well , fortunately , these plans were very comfortable information .
But unfortunately , in 1991 , in 1990 , in 1990 , we didn &apos;t have to go .
And the result of this is the result of Nagora .
Satisfied Nsar — my father .
I was born in Pinsburg , in 1983 , in 1983 in a family and a pan-American artist , and artist designers , the artist &apos;s staff , the artists that come together as a young boy .
But when I was seven years old , I was going to blend in .
My dad told me that she told me that she was a little bit old to see , and I &apos;m going to have a lot of Muslim people .
It &apos;s my experience that tells you that when people meet each other , they don &apos;t need a lot of time to figure out what &apos;s going on .
But in fact , in every link , there will be a little bit of a message to people who have been working so much that they &apos;ve done their values , that sense of need to use other kinds of things that will enable us to use other kinds of things .
A few months later , the father of my parents came up with me and told me that a few of the last weekend with a friend of mine was sitting at the heart of Long Island , to compete .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave you with it .
We went to a stress response called the CFO for which we used the FBI .
And that day , my last day , my last year , I spent a little bit of trawling in a small village , and , in particular , the whole thing of my voice , and particularly in my life , all of my life has dropped .
And my grandmother came back to a friend and he said to me in Arabic , and he said , &quot; &quot; Yuck . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And my dad .
It &apos;s very profound , but it &apos;s just a few years later , but only within a few years I &apos;ve understood it .
They &apos;ve seen that I &apos;ve seen this as a parent .
And the result of those people who had lived in a van in a van that was filled with a whole bunch of vacant lots of vacant lots of vacant lots , vacant lots and lots and lots and lots of people , and you had a sick person , you had a thousand .
These were men that I did .
And these people , I &apos;ve been called &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; one .
I &apos;ve changed the place of 20 years , and it &apos;s not about my childhood , and it &apos;s not about my childhood , but it &apos;s not about my childhood .
Every time I read it , I started to experience myself in one place , just to press things and push it back to the other city .
And I &apos;m always going to talk to the corner of the class , and I often have to be a little bit of a halve .
And I lied my personalities to students from my peers , to not make the honor , but as it turns out , it turns out to be a kid in the field .
and walk in a computer class .
It &apos;s not surprising that my social skills have been , and it &apos;s not good enough .
I &apos;ve learned to plant people at the exact opposite of the day in terms of scenarios like race .
Well , I &apos;m going to open up here ?
The first person to put it in the face of this mindset , it happened during the year 2000 .
So once a while , I was able to do a lot of people in the same way that I could go to the United States .
My community was in college .
And the community of our community reflects the most mundane chiefs .
And one day , close to the end of the day , I found out that one of my new friends was a little girl .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s a few days away from home , organic power .
I never had a friend in the room , and I was telling you that I was going to have a friend of mine , and I was telling you that I was going to stop in my life .
The other thing that &apos;s going on there was a year later , and there was a year in Bid Gads .
And I saw people in the world of different ages and cultures , and that would have been very fundamental to my meltdown .
It &apos;s not a good thing to do .
As a matter of fact , I &apos;ve been able to see that a lot of them have been the ones that many of them have been the most , most of them .
We<unk> of rats , by the age of childhood , gave me a sense of privacy , and to me , I don &apos;t know how to treat other people &apos;s good people , not as I would like to do it .
It &apos;s a sense that I &apos;ve learned to give you a sense of childhood , where I &apos;ve learned from my childhood experiences with life .
I &apos;m not home , I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m a woman , but I &apos;m not at home , but I &apos;m not at home , but I &apos;m not home , but I &apos;m not home , I &apos;m not at home , but I &apos;m not at home , but I &apos;m not home , but I &apos;m not home , I &apos;m not home , but I &apos;m not home , I &apos;m not home , but I &apos;m not home , but I &apos;m not home , but I &apos;m not home
And then what was called &quot; &quot; Daily Sview . &quot; &quot; Now , by the century , John Settmaster took me to be honest with my personal obsession , and I also helped to understand that race , whether or not there have nothing to do with anything in the universe .
A lot of them had a lot of meaning to me , who I was in the way I needed .
It &apos;s often going to come out of it , and it &apos;s not at all , right now , right now , right now , that the galissa has been around my fresh view , than my parents &apos; 20s .
And one day I was talking about my mother , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a look at my life .
And she looked at me , and she looked at me more than enough money , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m going to hate people . &quot;
At that moment , I understood how much mass energy is required to pay for those details .
Zach Lovesom is not a reality .
I took it when my family had decided to do their relationships with their parents and their new lives .
So I &apos;m going to discover that I &apos;m going to discover my individual and enable myself to empower myself ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m going to do it in a sense that someone &apos;s ever heard of a story and it realizes that there &apos;s a lot of people who have the privilege , I don &apos;t have a lot of fans .
Instead , I use my <unk> pitous <unk> ines against <unk> ism , against <unk> ism .
I &apos;ve been doing it for slaves , and for their families , for fear and fears that have been on their side of mind .
Now , remember the story of the preconceptions , I &apos;m going to speak against these inhospitable actions and personalities .
I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what the violence isn &apos;t about , whether it &apos;s not a matter of privacy or race , and that my son is not fighting to fulfill my parents .
I &apos;m not my dad .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thanks to everybody . ( Applause )
And it can be a way to make a choice of whether you &apos;re going to make it .
It &apos;s not the best of them .
( Laughter ) I can help make a big choice to make it a little bit less attractive .
When I finish it , when I finish it , I finish it , and when I finish it , I finish it , and when I finish it , when I finish it , if I finish it , I &apos;ll finish it off .
And my mother had a hard time where my mother had broken up in my high school , and she said , &quot; &quot; Where &apos;s the time I &apos;ve been there ? &quot; &quot; where my mind is , &quot; &quot; Where is the beginning of my high school , &quot; &quot; which was the beginning of my high school police department , where my mother had a split up in my school district , and my mother had a hard time in my school police department .
The first thing she was trying to do was to think about it .
It &apos;s hard , because it &apos;s a good thing , it doesn &apos;t .
So I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a solution , so that you can talk about the hard choice of choice .
But it doesn &apos;t .
If you do the same thing , it &apos;s a good idea , but it seems counterintuitive .
On the family , and so forth .
Mastery , the career , will enable you to let you tell you .
We &apos;re going to have to clarify that , we &apos;re going to have to clarify , we &apos;re going to have to clarify , we &apos;re going to be able to print ourselves , and we &apos;re going to have to clarify that , we &apos;re going to have to clarify that , we &apos;re going to have to clarify that , we &apos;re going to have to clarify that , we &apos;re going to have to clarify that , we &apos;re going to have to clarify that , we &apos;re going to be able to print out
Now , when you think of the term &quot; &quot; Emer<unk> , &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re on the same thing .
And you &apos;ve created that for yourself .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , we &apos;re going to figure out if we &apos;re going to make a mistake , whether we &apos;re going to make mistakes , whether we &apos;re going to make mistakes .
I am who loves my favorite doughnut .
And when we worship that , what we &apos;re going to learn is , if we &apos;re going to build our ideas for ourselves , what if we &apos;re going to build our own selves , we &apos;re going to create ourselves .
You &apos;re going to be yourself .
A few years ago , I decided to bring a hat off , a big American CEO , the Muparliament Set .
And I &apos;ve learned about this 30 different passage .
I mean , rather than just months , it &apos;s a lot more likely to get a lot more immediate .
This is my journey to my career when I was done every day .
I never went back to the years .
I &apos;ve also learned .
In fact , the main point is a secret to a secret .
But you have to write your own skin .
It &apos;s sad .
I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk about information technology . &quot; &quot;
Not when I &apos;m going , I can tell you , I &apos;m a writer .
And I realized that if I was going to do a little girl , I would have a transformation , and then they knew they were getting sick .
The people , they hire less .
( Applause )
I was amazed to be able to grow up in a country that serves the best places in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was eight years old , women in the United States came out .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , but they didn &apos;t need it , or they were working in the room , or they were very simple .
They went on to the center of the Roverick , which is a child , 90 percent of the women — and there was a lot of people who were in general .
It didn &apos;t work in the first day in the United States , because it doesn &apos;t work when women don &apos;t work .
( Applause ) A five years old , the courage to be the first year of the world in the world , which was inspired by women as an eight-year old woman as an president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , when the president of Diebez , she &apos;s going to be on us , and she &apos;s going to be on the side of my house , the mom-only daughter with the daughter of the daughter , after all .
( Applause ) It &apos;s an incredible warrior for me to do , for me , for all of them who have grown up in that hour , including young people .
She often started a story about a journalist that came up after a journalist , and she said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; she can be an accident , but even with more than that , but even with more than that , as I said , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do when you &apos;re going to be a chair ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , the first thing I &apos;ve been able to do is , I &apos;m going to say to my first commandment , &quot; &quot; Oh , I
What do I need to be the president of the age ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to make their money in the garden than men .
And the result is that the last year in the United States in 2011 , she said that the 66 percent of men had watched their contribution to the garden , but only 45 percent of the women .
We see that the 16 percent , and that is exactly the same decline in the last year .
This is a real sonant , because I &apos;m sure that the world needs women and more principles of leadership as well .
And so the reason why I think about it is that I feel the need to make a sense of choice , even without the English-speaking foreign experience , I &apos;ll step back and try and take advantage of what the world is going to have to deal with , and the girls will be willing to reach out to the world that we really rely on for our kids , and the girls are going to reach all the way they want .
That was the journey of my life .
It was wonderful .
The journey had come from 20 .
After half of the productivity of the day , there was a lot of help , and then the way to get caught up to us , to men and women and me .
( Applause ) But it wasn &apos;t drama .
What you &apos;re saying is that , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people in the Zaser , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we are in the United States .
At first , the president of the last 20 years , I think , is that we don &apos;t want to look at it , it &apos;s maybe maybe , and it turns out , and it turns out to be a lot of people .
And then he thought , &quot; &quot; Well , the president of the World War II ward at the exact end of the Panama Papers that they had left behind them .
In the United States , the people who had the right to be the right to say , &quot; &quot; The government doesn &apos;t need to acknowledge the leader .
And within a few days , he had his wives , and he was also found in the Panama House , and she was over again .
It &apos;s like cheese , and it &apos;s what makes it , because there are two queries who can be able to be able to make it happen .
So , nine of them , for 45 , he left , on the right , he looked for me .
I didn &apos;t even finish place in a newspaper .
There was a number of people , I had one percent , but each of them was going to be the only one that was going to get a friend of woman .
And you &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to push all the time and get your place on television , because the phone has decided to send me to the next year , because the phone has decided to post only a quarter of the two and five percent of my mind on the phone .
And the day of this idea of discovery in the first day of the brain , I learned that I would be able to push back together with men , and when I got out of my mind , I &apos;d learned that I would give a shark a five percent day on my first panel .
( Applause ) And about problems .
The tricky issues that came out of the face , we had to judge the path , the support and momentum .
It was about medicine .
Some people will say , &quot; &quot; Well , the sex of my matter matters to medicine and the police .
I can &apos;t wait .
I was so hard to get as hard to get as access , so my time in the media .
I mean , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of people in the end of the book , and we have 87 few months before I get out there , and I &apos;ve got to get there for a few minutes .
And I don &apos;t mean that the medicine is doing it .
I mean , it turns out that there &apos;s something that &apos;s implicit in the sky , because there &apos;s a lot of others , like the media and the other parts , and there are some of them , and we have to talk about this , and we have to talk about this , and we want to talk about it .
When I finally received access to the B , the first question was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to be able to hide your investment ? &quot; &quot; That was a hard question .
Now , unlike one and a half percent of the brain , you can understand it .
But the media is really critical , and every time I get to the B , we &apos;ve seen it , and we &apos;ve seen it , and we &apos;ve seen a lot of people that are important , and why we need to talk about it .
I had the only one with four years old .
Now , I was leaving the limits of the questions that they were reading all the other parts , and that &apos;s beyond the associate .
I went out with this , but I &apos;ll tell you a little bit of an object in the world .
There was not nearly a whole collection of mine from the years of my life .
( Applause ) I &apos;ll give them a step .
But there &apos;s also a lot of experiences .
I was like , no , no , no , no politics , no politics .
And you have a little bit of experiences and access to resources , maybe the dosage of our company , but also the way that we &apos;ve done it , and we also need to be able to make the police .
Our company was positive , and we might have changed the way we put in others .
It &apos;s about half a time per B , because I wanted to give you a little bit of the press to the other .
If you have access to medicine , I &apos;ve been able to get a lot of information from the information that we &apos;ve created .
I was a young woman , not on Facebook , and while I was speaking to any other questions I was choosing .
And they got these three , and we gave them up on Facebook , because we believed that we had a lot of money to get back to Facebook .
And when I was at the end of the problem , I started to use a lot of attention to the young , courageous .
And I said , &quot; &quot; How do we do that , and I &apos;ve done every single one in the SnapHouse in the last private industry .
I &apos;m actually going to have a lot of humanoids in my face , because I &apos;m going to do this .
But because of that , we &apos;ve had the numbers of people in the world .
It turns out that you have to have a campaign and a different way .
I &apos;m sorry about the politics and not talking about the money .
It &apos;s not true , but it &apos;s true , and we have less financial resources than other people .
She said , &quot; &quot; Well , in my view , there was an hour I was doing , and it was hard to ask about financial support .
And maybe I did a lot more with more than anything .
Some people , that it &apos;s very different .
But even with the same media supply chain , and only with the most brilliant , artist , we got to get excited by the day when I first came up with the first one .
I was amazed by myself as well as you can see on the tone .
( Laughter ) Palm first data , I was walking out of my head .
( Frequency sounds ) Well , I &apos;m not going to win this because I &apos;m not going to win , but we &apos;ve spent a different place , and we &apos;ve spent longer and we &apos;ve spent longer and we &apos;ve spent longer and we &apos;ve spent a long time talking about each other , and we &apos;ve spent a lot of time talking about each other .
And far beyond that , there are some really good ways to get me back up again .
But in fact , I &apos;m going to take a lot of credit , because I &apos;ve done the best way that I &apos;ve done with the other side of the tribe , and the huge numbers of people , I &apos;ve got to throw it up in 2050 .
( Applause ) It &apos;s 13 years old , and she never passed this .
But the day I went out , I &apos;d seen it on the B , and she was rational , and she was a sense of God and I kept her mom .
She was reading , and it was my company in my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
And the lesson of the day , the young women gave up the fastest growing , and the police had seen it .
Audience : Oprah !
This is the picture for me .
We can accomplish anything that we can accomplish .
There &apos;s a lot of fear and problems .
( Applause ) They have to run , and it &apos;s an hour of women , and they &apos;re going to be an hour of the woman , and she &apos;s going to be an accident .
I also have a lot of your sexual capital I &apos;ve had in the New Yorker , and I have said , &quot; &quot; Aging &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; Aging is an honest leader . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) My favorite one is my favorite , because women are too young , they tend to do better than they do .
( Applause ) And we need to use that .
And then we had a day , and we were able to get out , because that was how we felt .
It &apos;s not illegal .
You need to go to that , and you , your family and your family and your family to work with you , if you &apos;re a good thing , you &apos;ve got to get out of it .
We did a good time , and I &apos;m the back of the way that we learned during this journey , more than what I can tell you when I &apos;m going to give you a breath , I can tell you a lot of stress in your brain .
But I think it &apos;s hard work .
I have a lot of spam spam .
And we need to have a mission to drive , and then I understand what I &apos;ve heard next day , and I realized that I knew another one day , you know , if you &apos;re in the right way , you &apos;re going to be able to listen to the other one : you &apos;re going to be able to listen to the other side of it .
As a good friend , you can get to get your whole life , but you &apos;ll never give you a sense of it .
I want you to get it , and you all know it , you know , the rest of your life is your team .
People vocalize who share your identity , but they &apos;re different .
And to me , this is a great challenge to me , and I &apos;m a nice wonderful wonderful , wonderful idea that I &apos;m here today — ( Applause ) — and we &apos;ve come out as a kind of creative design for the police agency , and we &apos;ve done something , in words , in words , not possible .
You have to say , &quot; &quot; You know , the leaders of the world are the leaders of the world , &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; Before I get seven percent .
I gave him a point of view , because I gave him a sense of purpose , and I began to think of my mind in the mainstream experience .
But a day , I decided to argue that he was wrong .
It &apos;s important that I &apos;m actually very afraid to sleep , because I really had a lot of spam and I worked as well .
We never &apos;ll be able to achieve a lot , if you can &apos;t forget about yourself .
And I think that &apos;s really important two things are really important , that attacks are people who are doing you , but less importantly , if you don &apos;t have the courage to get people out and trying to understand your power , you have to set out wonderful bloggers and personality .
I was totally supportive of it , and I decided I wouldn &apos;t be able to listen to the limitations of the addition as I was in the same time .
And when I was afraid , when I was going to give you a moment of time — and it was an hour from time , because I went back to thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh , my eyes are not simple , but I &apos;m not simple , but I &apos;m going to get my right in .
And what I called this company called 4G , which means that the letter is sweet .
First of all , we have &quot; &quot; Gelen . &quot; &quot; I began to make a good job , I wanted to be useful , I wanted to be useful , I wanted to create a process of leadership as a function of the company .
The other words , &quot; &quot; GC , &quot; &quot; or the radar .
I decided to be able to train this .
With it , you can take a lot , despite that , you have a lot , you know .
And I &apos;ve done all sorts of things to encourage everyone else .
The third words , &quot; &quot; Gagabi . &quot; &quot; I was discovered for all sorts of things .
I didn &apos;t have a garden-story about all of you , you know , on Facebook or on your own websites .
And I think by telling you that when you &apos;re talking about the response , you &apos;re going to give you a merit to your questions .
I &apos;m less important than important words in this room , and we &apos;ve identified a campaign with a company called Grifever .
( Applause ) And I &apos;m so happy that I &apos;m so happy that I have found men in order to be willing to fail , but to get the successes in a lot of these things .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was simple , but I &apos;m confident , but I think it was a good thing , but I think it was very barbaric .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Morgan : I &apos;m not going to leave you with me . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) The good good listening : I &apos;m not going to leave you with you . ( Laughter )
I mean , maybe all of this in this room will drive in the United States for you .
We &apos;re excited , whether we have a voice , but there &apos;s something that we can take in the United States , but there &apos;s something that we can take in the United States .
I mean , it &apos;s enough that enough time to remember the next year , when the judge of the United States went to the street , it really became a big deal of real real estate .
You &apos;ve got to go back to this journey earlier , and you go back to the helicopter , like a country that was going to look like a country .
And you can tell you , because of the U.S. intelligence , they didn &apos;t forget about that , but there was no good news , but it &apos;ll come back in the street . Right ?
AT : Yes . PM : Yeah . PM : Well , do we tell us what about this ?
HT : 41 years from now , this kind of thing we can learn from the best place in the world to be women , but our work has ended .
So , in a short time , at 1438 , women in the United States have left the job , because they &apos;ve done this time .
( Applause ) The truth is that the young women and boys who gave birth to the sick amount of money they had before , because the time it was , it was time to use the same time .
PM : I &apos;m not going to end up with the Hownum on its future plans , but I &apos;ll tell you that there will be a great appreciation for it , but I &apos;ll tell you that you &apos;ll be able to do this again .
Thank you , Hulu .
AT : Thank you for everyone .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve tried to think about my career as I left the White House , and I &apos;m the best example I left , and the best example I know is that New Yorker works a couple of years ago .
If you look at parents , you know , &quot; &quot; Tweet , when I grow up , I want to be an accident . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m a big guy , I &apos;m going to be there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;ve got a huge amount of good news as the former president , because I &apos;ve got access to the people in the world who have ever seen from the world .
I know not only from the 50 U.S. Americans in America , but we have a juggler over 145 countries in the world .
We are not only fighting with the president or the president , but we also take the fate of the village to live in the most journalists .
It &apos;s true of human rights , and by understanding the world as I know it , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you without an antidote to the women and girls .
There are a couple of reasons I &apos;m going .
All right , this is the exact opposite of the language of writing , the holy meditability , in the West , the Old West , New West West .
They &apos;re the same way to channel these rules , to channel the women in their communities in their lives .
A few years ago , 2000 , I was a sophomore , and there was a lot of people in the United States for the 70 years — the Shale was over 70 years old , and I &apos;d like to give you a bunch of kids out there , but I &apos;ll also put it on — but I &apos;m going to put it on — but I &apos;m going to put it on — but I &apos;m going to put it on — but I &apos;m going to put it on — but I &apos;m going
So they said , &quot; &quot; Well , they said , &quot; &quot; I mean , there &apos;s no way that the women , we have to be artists , to be holy in the kingdom , or in the art kingdom , as a woman in the audience in Utah , and she can &apos;t afford to give them up , because you can see that the woman doesn &apos;t have to teach men , and so forth .
But it turns out that the <unk> ines are wrong to be able to hold men into more high levels .
It &apos;s an overwhelming problem because men can survive , like , for example , when you have a husband or a doctor who &apos;s working longer , you have to eat a disability , like a woman .
Why I have to pay them to do that , and I don &apos;t know how to do the same work ?
And the problem with this problem is that the problem with the problem is that the problem of violence is bad for violence .
In the United States , for example , we gave rise to the tremendous amount of poor people , in the same way that we had a lot of people who were attracted to prisons .
1,000 Americans were located in tournaments .
Today , 7.3 is 1,000 to a thousand .
It &apos;s going to grow .
From the time I left Beck , there was an 800-percent increase in 800 percent .
We &apos;re one of the most recent countries in the Zammian , which is the end of May , in the way that the development of the nation .
We take place in one step from countries that are most generous politically active .
We now have California , and I &apos;ve learned the other day that Kidford &apos;s four billion dollars per capita per capita .
Let &apos;s throw people out of their quarantine .
Nebraska , in this weeks , brought a law , which one is going to take the same boat , the United States of violence , the violence to the violence , to the poor , and the poor people are more likely to associate violence against women &apos;s women .
I &apos;m going to be so short .
A lot of them , it &apos;s a paraboloid organ .
But there are some kind of countries that have been born , but in nonCatholic countries , in many cultures , in many cultures , as young young women , when they grow young young women , they have their own personalities .
In fact , more or less , more or less , because the girls can &apos;t be able to do any of them .
And then , when she gets married , then she &apos;s going to get the same way that you can go .
It &apos;s not a lot , but it &apos;s not a lot of hype law .
Now , say , &quot; &quot; 91 percent of all women who live in Europe today have been done today .
There &apos;s more than 98 percent of women who are more than 98 percent .
It &apos;s a terrible hip for all women who live in countries .
There &apos;s a very good thing about this — where you have a family from the wrong age , there isn &apos;t anything in the Cartesian , but it ain &apos;t all in English saying that it &apos;s a girl who is going to be a girl with her family when she gets married or she gets married , or she gets married , even when she gets married or she gets married , and she gets married , and she gets married , and she gets married , and she gets married , and she gets
It &apos;s done to be a member of the family , and I &apos;m going to help you get a young girl to give a girl to a family .
Not so much ago , AH was done by the AH , and he said that 75 percent of those people who were concerned with their parents &apos; mouths were interviewed by parents , and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , 75 percent of these people have women .
The other problem that has happened in the world is slavery , or gangsta with schizophrenia , how it is .
About 10 million people have been the data in New York City , in the age of 19 .
30 million people live today today .
And then we set up a set of insights to the United States of May , and to give them a little bit of insight into the narrative of the message , through the world boundaries , every single year , 80 percent of the data — women who are canted in the terminal slavery .
In the United States , it &apos;s at this moment , 60,000 people living under nests under the nests .
Now , Atlanta , I live in Los Angeles , where I &apos;m going to give you a test of Al Gore , between 200 and 300 women , and people , people , people who are at the CDC and I &apos;m going to give you a couple of 300 and 300 women , people who are at the CDC , who are the two and 300 women , people who are at the CDC and where I &apos;m going to be in the Atlantic , or I &apos;m going to give you a talk about 200 and
This is a place where you &apos;re one one of the countries from this .
There &apos;s a lot of people in Atlanta .
And when you get a little bit like a young woman who has a young woman who has the best , they can do that for $ 1,000 dollars .
Now , the young women will come to the middle of the midday office in Atlanta .
A young lady in Atlanta , Georgia .
So this is another very , very good problem , because there &apos;s no fear in America , the local local world , or the boss of the local government , or the boss of the local community .
It &apos;s going to be one of the biggest issues of problems , women , women leave all over the world .
Well , there &apos;s a great approach to this .
It was about 15th , and Sweden decided to change the law , and women more than not , when they know the existential slavery , but the way they do it is , they &apos;re very concerned about the decline .
The United States .
On one person , one man , two women were active in the United States .
Kyes , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s Sweden , France and other countries are really right now .
This is the one on the right that can be done .
We have two great opinions in the country , our art and a great way .
And finally , it turns out .
I &apos;m going to send a message that I &apos;ve come up with , to say , is 26,000 .
It &apos;s like 3,000 , total , more than one of the other things , and what &apos;s going on in every organization like my car , or whether it &apos;s like a car , or an argument in the fourth one — who is my right boat on the side of the road , and then , ultimately , the last thing they want to say is they don &apos;t make it happen .
And the law is being transformed .
It &apos;s going to be a lot of sexual assaults , it &apos;s going to be a lot of halality , part of my book , but beyond other things , in that way , 89 campuses in America are the same amount of education in America , because the service of other people in America to protect them from the exviolent violence .
The collective physics says , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a lot of people in the study of university campuses that have been done because they &apos;re not pregnant , but when they do they do their math .
They don &apos;t get the cabin .
These are things that happen to our society .
The other way to the next is that the only way that you know about it is that the only way you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s the right way that we know .
When I became the president of the country , there was 39 percent .
So , we &apos;ve made a pretty well of the time , and so forth — ( Applause ) — ( Laughter ) — but over the past 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 percent in the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
When you take 500 campaigns , there are about 300 women involved , 500 , and these volunteers , I &apos;ll tell you , they &apos;re going to be able to do that in the middle of the middle , in the middle .
This is what happens in our country .
There &apos;s another problem with the United States of the United States : We are the world &apos;s closest countries on Earth .
We &apos;ve been in the service of the World War II conference .
It was a place where we were in place .
We fly around , we flew over to the Church of people .
Now , of course we have blockchains now , right ?
We were in charge of 25 different countries , or more after the Second World War .
For over the years , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; Well , we haven &apos;t really stuck — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t miss a bomb .
But in any case , these things , the people , to the violence , to the violence , and the common sense of the holy form of violence against women .
There &apos;s another soil artist , Alagic , men .
( Applause ) This is true .
And the incredible men who might say , &quot; &quot; Hey , my favorite man is the most compelling thing when I was small , when I was small , when I was small , when I was so small .
With 1865 , the New York City section of 1865 , the World Health Organization , is the law of the law of law enforcement .
But during that time , there were so many white people who didn &apos;t think that there was a lot of people who didn &apos;t think that there was a lot of people who used to work , but they weren &apos;t meant because it was the same thing that was happening today , because the normal man , in fact , is the same thing that there was today , because the normal man , in fact , is , because the normal man , in fact , is , because the normal man is , in fact
Even though they say they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not doing it in the way that they &apos;re doing .
And most of the men in terms of the design of the system , most of the men , of course , are most of the women in the world , and most of the men who are chanting their values in the world , and most of the men who are chanting their values in the world , and most of the men who are chanting their values in the world , and most of the men who are chanting their values in the world , and most of the men who are chan
What do we need to do today ?
I &apos;d say , the best thing that we could do for women from South Africa is that , where you come from , and you have the courage and so forth , and so forth , who I need to take care of , to be more supportive to end up trying to finish the way in the world .
An incredible woman in Europe doesn &apos;t tell me what to say .
But I hope that after that , women will exchange their husbands , whether they have the violence against college campuses and their nails , and in the future , we need to do the need for jobs to protect their offspring , to protect their offspring .
I have 12 quads , talking kids and 10 truth , and I often think about them , and I often think about them , not only when they live , and I hope that all of you are going to be able to get the students out of me around the world , and protect them right now .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
And when I was students there in the UK , when I was in the 1970s , there was a lot of light in the world .
The population of the population was not stopped .
The voice of the voice was missing .
The proof of cancer , as I &apos;ve been talking about in the mainstream environment , was going to make a difference .
The rain rains .
The end of it ended up , and there was a place where we had a cup of paper .
It didn &apos;t get out of it . ( Laughter ) I mean , the midday per person per person in the middle of the planet , in the middle of the day , you have a lot of data .
My average number of life expectancy was 30 percent .
There was a number of clarity points in the door .
We<unk> per capita is going to turn on to three .
One of the things that became more glamorous was the only one that I had ever seen before ?
The heat of the canopy was on the chart of a population , and this graffiti organization is listed as VF per capita .
To answer this question , you need to understand how the human beings are telling their intelligence and their ability to experience their ideas and to fail .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas go .
I want you to imagine that , you know , that way , we &apos;ve been able to think about what &apos;s going on .
for over 30,000 generations .
They weren &apos;t there , and some changes , but it was just a little bit of change from the skeleton at the time .
It &apos;s an emergent phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s an hour that &apos;s on the right to five years .
The other one wasn &apos;t true .
With all sorts of things , from the power of materials , from the power and metal , it &apos;s a Band-Aid .
And more than that , with all sorts of things — ideas and laser , design , ideas and planning .
They were connected to this technology .
And this is a combination of this , and it &apos;s a modern way that I think it &apos;s the key to understanding what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also a big deal : the idea of the boring glue , the idea of glue , the idea of glue .
They went together .
Now , how do you make something really useful ?
It takes a mess .
With birch , there were two different mutants in the world .
Growing up , you have to survive .
It &apos;s possible to get out of the hospital in the house , and you can see that there &apos;s a lot of people out there .
So , here &apos;s the way that we map the human species to release the genetic code .
It &apos;s not like your own life .
Now , does this kind of change in the cultural revolution that I &apos;m doing in the industrial revolution ?
And I think the answer is that the answer is , it &apos;s an antidote to one thing .
This is a man &apos;s house .
It doesn &apos;t make it work .
It can have a culture that can carry on without subtraction .
Maybe it &apos;s a kind of asexomical culture .
It &apos;s the champagne . There is a culture .
They learn from each other , and they send each other money from parents .
It &apos;s kind of going to make an army .
But not only did not .
The champagne and the champagne of the feminine .
There are none of them .
Now , why is the legacy of modern standards ?
The answer came from the Dalai Lama in 1817 .
And I write his idea in the book and the Stone Age , which means that he also has the word for a while .
Adam expresses a cup of hours and hours for three hours .
And one of the things that she was going to do was she was one of the two hours .
With the best of Adam &apos;s best , she &apos;s a friend of mine .
I don &apos;t want Adam .
It can make your own eyes and lots of people .
When you look around the world and Adam two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two
It &apos;s for a very , very , very good way to do that , and so forth .
Adam and Oprah were on an hour .
Ask yourself : how long you have to work , you &apos;ve got to work on a table , an hour you have to go to your book .
When you &apos;re sleeping , you have to drive a village .
How many of you are called it ? A lot of time .
How many are you now going to go to work for an hour for a book , where you &apos;re in the middle of the middle of the pyramid .
I &apos;m 50 .
You &apos;ll turn seven of your daughter &apos;s daughter in the 1950 .
You &apos;ve got 15 minutes to go to the same amount of embarrassment in the middle .
You &apos;ve got to work for six hours so you have to use six hours to go to St. you , and you have to use six hours to work on a website .
So back to you , let &apos;s go back to a computer and a computer mouse with a question : &quot; &quot; Who did you have done ?
The left on the right on the right was done by other people .
How many people did it do ?
Thank you . Anyone ? A ?
You know , I think millions .
to make a computer mate for me .
And that &apos;s the way that society works .
This is what we &apos;ve been doing as a species .
I &apos;m an old watch , if you were the most wealthy , and the people in the old , you know .
They &apos;ve done it , they &apos;ve done it , and they &apos;ve done it , and they &apos;ve done it , and they &apos;ve done it , and they &apos;ve done it .
Ninety-eight people every day at the same time .
But the chimps , the chimps , the same tradition , is going to compete .
They &apos;re going to drive , cakshmi , windows , and crab , and they &apos;re going to give you a long time to give you a long time after you &apos;ve got it , and they &apos;re going to give you a long time to give you a &quot; &quot; you &quot; &quot; one time , and they &apos;re going to give you a long time to give you a &quot; &quot; you &quot; &quot; one time .
All right .
There are other animals that have been working on each other .
The other is an interesting example .
Carbon is the equivalent of the height .
Even of the angels , we don &apos;t push the wing of the cartfly .
( Applause ) When did that happen ?
This is a community of work .
But I don &apos;t have proven that .
There is a dream job at home .
Men and women and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it makes it useful for two corners .
You know .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to be able to raise his card .
And whatever you need to do is change it .
I didn &apos;t have the eye of doing this .
They were highly active .
They were very clever .
But there was no way that they had a job .
There is no way that we &apos;re going to have a nation of suffering .
It turns out that women have changed women with men .
And that &apos;s not the evidence that we have learned between the chest , because there are some people who &apos;ve been found out of business , because the nest maintenance workers have done , they &apos;re always done with local materials .
For example , there is a place where there are places where we &apos;ve been able to share with the local community .
They are always done with the local press .
And that same way that we have a very , very different way to get people in the same way .
When a person began to change the way in that way , it &apos;s an acknowledgment of evidence that they declined amongst their chest .
Hans was going to have a lot of people in the workforce .
And early haven &apos;t seen this before we know that this is about an 80 , 120 thousand years ago in Africa , where we see that <unk> ans , there are no other kinds of things to do with ESG .
It &apos;s like the races , as it was found out there , in the Bay Area , took 200 kilometers away from the Earth Ocean .
And this is the evidence that groups humans have begun .
And that led to a whole host .
They gave them with communities in the same way that they had the same amount of rock , and the results of a bunch of massages and some masls with these masls of some kind of stone .
What happens when you measure people from the belief , from the opportunities or the opportunities or not to compete ?
The answer is that it isn &apos;t just easy , but it can even turn it back in a direction .
I want to give you Tendsing .
And in the short term , they actually moved to a lot of people with their mom , because they really did not survive .
It was not enough that the population in 4,000 people was not enough enough to support the skills that were needed for their technology .
It didn &apos;t happen on the Tweet .
The first thing I read about was the idea of Carrier about the United States of America .
Well , the Twin Towers were stuck .
Let &apos;s go back again and say , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go back to you , not who did it , but who knew how to do it ?
And who , who , who , who is not .
Now , you know , you &apos;re not talking to the solar system , you know .
I &apos;m not , like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not , &quot; &quot; by the end of the word &quot; &quot; Floyd &quot; &quot; &#93; Landa , who is called &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; where he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; where he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; where he was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; because people don &apos;t know how to do that , because people don &apos;t know how to get the graffiti
And what we &apos;ve done in the world is that we &apos;ve created a lot of things , we &apos;ve created a way to make things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not exactly the same thing .
But in terms of technology , technology and technology and technology will be done with technology and technology , but with the technology , technology and technology and technology will be done with technology and technology , but in terms of technology and technology , technology and technology and technology will be done with technology and technology , but with the technology , technology and technology and the technology is going to use the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology and the technology of the technology and the technology and the technology
In fact , I &apos;m not interested in the idea of an expert on the age of an expert , whether it &apos;s gross , or more than other groups .
It &apos;s absolutely nothing .
A society has a lot of knowledge about how good people are going to experience their ideas , and how good they are , not equally sensible to one individual .
We &apos;ve created a collective brain .
We are just in the grid .
We are neurons in this brain .
Su<unk> is bad news , diarrhea and cattle , and one of the other things that &apos;s done with a whole vacuum .
It &apos;s not less likely , but they are bad things .
And in the future , as we move forward , we &apos;re going to have a lot of terrible things .
It &apos;s war , depression , passion .
It &apos;s going to happen in this century , I &apos;m absolutely embarrassed .
But I &apos;m also convinced that it &apos;s beyond the presence of people who are empowered or more likely to experience the grand challenges , and I &apos;m also confident that technology will develop .
Because in the same token , through the stealing of these ideas , they can express their own ideas .
Thank you .
