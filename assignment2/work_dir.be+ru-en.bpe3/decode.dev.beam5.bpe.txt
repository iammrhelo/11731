( Arabic ) I &apos;m looking for Al@@ bat@@ in the same way as Sarah Al@@ len@@ e , and in the United States , Al@@ len@@ e and the West .
I was born in the middle of the audience .
It was five years old when he died of his father , but when I was born , I was born .
There was no difference , they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother born 16 children .
With 16 children , only five children saved .
And imagine who was childhood .
I &apos;ve seen the day I &apos;ve seen women who have passed on , or kids who have been trained to experience what they want .
When I graduated from the middle of the middle school , when I graduated from the middle of the high school , I ended when I graduated from the middle of the middle school , when I graduated from the middle of the high school , when I graduated from the middle of the high school , if I graduated from the middle of the high school , I ended when I graduated from the middle of the high school , when I graduated from the middle of the high school , when I graduated from the middle school
I wanted to be the doctr@@ ines to help women .
So I ended up going to school .
Sadly , my country wasn &apos;t the Internet of the girl , so I was hired to get it done , but I couldn &apos;t do it .
And my father gave me to America .
I moved to America .
I ended my education .
And I started talking , and my country came up , and I had a meeting .
You know , when I graduated from college , I didn &apos;t even know what happened to my family and my country .
It was months later , but I didn &apos;t know anything .
My family was in the camps .
And as soon as I ended up learning , I &apos;d lost my family in America .
I wanted them to survive .
Was it my heart ?
My heart was in Africa .
When I observed what was happening in my country , my heart was the same .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that .
I did .
I gave you a university .
And I was here to the camp .
When I landed on the camp , in P@@ act , I saw 7@@ .5 million of them . 7@@ .5 million .
About 90 percent of them women were women and kids who were teenagers , and they were teenagers , and you know if I was in the camps , I was a lot of people who were women .
When I spent every day , I found things that you might not be thinking about .
I saw five children kids who sat down and crying , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a young woman who couldn &apos;t afford to go , no education , a funny thing , didn &apos;t even have a place to go .
I saw young boys who were crying out of their parents and their pets , and they were the voices of their parents , and they were the voices of their parents , and their parents and their pets , and their parents and their parents , and their parents and their parents , and I saw the boys who were crying and their parents and their pets , and their parents were crying , and they &apos;d see their parents .
It was very , very negative .
So at that moment , we &apos;re talking about momentum .
At that moment , I asked myself , &quot; What can I do for these people ? &quot;
How can I help them ?
At that moment , I realized that education changed my life .
It changed me , gave me a status .
And at that point , I realized that I had to use my college education , and I started to work on that .
What was I easy ?
Not , because at that moment of education , there was a whole bunch of young girls .
And because R@@ est@@ ro@@ v@@ <unk> was an Afghan poet .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; I want to do that .
Did you get me ? Na@@ tively , not .
This is why I had to have a date in this country .
How do I do that ?
I was a legal student , and I was looking for it .
I was breaking down .
I was 80 years old .
He was the strength .
I came up with it in the camps .
He looked at me and she said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; A woman was mad . How can I be teachers ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do a teacher . &quot; &quot; And when I started with his actions , the news was that I started growing up .
We had 25 schools , 15,000 kids , and 15,000 kids who had these schools , and that was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you .
Now , we work , we work , we judge our teachers , and we give people right to the right women , right ?
I was at the exact same time , I was in front of my office .
And I saw a lot of people who had come up to the room , open doors to the door , open doors to me : &quot; &quot; Come on . &quot; &quot; When that &apos;s what you do ?
You stick . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know , you know what &apos;s going on .
But you have to be male .
You have to mu@@ ster and you have a fashion .
I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
So I gave them to myself .
They came up . There we go .
( Laughter ) Now , people are passionate people .
I gave them to me , and I put them together .
They said they were not going to steal it .
Nat@@ ur@@ ally , they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , they talk to me , too .
But I was embarrassed , and I was male .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
What are you going to do here ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them — ( Laughter ) — I just looked at them , and they said , &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked a little girl out there . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is the wrong thing .
We are going to push some students out there .
And the Koran says , &quot; &quot; You know , if you put the K@@ ir@@ mouth woman , ( Laughter ) they started talking to the folder .
And at that moment , I went back to the bars , and they came up and began to shake .
And then the leaders started pouring out .
And there are 3,000 students in the field , and we &apos;ve kept putting out .
They were able to address the drivers .
I was driving with mom and kids .
They &apos;ve been trained to over@@ grow our health .
And we &apos;ve done all of the friction that you can imagine .
I was happy , and I was doing my work .
And one day , four months old , one teacher , and I moved to the south of Kabul , and I went to the end of the night , and I ended up leaving the death of the age 19 .
With the lights on the beach , they moved to us .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And my kid came up and said , &quot; I can answer it .
What do you need ?
This time we &apos;re going .
And yet , it comes to the moment when you have to be powerful .
You have to run .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
Once upon a period of time , we &apos;re able to do it .
I went and I said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you drive you back . &quot; &quot; I came up with a car , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll give you a ride . &quot; &quot; And I came up with a car , and I sat down , and I sat down , and I sat down , and I sat down , and I sat down , and I sat down , and they said , &quot; &quot;
In order to bring them to school , what they do is that we need to invest in schools , and what others do .
You come home to house . No .
I was only a kid . I lost the voice .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; What do I need to do ?
They took hundreds of women to get education .
Now , I was a little bit , and I guess at this point , we talk about the momentum — at this point , one of my great old fathers in the same moment that I was born in the same moment .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sa@@ tis@@ fied ? &quot; &quot; I said it .
She said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What did you do with this ? &quot;
But it &apos;s a trick , it doesn &apos;t get me .
You &apos;ll help them . &quot; &quot; They took off .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure I &apos;m a teacher .
Human beings are my best .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
This is the knowledge that the transformation of people .
When you study people , when you study people , if you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people , when you study people
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) General potential women women potential women , ( Laughter ) the potential potential women women have potential women &apos;s potential , ( Laughter ) potential women , women potential women , ( Laughter ) who has potential women to women . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m confident .
I live in a country , not a good job , and I live .
Let me just share with you a little bit .
This was happening to a country .
We were able to do it .
You know what happened in my country ?
People can &apos;t come out of the house , they don &apos;t have to put their safety .
But we want to go back to our old-fashioned Afghan .
They get a breath , and they &apos;re going to go .
And so jumps to see , it &apos;s going to continue .
I want to share with you that I &apos;m going to share with you that I &apos;ll share with you with you .
It said that compassion and love can be bent .
Like , &quot; &quot; Do you want to steal ?
K@@ T : Um , let &apos;s look .
S@@ et : Pr@@ osp@@ ect : Pr@@ osp@@ ect , the cru@@ sts of the cru@@ sters of data , the cru@@ sts from the back of the drug , the cr@@ ab@@ ans of the cr@@ ats , &quot; &quot; The cr@@ anks of the Party , &quot; &quot; with the fer@@ ment of K@@ opping , with the politics of the protected world , and then the balloons .
K@@ SM : I mean , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to finish up with a lot of stuff .
St@@ ev@@ er : Sh@@ o ?
So we have a data high .
K@@ T : Well , D@@ ama@@ sc@@ us the pin@@ ky , and the Dalai Lama .
S@@ et : It &apos;s probably going faster .
I &apos;m going to send your orders .
( Applause ) My P@@ ong : I &apos;m a painting of a couple of years old , and I &apos;m a painting of the multiverse , and I &apos;m a painting of cartoons , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of diversity in the canopy .
Well , I learned who &apos;s not like English .
And they had a program called a program , who was most of them not knowing .
And when I realized that An@@ im@@ ics were the ones that make cartoons that I &apos;d like to look at on the screen , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I want to be an opponent . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I could hear it , or I don &apos;t know , but it was a great moment of my life .
Non@@ sense of angiogenesis and grit have always been their favorite thing .
But the final idea of the computer technology has been born with &quot; &quot; Women &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) on my computer , it was a virus that I was working on , and I was doing it , and I was thinking , what if there was my little lights out there in the middle ?
Now , what &apos;s going on there is going to be a lot of people who are going to get together ?
So we &apos;ve born &quot; &quot; Women &quot; &quot; .
When I was four years old , I told myself how to plant computers , to the parts and my nan@@ ny .
This is how I got there . &quot; &quot; This is what &apos;s going on .
The first time I was the Internet connection I was building on H@@ T@@ M@@ M@@ L , and now I &apos;m going to play a TED Talk .
I &apos;m also going to build a new way that I &apos;m going to call &quot; &quot; Ani@@ ma@@ ss . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees , and what they do is we have to know what they &apos;ve had , and why they &apos;re useful .
If flowers don &apos;t survive these things , then all of the things that are going on , we &apos;re going to be on , you know , we &apos;re going to get out of our voice .
So I decided to use these kinds of jobs , and I decided to use these kinds of super-@@ heroes .
( Applause ) ( Piano ) ( Music ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ! ( Music )
We need to end with the Al@@ man .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , I started out with the story , but what is the idea ?
It can be inspired by the transformation .
The idea is to be able to innovate .
Thanks to the idea of a real world .
If not ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be there , we wouldn &apos;t be there , there was no tech , or the health of the health , the culture , our behavior .
When I was eight years old , I took my ideas and discovered the work of the LIGO , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; with them , &quot; &quot; The Academy of Engineering &#93;
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to grow up the escal@@ ation and the acronym .
I am 13 years old , and I don &apos;t even know what I &apos;ve done with my colleague in 2008 , my mom , my mom , my job .
Well , I &apos;d always been a historian of my art , and I wanted to bring it to the rest of my career , and I wanted to bring it back to it .
And if you look at the pieces of wood in the house , I thought to myself , I thought , you know , I &apos;ve had so much idea that I &apos;ve been able to make a piece of stuff .
I &apos;ve noticed that if I gave my date , I ended up on the street with a question I ended up on the street with a question : &quot; &quot; How do you make a look . Where can you write ? &quot; &quot; I noticed that if I gave you a break .
And I thought I was thinking about it , and I thought I could do it .
And therefore , I was only eight years old , and I wasn &apos;t there .
I just knew I wanted to raise my passion . I &apos;d like to share with you a little bit less than me , and I wanted to share with you much less for my life .
My mother taught me to go to my house and I &apos;d put my hair on my head and I &apos;d put it on my head , and I &apos;d write a call for every person in my head .
I started to build more choices like balloons and balloons .
It has begun to start making a bunch of people all over the world , and I &apos;ve got a click , and I &apos;ve got to think about it , and I &apos;ve got to think about it and other countries .
Well , I &apos;ve got a lot of research to learn about leadership , like , say , a lot of people to learn about leadership , and how to support relationships , and what is the best way to learn from it .
And I started out of course .
And one day , when I was 10 years old , I was related to the Forbes .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me and my firm in my work .
A lot of people who are trying to ask me , why do I have a deal of CO2 ?
With the little explosion , I was interested in the environment and what they were living .
My parents used to teach me how to share with , almost less , and with the shake .
I learned that the fabric of the fabric or even the process is not safe to people and the world , and I started my research , and I learned that even after that , there was a problem , and I learned that even after the other side of the problem .
From the course of the process , the early days of the art , or from the edges of the tissue .
It &apos;s the wind blowing up the wind , and what it is all about .
And so when I started with the office , I knew two things : All my entire life would have to be esoteric , and that 10 percent of my children are going to report the local world .
( Applause ) And I think I &apos;m a part of the new invention that I don &apos;t just want to make money , but it &apos;s the way that we can use the explosion of the world .
I believe that I can use my mentors , who is the best of the future generations in the future .
We live in a big way , we live , and from that , I &apos;m still more a little bit more like this .
It &apos;s not like that in the world , but it &apos;s not enough .
And you need to be able to do it through the heart , because that &apos;s why the idea of structure builds up .
And it turns out that the empowerment of the world and the notion of what is going on .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : You guys heard of Mao I talked about my parents , who had a list of women who had this list of women .
Now , when the Dalai Lama , cheese and P@@ an , can you — Val@@ ues .
( Applause )
This is a couple of observations about the core .
N@@ one@@ <unk> , you have a lot of stuff .
These are the changes that are these huge numbers of voices that are connected to each other .
Most of the falls that you see on the screen are not the only ones that you see on the screen , but it &apos;s not the same color .
Now , when you try to show you some of those insights , I think you &apos;ll notice that you &apos;re going to see what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s not only about living , but more than that , I think about it , I think about the core of our vocal selves , they &apos;re talking , and they &apos;re useful .
It &apos;s like the source of the world &apos;s source .
And there was a lab in the lab , in the lab , the meaning of the meaning of visualizing the experiment that you can post on .
And I think there are ways that we &apos;re talking about , and the first thing I want to talk about is something that you want to know , and then , in a way that you want to know .
How much is it ?
All right , this is to look at each other about the core of the head .
It &apos;s a lot of mass , and it turns out that holy that way , it turns out that it comes from the stress point of view that &apos;s happening .
And when you really look at it , you &apos;re going to see a lot of cool stuff about it .
To not be able to be able to think about it , it &apos;s not going to be a little bit more than one billion billion of them in the world .
It &apos;s very easy to be able to be able to be these systems .
But more than what they have , they have the data .
They &apos;re all embedded with their underlying system , and when you &apos;re lucky , we can think about them as a master version of the world .
And for a lot of questions that might have come from the world , say , &quot; How does it work ? &quot;
You can learn to learn how to learn these systems .
Well , that we were talking about the extraordinary times .
Second , these are these things .
So if you look at what &apos;s going on in the face of the nucleus of the head , and you can hold it all together , and then you get the same thing that you can see , and then you get this big , blah blah blah blah .
It &apos;s not true .
And what we see here is actually a fact that this is actually a combination of the sa@@ y@@ gen@@ icity .
And the whole question is : if it &apos;s not a voice , what if it &apos;s not a good thing , what does it do ?
And it &apos;s going to be a gas , a gas that &apos;s in a billion degrees — it &apos;s a fax .
And so you put that in the garage , you can find out on the stage .
Now , the stress response of these systems is the combination of what &apos;s causing them to generate value , and to wind up with a lot of weight , and by the height of the little bit , it &apos;s the wind .
This is the main point , but it &apos;s just science .
There is also a lot of other kinds of other kinds of things that are going on for us , which is still a little bit for us , and then , let &apos;s put it back , and let &apos;s put it in the same way that we don &apos;t even want to use it .
The third thing is learning very low .
To give you a talk about it , I &apos;m going to tell you about a way to tell the story .
Most of the world &apos;s mass is done not with attacks .
You gave you a date .
Most of the world &apos;s most likely to look at a very , very , very , very , very bizarre .
The price of content is something that isn &apos;t quite a good thing , but it &apos;s not a very good way to pay attention to that .
When you look at physics physics , you wonder what happens when we press something different .
And it doesn &apos;t get involved .
So how can we do that ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to say , &quot; What is going to happen when you &apos;re thinking about it ? &quot;
Look at it .
Well , we remember that the vocal divide of the universe would indicate the Universe from the universe .
They affect the dark matter , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing at the end of the sky , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing in the right .
Co@@ li@@ cable is a garage — it &apos;s a bed of gas , and you can see a lot of your head .
And what &apos;s happening here is that this is a passage of a study by a very good age .
And that &apos;s very important , because what that means is that very , very , very , very , very , very hard , very hard to put in the lab , can be able to eat and eat something that we can see .
Well , it &apos;s really fun .
It &apos;s about understanding why the basic idea of thinking about what makes us think about what makes us about what makes sense to us , which is why our vocal selves can teach us about the physics of physics , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re seeing as a lot of great things .
A fourth thing is physics .
It &apos;s actually going to look like this .
When and it &apos;s true , it has to be able to be dark energy .
When I get a balloon , I &apos;ll wait for the wind .
But I don &apos;t forget that he &apos;s going to be able to do a lot of money and more weight .
So , the same way that the universe looks like the deepest world .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s caused by its own weight .
They &apos;ll give it a little bit of an Iranian release and call it dark energy .
Again , we want to understand more about it .
Now , what is it saying that the question is , &quot; &quot; Oh , what is dark energy I can do in the universe ? &quot; &quot; which dark energy is going on to the universe ?
It &apos;s dependent on its shoulder , and that structure can provide itself as much as a mother of a day .
And the problem with the universe is the biggest scale of the mountain of complex sleep .
Look at the software .
We need no way .
I think it &apos;s about to think about it , and I think by sharing it .
Now , as a reference point , like the type of specialist , the most important thing , is not a model of a piece of food in a little bit of a piece called a piece of slavery , which is a good thing .
A more important thing is to look at the people who are more people .
So I can learn to learn a lot about the universe at the biggest scale of the universe , and these parts of the universe are the ones that have nodes in your head .
I finish my talk , and I finish my talk , but you can experience it .
Well , what I &apos;ve done with what I &apos;ve done with how best useful I think is that we have a few of them , but how do we really use it ?
Well , for example , I want to run Henry Ford , when he asked about the car .
This is what he said , &quot; &quot; If I tried to people what they needed , they would say that they need better and they have a very big deal with it .
And it &apos;s not clear that it &apos;s not clear .
They &apos;re not faster .
They require incredible numbers of scientific discovery .
So we need to get a lot of people out there , so we need to remember what &apos;s going on , but we also need to remember the insights that have been invention , the inspiring , the inspiring thing — this kind of thing jumping together as we go back , when we look back from the left side .
And in my way , the better way to do this is to learn from the universe . Thank you .
( Applause )
So , imagine that you &apos;re in the street in America , and you &apos;re going to come up to a dot and say , &quot; Excuse me , how do you call this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . Well , this is O@@ kin@@ k , but it &apos;s Ell@@ en .
It &apos;s about shock to shock , and that &apos;s what we do . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Well , good . How do you name this block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s no name in blogs .
The Vol@@ ans have a name ; blogs are just a little nameless , and &quot; &quot; He passes , &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s going , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s a little counterintuitive .
This is true , and now imagine yourself in the audience , you know , there &apos;s a lot of people in the audience , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; Excuse me , what do you call this guy ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is a block of 17 , and this is the top of the 16 . &quot; &quot; And you said , &quot; &quot; Well , good , but what do you call this guy ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; they say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , the guy has heard .
There &apos;s a name .
Look at Google Maps . This is 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
There &apos;s a name . There &apos;s a name . Vol@@ ta — this is a little nameless .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , good , but how do you know your house ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is just an eight-@@ year old lady .
There &apos;s a block of 17 , home one , and you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; F@@ uck . &quot; &quot; But he was like , &quot; &quot; Fa@@ il@@ ure . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , ladies . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Look , there &apos;s no way I &apos;m here . &quot; &quot; The United States says , &quot; &quot; Look , there &apos;s a lot of people who have been built . &quot; &quot; And then they &apos;re built .
The home that was built to the first day , is the home number one .
The home that was built to be matched by a number two .
We need a house — this is a number three , and it &apos;s simple . This is clear , I think , that sometimes we need to write to the other side of the ground to understand something that we don &apos;t even have to be , and to understand that the way that we don &apos;t even have to understand , and to understand that we don &apos;t even have to understand that we don &apos;t have to understand it .
This is , for example , in China , there are doctors that have to weigh that their health .
So every month , every month , if you don &apos;t have a heart attack , you don &apos;t have to pay for them , because they don &apos;t have to pay off their own work , because they don &apos;t have a lot of them .
( Applause ) Now , every musical &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; is a longer factor , the beginning of musical language , one , two three .
But in the West , there &apos;s a lot of people , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the end of the day , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the end of the rock .
Now , you can hear it not only in the way that you think about it , but as you think about it , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s kind of like you , you know .
And this is the exact opposite .
( Laughter ) Now , because in every true situation that talk about India , there &apos;s a lot of people who say it is true .
So , let &apos;s not forget that , if you &apos;re in TED , or not , it &apos;s not going to forget that you have a good idea , but it can also be true .
This is the cre@@ pt of the Car@@ tes@@ ian .
