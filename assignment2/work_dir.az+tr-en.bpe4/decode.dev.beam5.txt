I was 11 years old . In one of the United States , I &apos;m standing in the middle of our house .
The BBC was listening to the BBC of the BBC .
I had no idea that we had never been used , because the news coverage of news news news is that they have a number of people .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban came back . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; The Taliban came back .
I didn &apos;t realize what that meant , but I could see how my father was happy .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the moment , &quot; &quot; he said .
I could never forget .
You go to school .
I was six years old , and I was six years old , because I had six years old .
So for the next five years , I had to wear a song like a boy in the last five years , and I had to wear a song like a boy .
And that was the only way we could achieve education .
Every day , we have a different way of who we go .
We just bent our books out of the bags and tell you that we &apos;re not going to get used .
It was a home in a household , in a small hotel , in a small hotel .
It was a day , but it would be like crazy .
My mother , parents , and parents , we could preserve our lives .
Sometimes , for a week , the Taliban were connected to a week .
So what we &apos;ve experienced in the right time when we were able to see what we did .
What , right ?
Did we know that we live .
We were able to see , but yet , the school we wanted to be .
And I was really lucky , and I grew up in a family with a child , and I grew up in a family .
My father was a human being in his lifetime .
In fact , a different kind of patient who lived in a place in a place called &quot; &quot; The Lord , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; Oh , my mother , my mother , my mother , she would go to school .
But my mother went to school .
Ooh .
Two years ago , he went to school , and she turned our home to a school for girls and women .
And that &apos;s true — this is the first priority to education .
They didn &apos;t go back to school , and they didn &apos;t have any time to teach her parents to take risks .
To her , his children had to take education .
And in their lives , I would like to go out and see a light , and in the early days of our life , I would be able to see a light from that .
I &apos;m not going to tell me about my life . &quot; &quot; And it said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , my daughter , you could lose everything in life .
You can &apos;t take care of it . You can go back to the war .
But the only thing that &apos;s going to happen is that the only thing that &apos;s going to benefit us is that if we need to sell to the front of the sky , you have to sell you to school .
Now , if you don &apos;t continue to continue on it still ? &quot; &quot; This is 22 years old .
I grew up in a country with decades of war .
I could end up with less than six percent of my neighborhood , and if I was able to finish education , I didn &apos;t do that , and I wouldn &apos;t do that .
In fact , I think , here , here , I think , as I &apos;m here , I think that I &apos;m going to be in your darkness .
( Applause ) And in fact , in fact , when I came back to Afghanistan , one of the reasons why , in fact , it was my father who had been told to go to school .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m the first woman , but I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m the first woman walking around with cars .
( Applause ) So my father believes me .
I have a lot of people , and my family , for me , is much bigger .
And so , in fact , I &apos;m a teaching of women who I &apos;m going to have to teach women about 10 to 10 women .
And what we see is that women in a country have been risky in a country where women are risky in a country , in a country where , in fact , the first floor in New York .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m seeing in the middle of school when I &apos;m in school in school .
And when my parents came to me , my father would find out how many of their daughters had met their daughters as well as their daughters .
It &apos;s like crazy . I don &apos;t know what it means to tell you , but it &apos;s an ancestor of one of these students .
About a month ago , a month ago , with the rest of the time , with the rest of the road , it took them a few minutes to die in their way .
He played the phone in the garage , and the sound on the phone would go on to be able to go back to school , and on the phone would go back to school .
And then he said , &quot; &quot; If you want to die , kill me , kill me , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to preserve the future of my daughter , I &apos;m not going to preserve the future . &quot; &quot; And the thing that I &apos;ve discovered about , sometimes , is that all of us realize that every one of us has the value in the back of every one of us who &apos;s lost in the back of every single day — that &apos;s the fact that every
That doesn &apos;t mean that our memory is not opening up our fate .
In fact , their daughters are the most likely to believe that their daughters would believe that their daughters will believe in our bright future , but as in fact , in a society , the leaders of the men are the same .
When the Taliban went from school to school , the number of girls had hundreds of measurements of girls , as you know you know .
But now , in fact , in Afghanistan , girls are in three million years .
( Applause ) It looks very different when it comes from America from America .
I understand the fact that Americans are in change in change .
After all , I &apos;m afraid that I &apos;ve been afraid to take a lot of time after the U.S.
But when I came back to Afghanistan , when I came back to my parents , when I came back to my parents , I think that when I came back to my parents , I &apos;m going to take a moment to a future , a future , a future that I &apos;m going to make .
And so I think , in fact , the average country is the country , and the fact that there are some girls who are going to read it every single day .
They &apos;re also , like my me .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to go to watch the skin , and every single one of these cute guys , if you go down to the middle of two half hours , if you go down to the middle of two half hours , if you go down to the middle of two half hours , if you go down to the middle of two half hours , if you go down to the middle of two half hours , if you go down to the middle of two half hours , if you go down to the middle of
And you can see here , you &apos;ll see the example of biomimicry , but in a world for art .
It &apos;s a kind of friendly ballet dancer .
And this is cute .
And my favorite is that this is recycled .
All right , in every dive , every dive .
This is known for the unknown world .
They &apos;re underwater geysers .
It &apos;s a place where it &apos;s going to be a place where it &apos;s going to go through the floor .
And in this number , the female sees that she &apos;s much more likely to see her .
So let &apos;s look at it again . Here &apos;s the network on the right , and the net is the right net .
I &apos;m a call back , and it &apos;s coming back to the second .
I love it . I love websites . This is an incredible synergy .
Watch them out of their tentacles . They &apos;re drinking them . It makes it look like seaweed .
It &apos;s in the background .
This is the trick that we learn from this motion , and we learn a lot about new things .
And an spray . Incredible ? Now , Roger herself was afraid .
And he says , &quot; &quot; Oh , hey , it &apos;s been the head , it was found .
And so the best thing is possible when it &apos;s possible .
It &apos;s blowing . We &apos;ll go back .
One . Two . Three .
In fact , who &apos;s the history of who you are , but the outer world is about the history of who you are about the outer world .
Everything changed until all .
When we saw the first public menu , when we saw the first public menu , when we saw the first press , the first public doesn &apos;t matter when we saw the first public arc .
And I didn &apos;t take care of anyone .
Now , I don &apos;t even know what I &apos;m going to do .
And so what &apos;s going on here is that you can see the sky from the sky .
Part of the front party is part of a religion .
So as a result of a laser , a portal from a superintendent in a van , like a fan .
I could put it back on my way .
And I &apos;m asking for questions for question .
Every single thing happened to me , if I had to tell you anything about anything , if you had to know about anything , it would always be if you had to know about anything .
I could ask questions .
A policeman worker on that unit one .
But many of you , most of them are by the Chinese police .
And I was lucky , I was very lucky , and I was lucky enough to say that I was so lucky .
They had a new language , and then they had to get the whole lives of all life .
We need to make a place in South Asia .
We were scared , but when we don &apos;t divide , we were scared , but after that , we were scared .
If I &apos;m not Korean , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t have a restaurant ?
I started making plans for saving them .
I went down to the front of the floor , and I went to the front of the exhibition .
My father is not going to deal in Arabic .
I &apos;m standing up and wondering , and before I think about thinking about it , I was standing up and wondering , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m standing up and wondering , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m standing up . &quot;
My father came out of the front row , and my father came out of the front row .
But soon after a short period of time , the Laosenmer share the share of Lagos .
And we came up with a lot of time , but my father would be a little bit short , but in the middle of South Africa .
I didn &apos;t ask anybody I never ever met .
I wanted to tell you , it paid for the prison .
So that &apos;s my lifelong experience .
They start out with less amounts of money or less money .
Now , I &apos;m sure that TED Talks don &apos;t appear in the middle of nowhere .
This is what we designed in 2009 in 2003 .
We set it up in a circle .
It &apos;s going to take place on it .
You know , if you don &apos;t tell you , kids don &apos;t like brush .
It looks like this .
What do we do ?
The anchor director said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to have milk .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; This is not possible . &quot; &quot; But he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do if you put the lens from your village ?
The kids are falling apart , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t .
So we &apos;ve also moved around the trees .
There are three legs in the desert .
They &apos;ve allowed these grandchildren to call them fast .
But it &apos;s been used to other purpose .
They &apos;re separated from the sediment .
The kids are stuck .
( Laughter ) Sometimes sometimes it takes to 40 to four children .
This boy is so much like this boy that you can see .
( Laughter ) Every time a year , they sit in the village .
And it looks pretty much like this .
They &apos;re similar to the fruit module .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time .
( Laughter ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve made it possible to make it possible , because we &apos;re going to see the kids not only under our hands .
And so I can see the ceiling that &apos;s very high .
This is where it is — there &apos;s always water .
You see , the agile pipes are going to sink into their friends , and it &apos;s always normal . It &apos;s okay .
But what you see is that the gentleman you have to take care of .
( Laughter ) And when it comes to the snow , it &apos;s a total open volume .
There &apos;s nothing left out in the desert .
And that means that in the background , it &apos;s about diving into the background .
There are no visitors .
We don &apos;t rely on quarks .
Most of the kids have begun to get rid of all these kids .
But it doesn &apos;t have any implications .
Because there &apos;s no limitations here .
He says , if the boy standing in the corner , he would say to be in the room .
Relationships are going to go back and go back .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m crazy .
And then they go back and back .
This is natural .
Secondly , we think that we are very important that we are very important .
You know , kids have always invested much better .
They don &apos;t sleep .
We have kids in the classroom , and they &apos;re able to spend a lot of time in the classroom .
And you know , our surprise is that all of us grow up .
We need them .
You can &apos;t even talk about your friends with your friends .
You &apos;re not supposed to be .
And you know , in the present time , we &apos;re trying to apply everything .
And Buddhism is OK .
And so , on the end , we &apos;re able to see that when we &apos;re going to watch out 20 degrees above 20 degrees above , you can see that when you &apos;re on the end , you can see that when you &apos;re on top 20 degrees , you can see that in the end , you can see that in the end , you can see that .
We &apos;re going to sink into disgust .
We &apos;re just from 50 degrees above .
We have no water .
We don &apos;t even see it .
So we &apos;ve had since we &apos;ve been in trouble .
We &apos;ve got to be able to do with kids .
And they &apos;re trying to split the synesthesia .
They &apos;re actually helping .
But they don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) This is a child in the middle .
This is a black box .
This is the case .
Here &apos;s a good talk here .
There &apos;s also a lot of siblings .
And it &apos;s trying to hold the fruit on the bottom line .
( Laughter ) More than more . ( Laughter )
In every single speaker , there &apos;s a whole bunch of rows .
And there comes from Santa Cruz .
And this is another thing that happens , it &apos;s built on the surface of the ark .
It &apos;s five yards away , and it &apos;s seven years old .
Tavan is too high .
We need to give you an idea of danger .
We give a girl to a son .
They work inside .
It &apos;s bad .
Now , it &apos;s a mess .
It &apos;s very powerful . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) Here it is , that &apos;s how much danger you get from the tree .
And then we had to drink other kids .
You know , Toxo has a lot .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s trying to learn how to drive .
And if you &apos;re a kid , you need a luxury .
They &apos;re learning how to invest in each other .
This is a society , and we give that kind of opportunity .
This is a quote from 10 to 10 to 10 to 30 to 30 to 30 .
The connections are 183 .
Not really small .
Now , this little boy , I had to go into the sky .
But it &apos;s still a mess .
These are kids in the middle of the morning , and kids are moving around .
The kids who are in the middle of the nose are not going to give us the highest athletes .
Relationity always says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t pay attention to them .
We &apos;re left on the line . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They &apos;re going to open up . ( Laughter )
I think that I don &apos;t need to preserve them , and they don &apos;t really need to preserve them from the military .
It &apos;s got to be an oasis .
Because that &apos;s how they live alive .
And I think that the world is going to change the world of people and people .
And this building is one of those who is called to change their lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the 1970s , I &apos;ve been doing two years across the city in the 1970s .
And in the first grade grade , I got a lot of dragonflies in the middle of all the patients to go to school .
But my mother said , &quot; &quot; Younx . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not engineers .
And after that , I was one of the only way that we &apos;re going to get a good job , and that &apos;s the only way that you don &apos;t get good .
I don &apos;t want to love my work .
But my desire to be a Chinese opera .
In this way , I &apos;m trying to play my dream .
To become an opera , we need to be able to do with a young age of old age , and I did the future to find the future in the opera .
And in fact , I wrote a letter from our school to prepare for him .
But they didn &apos;t get my mind .
Nobody believed . Nobody believed .
But my friends would have been involved in my friends , and my friends would be married .
So I realized that I had to get 15 years old .
My arm was never a reality .
I &apos;m just afraid that I had to be a single chance to have a second word for the end of my life .
But that was justice .
I decided to find another way .
There &apos;s no way that there &apos;s no action . There &apos;s no action .
I did my books .
And I &apos;ve done this with my music that I was told to call a &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues &quot; &quot; written by music . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; Close Lei . &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The Lu Lei . &quot; &quot; &#93; I took care of this book on the road , and I &apos;ve been studying this book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; in the United States . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues &quot; &quot; written in the U.S.
Of course , in the middle of the country , there are the books in the middle .
It &apos;s true of the &quot; &quot; Jurassic Depot &quot; &quot; in the United States .
It doesn &apos;t have any use to do . I can see .
The Bible is very strange .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the other day .
But the fifth elixir brought me into my enlightenment . &quot; &quot; And in the end , you &apos;re going to be saying , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to make sense .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Haters , &quot; &quot; and so forth .
To give me my new civilization , let me tell me about my new civilization .
This can tell you a lot .
For example , this map seemed strange to me , because in China , we &apos;ve been able to study this map .
I didn &apos;t ask me to think about the fact that China is in the middle of the world .
Actually , map shows the map of the map .
It &apos;s not new .
This is standard in the science world .
And in fact , there &apos;s a lot of science in science and literature .
The subject is helping to be fully understood .
And so I thought , well , I &apos;ve been thinking , why don &apos;t you work in everyday life ?
So , I began to read books in their books .
Now , the same thing that happened in the same time when people participate in the same event , &#91; Benjamin Franklin &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; written : &quot; &quot; John Adams Adams .
&#91; &quot; &quot; This is the &quot; &quot; printer : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wizard of Oz : Warren Buffett and Life . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; This is a story . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Girl 1 : This is a story . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Girl 1 : The King &apos;s &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot;
For the stories of Jesus Christ , these were political and political .
Now , it &apos;s important for Buddhism , which is kind of a biology : the virtues , the fear and the social .
If you could have an Xian language , you &apos;re also interested in two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Cang THE &quot; &quot; written by &quot; &quot; Cang THE &quot; &quot; : Thomas Merton : &#91; &quot; &quot; Taio : The waterfire . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Taio : &quot; &quot; I made a lot of interesting elements of mine .
For example , I &apos;ve been able to understand the translation of the biologists in Latin America , which means &quot; &quot; gratification . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , in Latin America .
In Arabic , the word &quot; &quot; new . &quot; &quot; Yes !
( Laughter ) The books of the books that are going to allow people to communicate with people on time and present people .
I don &apos;t know if I could never be able to have any more or more power .
The reality of your intelligence is that the other people can &apos;t talk about the challenges of other people .
I started to believe that the hope is the only purpose of desire .
The main purpose of the stability is that we don &apos;t want to connect with each other .
The desire to do that is to do that .
It &apos;s because I &apos;m here today , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here , I &apos;m here and love . &quot; &quot; And so I &apos;ve been living with a very good purpose .
And I tell you , &quot; &quot; Have you always been with you ! &quot; &quot; I say .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in the office , and one of the most lucky ones is that if you &apos;re in the middle of your room , you &apos;re going to have your mortgage .
It just takes it .
It doesn &apos;t give any information about it .
Today to work today .
Have you ever missed that .
And then you &apos;d go back to his own hotel , and you said , &quot; &quot; Why am I my fault ? &quot; &quot; Okay , now you &apos;re in the middle of the morning , and you &apos;re in offices .
( Laughter ) And this is one of the women who came back to you .
And if I could go back and say , &quot; I know if I could take that two hours back , like , &quot; &quot; I want to get back to that two hours as well . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , every day of our employees will allow us to preserve them .
And I &apos;m talking about something more valuable than my office .
From the clock , from your time .
In fact , I believe that this is what a new kind of disease is causing a new disease .
( Laughter ) Now , you don &apos;t think about it as the most important part of the story that you can think of .
It &apos;s an amazing reflex — beep , click , click , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So — ( Laughter ) — yeah ?
Every company has a failure to play .
And it &apos;s really clear that there &apos;s really no good .
But in the last few years , in the last couple of years , there &apos;s a number between a bottom-up and wide distributed technology .
We have to cry . ( Laughter ) And the reason why is that this guy doesn &apos;t have a good job , you don &apos;t have a good job , you don &apos;t think about it .
Actually , I &apos;ve got the same word that I had a global epidemic .
I &apos;m talking to you .
So a couple of years ago , I put a video on it , a video that you could be able to do in this video .
This is what we &apos;re doing about five minutes of real-time real-time video .
You can &apos;t manage to control the spinal cord .
They don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
And everyone left the way back in the city .
It &apos;s okay .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look forward .
( Video ) Today , our purpose is to agree that we need a very important problem .
So , as a group , who was being interviewed ?
Salmon , Jovita . I work today .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Jesus , thank you for Jesus .
And I would say , there &apos;s a lot of people who we want to draw on .
And as a group — ( Laughter ) Saima — ( Laughter ) Samit , who &apos;s been on ?
Have you ever looked like me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) What do you know ?
And yes , it comes to me .
In a few weeks , a few weeks later , a few weeks after decades , 40,000 people from a decade were looking at this video .
And three years later , this video takes place every month .
If it &apos;s a number of millions and a video company , it &apos;s controlled by networks .
Now , I &apos;ve always been able to find the art that we had to find online objects .
I was able to find the reality that I could think about useful and use .
I started a study with a five-year study , and I started with a five-year study where those students had been doing their failures .
The middle industry alone has seven 2.2.9 years old .
( Laughter )
When the age of age comes back .
They can &apos;t see when they can &apos;t see the human voice .
It &apos;s one of the simplest flute players .
Which is that , in fact , women don &apos;t have a fully connected culture .
The last expedition was the last expedition of the United States of America .
The human mind is a human being understood .
And then they had the idea that they had to make a sense of laughter , or whether they had to be a sponge .
This is the phrase &quot; &quot; eureka , &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues &quot; &quot; in the book .
Before the boat , before and then , we &apos;ve got the boat .
This is a theory of science fiction , and it &apos;s a way that people can help make their sense better .
It can be set up .
( Laughter )
I &apos;d like to tell you a lot better about human beings .
If you don &apos;t have a lot of calories , you don &apos;t want to find out that you don &apos;t have a lot of calories in the bathroom or a few years old , and you didn &apos;t want to eat a thousand pounds .
I &apos;m my Maykmon Strip . I &apos;m sure that all sorts of things , you know ?
We &apos;ve been thinking about these kinds of paranoia that we &apos;re looking for , like , we &apos;ve been looking at all sorts of things , and we &apos;ve been thinking about the kinds of literature that we &apos;re talking about , the science , the scientific science , the scientific science , the lack of mental science , a lack of schizophrenia .
In the last time , if you &apos;re living in the last time , you &apos;ll get back to something like this .
Some of us would call us a chimpanzee .
But let me tell you , there &apos;s lots of things .
The police of the police , we &apos;ve got rid of them , we find them out . ( Laughter ) We want to change the plans . ( Laughter ) We want to change plans .
I show you a example of bad ideas .
I brought it back to me . It tells us that NBC .
This is a &quot; &quot; Quarro &quot; &quot; company &quot; &quot; The Quarro &quot; &quot; company .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Quaro 2,000 waitress . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; eureka . &quot; &quot; .
( Laughter ) And they had to put it on 900 dollars in school .
This is a plastic thing which is a plastic thing installed .
It can be used to be able to do a lot of information , but it &apos;s only for us to go to the marshmallow .
( Laughter ) So , if it works like this , if it &apos;s when it comes to the floor , if you go back to the floor , you &apos;ll open your head .
This is something .
I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) Hum . This is a little bit of to go back .
We &apos;ve got a lot of tests for this .
It will go on the side .
( Laughter ) You could get rid of you .
Now , the question is , is that the question is : Do you want to get the marshmallow ?
And this is what I &apos;m saying is , if you &apos;re hungry , you could be able to make it if you &apos;re hungry .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We don &apos;t just find our tapir , but we don &apos;t find our tapir .
Now , here &apos;s the next slide that I &apos;m going to show you , which is , this is exactly what &apos;s happening : the Extra , and they &apos;re always using it .
People remember what they found , they can &apos;t find them .
We &apos;ve been making everything that we &apos;ve been doing , and we don &apos;t make any sense of what we &apos;re doing .
Here we did .
We took two birds , put it in one of the squares of my photo , and we open it up .
And the exam to test for 50 percent was a success . ( Laughter ) And we get this result .
This is an interesting example of what we did .
This is a publication in three months . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s been broadcast in three months .
This is the future of the future .
How do people get out of it ?
So I &apos;ve got a very specific idea . This is what I &apos;ve been thinking about , as humans , when people get out of age .
Every decade in every decade would increase three numbers .
It &apos;s very interesting .
Don &apos;t think about science as a scientific material .
My hands and religion ?
This is what you think of with your hand .
These are two different things .
It &apos;s not that you don &apos;t agree .
It seems to think about the things .
For all the phenomena for all kinds of phenomena .
What is it that &apos;s more reality ? The world has become further away from the surface of the world , from other galaxies , from other galaxies , from other galaxies , in the palm of the canopy .
If you could read it , one of the people reading &quot; &quot; Shut &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; Photoshop &quot; &quot; ?
The main question in the public is that it &apos;s much more likely to make sense .
We need to know that if we don &apos;t call it the other world , we need to make sure that we don &apos;t know .
Homs more ? What do you care about if you have planets to help us have planets ? &quot; &quot; If the World Wide Web , the World Wide Web has made that ?
( Laughter ) Now , things like this kind of thing happened in the cartoon of Sydney .
And I read for moments : &quot; &quot; Next is a wonderful thing .
And I think you don &apos;t have the second batteries , and you don &apos;t do better . &quot; &quot; This slide is all clever design .
That &apos;s what this cartoon is .
( Applause ) You can say , &quot; &quot; You can tell you , &quot; &quot; You can say , &quot; &quot; You can tell you that it doesn &apos;t explain anything .
It doesn &apos;t happen .
This is the result of the creation of a man &apos;s creation for creation .
Now , scientists don &apos;t always tell us , sometimes they &apos;re kind of like dark matter , they call the dark matter , which is what we call the dark matter .
This is the beginning of the story for science .
Now , this is what I called &quot; &quot; The Cancer Map , &quot; &quot; and this is the last rings .
The same question is the same question , which is more reality ?
UFOFO- , no matter , no matter what &apos;s going on ?
This is a picture taken from my hometown , which is the U.K. from my home , from my home .
Buick Cick : It &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , it &apos;s kind of like the door .
Have nothing to do with Photoshop .
This is the image of &quot; &quot; Kodak . &quot; &quot; I photographed this pattern .
And if he had to go back and get ready .
And the camera was ready .
( Laughter ) Most of them can think about it , or even some of them , or some of them , but they &apos;re not all possible .
If we take more and more sophisticated , we &apos;ve always been looking at the statistical and theory of theory .
For example , there are two problems in the middle of the galaxy , and there were two problems .
The first one was not a theory about the beach .
Secondly , if we were able to hold the observations and looked at it , and so forth , it didn &apos;t really matter .
And he wrote this kind of thing : &quot; I &apos;ve seen that I had three bodies from three bodies . &quot;
That &apos;s what we saw .
So , without some of the good plazas , you can &apos;t see a good theory with the invisible theory of the theory .
This was like the 16555555500-year age .
This is the story of a book that led the stories of the book to deal with the West to deal Saturn .
That &apos;s what I didn &apos;t want to do with these two things . There &apos;s a good theory about the solar system and the solar system , and so forth . And so , in fact , we understood that Earth has been making faster than the Earth &apos;s Saturn .
And so we could also see the details of the community .
This is the theory of theory .
The downside is that it can be full of science .
And one of the reasons why we don &apos;t believe that the ones we have to believe is that one of the reasons why we don &apos;t think about it is because I &apos;m touching some serious reason .
We are everywhere .
This is what we are .
In 1974 , in 1974 , in 1974 , in 1974 , it would like to be photographed by the other side of the Earth , and people thought that it was created .
It &apos;s been photographed in 2003 .
If you &apos;re left your eyes , you can make it .
And if you think about your eyes , you &apos;re going to be able to image the image that you can see .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know what you &apos;re supposed to look like , because we &apos;ve been able to recognize that we have evolved to recognize the discoveries .
They are important for us to recognize .
And obviously , they don &apos;t laugh . Every time you see all kinds of disgust .
Here you see the mirror here .
( Laughter ) If they were connected to the present , then they saw the gecko &apos;s Kermit .
So Baxter . Did you see what they did ?
Or if there were lobbyists .
The icons .
( Laughter ) In 1990 , I was in my Tennessee &apos; 30s .
He would take five dollars of people who would like to see the nun , who would like to see the nun &apos;s belly as well .
Here &apos;s the Bauton Guir and the waterfall , and on the bottom line , what was there ?
And it &apos;s quite a lot of work , because it &apos;s very uncomfortable to work , because there &apos;s plenty of fish , and as you see these images , people have drawn pictures .
This is my village in Sao Paulo .
Here I am here in the middle of my niece , and I was able to see that in the wake of this room , I was able to touch it in a room .
( Laughter ) Woman : This is a $ 28 500 bucks to get $ 28 . ( Laughter )
How do you feel like somebody else ? ( Laughter )
Doms , in fact , is the equivalent of the so-called &quot; &quot; Paradise . &quot; &quot; And in fact , the hotel .
I &apos;m trying to find Cleveland Florida .
To see this , I &apos;ve been able to see that .
There are many people .
It &apos;s a lot of faith in the cars that are coming out of cars .
We &apos;ve got more interested .
So , this is what you can do — this is , and I &apos;ve talked about it on the surface of the image , two , two , two , two half years old .
People in the sense of respect for people .
We went and looked up to the rest and see what happened .
It &apos;s a picture that &apos;s going on in the places where it comes from funding and money to fund .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to see here on the other side of the other side .
All right , in a building , most of the most primitive .
( Laughter ) This is really what I &apos;m really saying , I &apos;m really sorry ?
I &apos;m going to finish with another example that I &apos;m going to finish with a different particle .
There &apos;s a film called &quot; &quot; The Web , &quot; &quot; which is a movie , talking about the dead .
When I came back , they don &apos;t talk about dying in the dead .
It turns out that everybody knows .
That &apos;s the answer to the dead .
( Laughter ) In this movie , it &apos;s hidden in the electronics of electronics .
I uploaded them from one letter to a quote called &quot; &quot; The Restema . &quot; &quot;
This is the highest motivator .
This is the sound of that celebrity .
( Applause ) If there are other ways , if there are other ways , you have to be worried .
Now , Cyril is our summer .
It will be the way that we have two ways to change .
All the day to listen .
Now , let &apos;s go back . You can see here in the dictionary ?
( Music and analogies ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends )
( Music and counterintuitive words ) What are you equal ? All right ?
What is the stuff ? You don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you about what you need to do in terms of what your brain is to do .
( Music ) It &apos;s possible when you see what it is . ( Music )
I &apos;m going to finish with a small , fresh story .
This is an era of commercial commercial .
We &apos;re trying to make people do better .
There &apos;s also a pop tribe .
And here is a number of masters : It &apos;s called Katie Meadow .
There &apos;s a lot .
In 2009 , in 2009 , it was between the best five rupees . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Sleep . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the story of love — the British story — the British story , is the same as a man like Nash .
There &apos;s a feeling like this .
( Music ) ( Music ) We are about 12 billion light bulbs , and that &apos;s a laugh . No , I can tell you that that &apos;s true . But I can tell you , I &apos;m going to be a lifetime .
Announcer : Great . It &apos;s at least number .
In America , it would be like , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to go away from the darkness of six to six . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , my friend Simon Kich , who &apos;s a great deal of physics , is the teacher &apos;s book , &quot; &quot; The Great Wall . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the teacher &apos;s book , and it &apos;s a teacher in order to make sure .
And so , &quot; &quot; The Guardian &apos;s &quot; &quot; is written about the heat from the &quot; &quot; The Guardian . &quot; &quot; And it turns out that there &apos;s no matter how far away we are .
Not 12 , 123 billion light bulbs , and that &apos;s not a laugh .
Now , even though it &apos;s hard to make a little bit , we know what it is to do .
So we can tell you , if it isn &apos;t right , it &apos;s very intimate .
The whole thing is , after the day , the Katie of Katie , the Katie of Katie , which was a lot of shame .
I was able to put it in .
And I &apos;ll end with that .
( Music ) And we &apos;re on the front lines of the universe where we &apos;re going to see the rest of the universe that we &apos;re able to see .
It can be a dream , but this is the closest number of numbers .
And so , in our future , I &apos;ve always been able to do this , and I &apos;m always going to make it happen .
( Laughter ) Okay ?
( Applause )
In the 1980s , in the 1980s , in the 1980s , in the 1980s , you have to put it out of bed .
It has to pass a call in the machine .
And it would be the opposite of all the publishers .
In a piece of paper , you could find a piece of paper in a piece of paper .
And we &apos;ve been thinking about it as a kind of chaotic thing that we would like to be in women .
We &apos;ve never been able to invent this in our own country .
But this day , in 2009 , in 2009 , one of the great markers of brand one single single single brand is that if you &apos;re in the middle of every single speaker , you &apos;ll be able to make a picture of a single single piece of a piece , which is that you can only make a picture of the sound in which you want to take a laser .
This is the reality today .
Nobody else has this .
This is what we call the technology of our government .
This problem is one of three main intentions issues .
And if you &apos;re looking back to the problems , then we can see the genomes of a few years ago .
These are the characteristics of these cells .
First , the usual suspects .
This is like DDimitri Qagv , which is the Kooking city , which is known for the U.K.
And it &apos;s not hard to understand the reasons why those people don &apos;t cooperate .
These guys get money .
Many , many more , very much more likely to earn more money .
Well , it &apos;s actually a million people who have a million people who were multimillionaires .
This is the Tummir Toms from a city in the city .
This is the Alach Gonzols .
This is from Stephen Watt .
This is the Bjan Sunn .
This is Matthew Anderson and the history of the Mall .
These guys are going to take care of their condoms , but they don &apos;t use it in ways that we have to use it in the process to spend money in the process , and then they use a computer to make money to spend money on a chip in order to spend money on a chip .
Two months ago , in this picture of the U.S. , the United States has been in this picture called Sam Jlin &apos;s account in this picture , and he had 149 million Americans .
And nobody knows that Sam mathematicians don &apos;t know .
And I think we need to think about the fact that we need to be more than the real world in the Jewish world .
And it turns out that as long as we get older , it &apos;s more and less .
And in the future , in the future , the majority of Africans will lead to success .
The second largest group of people who have been able to do this is because they &apos;re not cash .
And the reason why we need to see them is that the reason why we need to see them is a chance .
And as Anonymous as Anonymous , the older people grow up and they &apos;ve been able to keep track of them .
And if I had the two main humanists : these people who don &apos;t have this work for money , like Anonymous — the third main thing that makes it work , is the government and the government .
Let &apos;s look at all kinds of things in terms of the company .
This is the obvious example of what happens when governments are going to attack their assets .
This is a new exhibition in the Hole in New York — in fact — it was like .
In the last year , we &apos;ve gone ahead of our decades .
And if he entered the system , the whole system went down .
And I asked the last week , &quot; &quot; I asked the Dutch , &quot; &quot; I asked that question , &quot; &quot; I asked that question , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I asked that question , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said
He said it .
What happens is that people would die in the end ?
The Direction is the exhibition .
It &apos;s a great list of documents .
What do they do with your product ?
If you have a moral imperative , you need to have this joint , and you want to use SSL password , if you want to use SSL password .
We use a lot of people to use emails and other types of memes , like this , which is more than the African governments in the country , as if they have a lot more likely to use these foreign fighters , because they don &apos;t have access to the government , because they don &apos;t have access to the government .
But this is the root of the organization that has been proposed by the foreign markets .
It &apos;s possible to spread out the Sabbath .
This was what was going on in the hotel company .
How many of the things are , what do you want ?
And in principle , 2011 , the U.S. Applied polymers were the center of the so-called &quot; &quot; The Vagina medal . &quot; &quot; And when they did it , they made a lot of research .
And there was a piece of paper that said , &quot; &quot; FIFOER . &quot; &quot; And in this case , Germany has had a series of workshops in the United States , and in this case , in the German World War II , all of the networks in the United States were able to put all the way back into the skin .
These tools were sold to 28,000 hunters in World War II .
The center of the company is right here .
In fact , the U.S. government empowers the government to provide their assets under the skin of the United States .
But the governments , the governments , the governments .
For example , a virus called &quot; &quot; The Germans , &quot; &quot; which was a virus called &quot; &quot; The Germans , &quot; &quot; which had been created by the German government , and they &apos;ve been trained by the German government .
Now , if you &apos;re delighted to be , you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not going to get all of you .
But now it &apos;s also increasing .
The Internet will travel .
You know , if you don &apos;t have the same way to do that , you can imagine that if you have all the bonds , you can imagine what your password is doing , and what your password is doing .
Many of the guys , when we talk about the issues , the number of people , the question , &quot; &quot; Hmm , it &apos;s not a good job , but I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good job .
Why am I worried ?
There &apos;s nothing hidden in secret . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s not very wrong .
Mystery is the opposite .
It &apos;s not bitter .
It &apos;s not optional , and it &apos;s not optional .
It depends on the choice between the ages and the language .
And that &apos;s why in 2009 , when we believe our government in this day , we have this tendency to believe in our own way .
But in the future , what happens in the future , in the future , in the next 50 years , the next government would be connected ?
And the question and questions like that , in the next 50 years , will have to worry about us .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
And I say , &quot; &quot; I thank you you are here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I thank you .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back to the University of Washington .
And my father and my friends had to listen to me to listen to me .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you &apos;re here , I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you &apos;re here .
( Laughter ) Imagine if you &apos;ve got 17 years old , and you can imagine the living behavior of your head .
It said to me , &quot; &quot; This is this movie . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing it .
I was looking in my way because I didn &apos;t understand the way my voice came from .
When I was 17 years old , I said , &quot; Oh my God , what do I think you &apos;re thinking about ? &quot;
And then I realized , I &apos;m glad that I &apos;m feeling myself .
It said , &quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s the &quot; &quot; right , &quot; &quot; they would say , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s the whole thing .
This is what we need to think about , but this is what we need to think about .
I want you to think about our journey and your own journey , and you think about your own journey .
My journey came from 1977 to 1977 , which is the moment when I witnessed two strains under the Goluth Gallery , then half a mile from the Golden Gate Bridge .
I decided to use it to be able to take me out of the financial supplies .
This is a huge thing for California .
This is something that I &apos;ve experienced in terms of what I &apos;ve experienced in terms of what I &apos;ve experienced in this country , in the 71th year , in the 71th year .
And I &apos;d like to walk around in the closet , and people — they didn &apos;t .
They said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re doing this , right ?
And I thought , &quot; &quot; If you do this , maybe you &apos;re doing it , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; Do you want to make it bad ? &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it .
Because , you know , everybody would ever follow .
And I would talk to people about this , and I was constantly engaged with people who are connected to them .
I said , &quot; &quot; I asked my phone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I asked
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use cars anymore . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t use the car anymore . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know why it was like this time .
They lived in Philadelphia in Philadelphia .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Everything I &apos;m saying is everything , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t have to say anything about it , I don &apos;t need to say anything .
So I decided in my journal my birth day , and so I decided to talk a lot about — I decided to talk a lot about it — I decided to talk about a daily basis .
So I did this .
I didn &apos;t talk about it in a way .
And that was a wonderful experience for me , because I began to listen to this for the first time .
And I had to think about what I was hearing .
Because I &apos;ve always been reminded of people , and I &apos;m listening to people , and when I listen to people , I don &apos;t listen to them about what I &apos;ve heard about , and I don &apos;t listen to them about what I heard about .
And when I was talking about my crying and people , when I was talking about my crying and people , when I talked about what I would like to think about .
And then ...
And it &apos;s hard to communicate .
And that day , I was listening to myself .
And this was my voice because I realized I didn &apos;t learn about something .
I had 27 years old , and I thought , I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , for the next day , I &apos;ve been looking at it , and then again , and again , I &apos;ve talked about this time , because I &apos;ve started to learn , because I &apos;ve started studying and I needed it , and I needed it .
So , I didn &apos;t talk about a year , and then I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about it .
But it took 17 years .
And I went on in the straws of 17 years old , and I went on in the basement , and I went on to learn to read and read and read .
And I thought , I need education .
In Italy , I went to Oregon , and there were software programs there .
800 miles per mile .
I went to the office office , and what ?
I showed up on the grave .
Ah , you want to read here ?
What do you want ?
We have a special program for you .
And after two years old , I went through the middle of two years .
He came up with me . He took me apart .
And he said , &quot; &quot; My son , I &apos;m my son , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do with you , but we don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do with you .
If you don &apos;t take a car , you don &apos;t drive , you don &apos;t take it to go , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I started to take care of myself .
I came to Washington Towira , Washington , D.C. I went from the tree to Washington , Washington , D.C. , and in the U.K.
Two years ago , I had embraced the University of Montana .
I wouldn &apos;t be bad for two years .
( Laughter ) And so it happened . I got trained in my school where I was trained in school .
There are two stories in Montana .
The first one is , when I came in , this was my grandfather .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m worried about this , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m worried about this , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In the morning , &quot; &quot; came to me 150 bucks , and said , &quot; &quot; Have you ever been in the morning .
You &apos;re going to go to America ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Did you get it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , there &apos;s days and lakes , you know ?
So I did this .
He came back to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Ooh , John , you can use the opening of the office to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , John , John , you can use a book to say , &quot; &quot; You can use a book to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , John , John .
And so let me remind you that all of our professionals don &apos;t participate in their class .
And if they don &apos;t have to deal with that , and if they don &apos;t want to worry about it , they would say , &quot; &quot; Great ! You know , you know , you know , you know ?
They were asking me to help me .
And they would see that my strength was very much , and they were trying to make a root .
And I would like to talk about it .
I had 13 students in the room , and I had 13 students .
And my friend in my friend , my friend of mine , my friend of mine , who was my name for John Francis Francis , who said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have any more translation — that &apos;s the last lesson .
The students are all the ones .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I would find a little bit about it .
But I had to tell them to them .
After two weeks , everyone would work in the classroom .
And so I learned a lot about this class .
People who want to tell John what &apos;s going to call John — I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know , I think it &apos;s the spread of the tree .
No , no , no , no . That &apos;s not that .
And if it was the best part , it was ...
You can do it .
You talk about that choice .
So , this is the debate .
I came back from that work and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m free .
But there was something that I learned about my learning , and when I show them a sign that I didn &apos;t hold any way , I would like to tell you that I didn &apos;t even know if I &apos;d like it .
And I thought , if I think about it , and if I think about it , and you don &apos;t learn to say , you don &apos;t have to tell you .
So I kept on .
My father came across a line , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , we make it out of my head , &quot; &quot; and then you could say , &quot; &quot; You know , we don &apos;t start talking with you .
What do you think about ? &quot; &quot; I went to the University of Wisconsin , and I went to the University of Wisconsin .
So I had a written article about what I had written about two years .
Nobody was interested in the words .
But something happened — ExExxon Valdez .
And I was a guy who wrote about these words in the U.S.
It came back .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how I understand how this works . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t tell you .
And my legs said , &quot; &quot; You need to leave the equation because you make the better work . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I got my sister again .
I &apos;d like to take my banjo , and I went around the Atlantic Ocean , and we had to go back to the Atlantic Ocean , and we had to go back to the Atlantic .
And in 1990 , I started to talk about the time in 2009 .
And so I &apos;ve worked with those people , because when they don &apos;t , they don &apos;t go to where they fall .
And I thank my parents , because they had to fight me .
And this is a communication .
And they taught me to listen to me .
And this is something that came from the celebration — to listen to each other .
I &apos;m really important — we need to listen to each other .
My journey on my journey .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is this movie &quot; &quot; and I didn &apos;t give it .
I &apos;ve worked on my blog , I &apos;ve been working on the verge of BMI .
For the U.S. , I &apos;ve written in the U.S.
Twenty years ago , if someone said to me , &quot; John , you want to know John ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I want to do it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the Middle East , go to the Middle East , go to the East Side , &quot; &quot; and then they said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then they said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You &apos;d like to understand , you want to understand .
What happens ? What is that ?
How do you know how to find things for things like the Piica ?
It &apos;s a great deal of civilization .
And after that — I said — I said — I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to see it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not going to see that job . &quot; &quot; And I went back to the village , until I went to Venice .
The important problem came from my mind — I want to tell you why I started talking to you .
I started talking to my talk , and I started talking about the magic .
And in this time , I had learned about the kind of wealth that I learned in the form of wealth .
And what I &apos;ve learned is that , according to the informal world — what we &apos;ve learned about humans , and what we &apos;re learning about .
And not just because the trees and the birds don &apos;t tell us about each other , but they didn &apos;t tell us about each other .
And if we don &apos;t , our rights , our sense of view ourselves , is that we are constantly looking around our environment and our behavior .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to conclude .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have to go back to the other village , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have to go back to the village , &quot; &quot; and I went back to my own , and I went back to my own , and I started walking around .
This is the result of the story of this story , and I didn &apos;t even get there .
And I went around and I went around and I had to go back to prison , and I knew what happened to me , because I didn &apos;t have any solutions because I didn &apos;t .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , my monks kept me back to me , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; In the basement , passport . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; In the basement , passport . &quot; &quot; And he pointed back to me .
And I said to him , &quot; &quot; Your dentist ?
I didn &apos;t have to put it on my shoulder , I &apos;m in my bag .
I went the GMT , and I went around the world , and I went around the world .
What did it do ?
The Road came along the way .
They didn &apos;t laugh .
What do I thank myself when I was lucky , and I &apos;m lucky ?
After 150 miles of roads , I came to realize that when I did not , I became a product , I became a product .
I was in prison , and I had to open it up .
I &apos;m not going to use the power of a traditional financial vehicle .
How is it ?
Because when I started to use the car now , it would be like if I started to use cars .
But the difference was that I &apos;ve always wanted my job , but I &apos;ve never always wanted my legs to use my feet .
I &apos;m going to have the GMT cry .
I &apos;m not a professor of crying .
And so I realized that I had another appeal to other stories , and I &apos;ve had to change it .
You know , we can do that .
I had to change .
I was afraid to change and changed because I &apos;ve always taught me to become a leader .
Because I had to go to prison to prison .
I didn &apos;t know who I am .
But I could know that it was necessary .
I could change , because I &apos;m not here today , because I &apos;m not here today .
And I know that we all want to get ourselves alive , but for us , we don &apos;t always get ourselves alive .
We need to go back to where we &apos;re going to have new identity that we have now , where we &apos;re going to have new identity .
And what I &apos;d like to go back to where I &apos;m going to go back to where you &apos;re going to go to where you &apos;re going to go to prison , where you can go from prison to where you can go from prison to where you can go to prison . That day , we &apos;re not doing anything .
We &apos;re now changing .
We need to be a winner for our President Joy .
And if my voice inspired to you , if my voice inspired to you , let me pretend I &apos;m here .
And I know that when I &apos;m here , you can actually make that .
And if you want to go to the world , we would like to think about this kind of thing , which is that we &apos;ve been able to talk about each other in this sense that we &apos;ve heard about each other at TED .
Because ours , our behavior is our behavior of our behavior .
So I &apos;d like to finish up on my breath , and I &apos;m standing here with five seconds .
Thank you . Thank you .

You know , in America , in America , in America , you get a little bit closer to what you &apos;re going to do , and ask the question , &quot; Who is it ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; This is the Oak cube , that &apos;s the Oak .
This is 26 , that &apos;s 26 . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s fine ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s fine ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Oh , what &apos;s this disc ?
They have the names of these panels , which are just like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of trouble . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of anger , and it &apos;s called .
Now , let &apos;s imagine if you could make it right now , and if you were to say , if you were to make it right now , you would say , &quot; Get out , what &apos;s this ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This block is 174 and the number of that block . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s wrong ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s wrong ?
They &apos;re names .
Google Mapmeter here . This is 14 , 15 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 17 .
All of these blocks have the names of these blocks . It &apos;s the equivalent of the triangles .
And you say , &quot; &quot; How do you do that ? &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you do your home ? That &apos;s simple .
This is the B17 and home 1 , and then , &quot; &quot; If you ask me , &quot; &quot; Have you ever asked me , &quot; &quot; Oh yeah . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t go on the road , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , they don &apos;t go to the housing .
The first one is the number of three people in the desert .
The number of twins , after that , is twice the size of the second .
This is a profit . It &apos;s the case , and it &apos;s the Enlightenment . &quot; &quot; Sometimes I love the most amazing thing that we haven &apos;t been able to understand when we don &apos;t think that we &apos;ve never seen any way to understand our lives .
For example , there &apos;s a lot of people who are the ones who are in the middle of it .
You don &apos;t pay attention to your parents , and if you don &apos;t get sick , you don &apos;t pay for any money , because they don &apos;t have any money , because they &apos;re safe when they &apos;re safe .
( Applause ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends ) And one , two , three , four four .
But the African African music shows a piece of music , as a result of a sentence after a sentence .
So , it &apos;s not just about taking it apart , but you can see it &apos;s two , three , four , four .
And that map is true .
But I &apos;m also saying that you can &apos;t see what you &apos;re hearing about India .
So , we don &apos;t forget to forget about any time , TEDically , or in other places , and if you don &apos;t know , it could be right .
