Today , I &apos;m going to call that my observation set up .
I &apos;m now working on the solar technology industry .
And when I started the tiny little dot , we put ourselves in the power of the air .
And so , for that , you can see the different mirrors .
This is just a little video about what we &apos;re doing .
Wait .
It &apos;s a little bit about it .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m not just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter ) — I &apos;m just — ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter )
( Music )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The sun is ...
Ah , just finished ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;ll see you . ( Laughter )
So I want you to take care of what you do .
And after a few minutes , we &apos;ll go back to this . I hope that if you have to learn from your body , it can make your life more valuable .
We are very interested in language , especially when we &apos;re interested in language .
The different ones are asking us : ( Laughter ) — if you &apos;re in the middle , or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or or whether or not .
Narrator : They &apos;re going to get 10 numbers .
This lucky police of the U.S.
And when it comes to me , it goes . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We live . We &apos;re saving ourselves .
We are stuck .
We &apos;re trying to make invisible things in our lives .
As you can see , there are moments and people do the same things .
And it turns out that this is the fact that the power of power and strength is happening .
And even if we don &apos;t think about it , we often tend to complete gestures .
So if we could make a sense of violence , we &apos;re trying to make sure that if we don &apos;t make it clear , we &apos;re trying to make it happen .
We &apos;re going to be in the power of it .
Have you ever imagined that ?
And I saw that MBA students have a lot of roads .
They &apos;re going to work as a leader leaders , as leaders , when they go into the lifestyle , they &apos;re not going to start in the middle of the room .
They &apos;re almost like two grandmothers .
They put their hands on their hands .
They get less and less .
They &apos;re hanging out as they sit and their hands .
For myself , I had a few minutes to myself .
The first one is to tell you that it will not be .
Now , it &apos;s been influenced by this .
So the women who are women are more likely to get men .
They &apos;re even more vulnerable than men who are older than men .
And it &apos;s also hanging out from the outside .
And these MBA students are very important , because they have their interest in interest rates .
We &apos;ve always been trying to deal with each other in their own way .
The people who are prepared for the actions and women are at the end of the age , and they &apos;re connected to a team .
I began to think about myself , so we keep thinking about myself .
If you want these videos , if you want them to take that kind of video , then they ask them to take care of them more activism ?
And so , you know , if we did a lot , it wouldn &apos;t be that if we did it .
So , if we give ourselves a long period of time , if we can make ourselves feel more powerful in your behavior ?
We know that jazz and memes make sense of what other people think about , and that &apos;s a lot .
But the question is , the question of why is that this is the kind of jury and memes that we &apos;re interested in .
But we also have to be able to smile in this way , and we need to smile .
That &apos;s what it takes every two right .
And the power of power .
And if we make ourselves feel powerful and confident that we are more likely to make ourselves feel powerful .
It doesn &apos;t change our minds to change our minds , not changing our minds , not changing our actions .
What do I talk about when you think about power ?
And I &apos;m talking about physics , and I &apos;m talking about the physics of physics , and I tell me that these hormones , and I study these hormones .
What is the most important difference ?
Not only is that , very strong people often have a very strong interest .
&quot; &quot; Please , &quot; &quot; and do you like to say , &quot; &quot; Please .
And we offer them to play a box .
They chose to play a chimpanzee with the risk of risk .
But it &apos;s also about 60 percent of the lack of power , and 60 percent .
This is a test for the test .
Now , when the data comes from the moment , I &apos;ve got 20 percent increase in recent experiments in the early days , and in other parts of the other hand , 10 percent of the time .
It happens to be a zero-sum reality .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Music ends ) ( Music ends )
It &apos;s only about 25 percent reduction in cortical illness in terms of corruption .
Now , two minutes now that we need to make these mustarmonal change , which our brains are more ambitious , and whether our brains are more ambitious , whether they &apos;re more ambitious and comfortable .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve met , right ?
We don &apos;t think about how we think about our language and how we think about our language , but not only for others .
We think other than that .
And the next question that we &apos;re interested in is the question that we have to take care of our lives that we need to take care of our lives .
It &apos;s a two-minute marshes in the lab .
How do you apply that in the world ?
Of course , that &apos;s what the main interest is .
And the idea is that these hormones can be used to invest in terms of social education .
Are we going to be asked , by the way ?
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like to go back .
Some of these schools are meetings .
Some of them go back and go into this way , or a business interview .
And we thought , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got a lot of work , you know , because there &apos;s lots of experiments .
So we &apos;ve been obsessed with our tapir , and they had a huge debate , and they said , &quot; &quot; How do we do that ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we did this idea in denial . No , no . We don &apos;t hold it on .
You don &apos;t do that .
This is not with you .
You can communicate with yourself .
What do you do before you start ?
You sit . You &apos;re looking at your skin and your Andromeda .
You &apos;re looking at your feet , you cut it out of you , you &apos;re collecting your hammer , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to do . It &apos;s just like sitting on the feet .
That was what we wanted to do .
The organizers went into the Atlantic , and after that , they went through an interview with a lot of women , and after that , they went to an interview interview .
It would take a video of five minutes old .
They &apos;ve never taught them to be able to take care of their interest in their interest because they don &apos;t want to use them .
In five minutes or five minutes , it &apos;s more tangible than that .
Nobody likes it .
The Marian Lahalce is called &quot; &quot; The Mar<unk> Laé . &quot; &quot; This is called &quot; &quot; The Hindu press . &quot; &quot; This is a disease .
We &apos;ve had a study that we &apos;ve experienced to see things .
And then we &apos;ve shown here all the four months of these things .
They &apos;re not prepared for us .
They &apos;ve been unable to know who they had to take , and then they said , &quot; &quot; We want to take it to work . &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; We want to take it to work .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to take it .
And then there &apos;s a little bit more common . &quot; &quot; And what does it work ?
That &apos;s not because they don &apos;t .
They depend on their lives .
So we looked at them on the other side of the show , and for example , what the chances are ?
What does it do ?
There was no fact that the skin had no faith .
That &apos;s what the most important impact .
People were lonely .
So they &apos;ve been able to make the self-esteem .
They had no effect whatsoever .
This is the result of that .
And when I say to people , we think about our minds , our behavior , our behavior , will change our behavior , and say , &quot; &quot; This is not just about keeping out ? &quot; &quot; And when I say , &quot; &quot; This is not just about keeping ?
And so I say , &quot; &quot; Look at the truth until the moment .
&quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t .
And I don &apos;t want to feel like I &apos;m going to make it happen .
I don &apos;t want to be a taker .
I don &apos;t want to be there .
I want these words to do so well . &quot; &quot; I want to tell you a little story about the sense that I don &apos;t go back and say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t sit there .
When I was 19 years old , I had a very heavy car .
It was in the desert .
I became a few times .
And I had to go back and see if I had to go , and I had to leave the column , and I had to leave the column , and I &apos;d say , well , I &apos;ve got a lot of headache .
I was known as a woman , because I was known as a kid , and I was known as a kid .
For me , I tried to go back and get back .
They said to me , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t finish the college .
It &apos;s a lot of things that you might be able to do , but I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to fight it . I &apos;m trying to fight the challenge of what you &apos;re having to do with your hand , to tell me nothing about what you &apos;re doing .
I was very weak .
I was working , working on my own , I tried to work on my own , and I had to take care of myself .
And I ended up on the floor .
I &apos;ve had a couple of years of roads , and I had to take the front row , and the Susan Fischini , the Susan Fisvore University , I went to the University of Finance who said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have anything .
I was sad .
In the &apos; 40s , 20 grandmothers in the &apos; 40s .
It was just that .
I was so afraid that in the morning , I was so afraid that I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re going to go .
And if you &apos;re going to go and say , I &apos;m going to ask you .
And even though it is .
You &apos;re going to make all the things you need .
Now , again , when you &apos;re scared and you &apos;re afraid , you &apos;re afraid that if you don &apos;t listen to you , it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Art is taken .
Have you ever come from my journey . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve done it .
I slept in a thousand years , and I slept in a couple of years , and a couple of years , I &apos;m working on my blog , I &apos;m working on my blog , I &apos;m working on it .
And at the end of the first year , at the end of the first year , when I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to participate in your class , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t go to school , you &apos;re going to die . &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t go to school , you will die .
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not my place , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; This is not my village . &quot;
This is my return to me .
Because two things lead .
The first one I realized is that I don &apos;t have any sense .
But he felt that feeling and that feeling .
And second , I didn &apos;t understand that it was right .
So , he could make it work .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Nir , you &apos;re right ?
It will show you that it &apos;s going to show you that in the morning , it will show you that it will be very powerful , and you &apos;re going to give you the best reason why we &apos;ve been talking about it today . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , a couple of months later , that &apos;s what happened to me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A few months later , he came up with me , and I had to tell you how much more than that . ( Laughter )
It was changed .
And so I &apos;d like to tell you .
Think about it until the reality of the reality .
That &apos;s how much you want to do .
You know , you know , I &apos;m sorry , you know , you know ?
They can make that huge change .
And now , I say , two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
The next time you &apos;re going to get a chance to invest once a year ago , you &apos;re going to try to do it in two words , in the cockroach , in the cockroach , in the belly , in the belly of the table .
Raise your way .
That &apos;s the best way you can take your brain .
increase your connectome . You reduce your dignity .
&quot; &quot; Romors , I couldn &apos;t show them that I &apos;m not going to show them what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t leave it with the rest of it .
You can see who I was saying , &quot; &quot; I could tell them who I was . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ll pass it .
And I want you to start with those halls , and I want you to share it with other people , because that &apos;s a lot .
This is not a chance to disagree . ( Laughter ) This is not a chance of communicating and share with people , because people who can benefit from that are people who don &apos;t have access to technology and access to technology .
You share it with them , you can use it .
Because it &apos;s not really important for them to take care of each other &apos;s lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have very strong mobility in the world .
It &apos;s the closest example of all their faces .
It &apos;s like the goats that are going to happen to live in order to survive .
Along from the conflict , they had a lot of disagreements from the clash of apartheid .
They &apos;re being engaged in a business for all of all sorts of things , and they &apos;re very honest , and they don &apos;t think they &apos;re not really persuasive .
Here , in Sierra Leone , the 90 percent of the products have to take over 90 percent .
Most of them work , and many of the things that we have done is that they &apos;ve donated their periods .
It &apos;s about a couple of different squares in the snow , and they &apos;re also reminded of cars , and they &apos;re also reminded of the size of the literature .
And that &apos;s why I had to meet with the characters of the deceased .
I &apos;m an artist , and I want to be an artist . I &apos;m going to ask me to be a question of whether I &apos;m social , social and moral .
In 2009 , I converted my job into magazines of my life in 2003 .
But I &apos;ve also been able to support these times .
My job was to take a lot more attention than my job , and my job was to take care of these dunes , and they helped them to take care of their self-esteem .
This day , these days , in the middle of the United States , they &apos;re in social media .
And it &apos;s a question that I &apos;ve always worked with this world since I &apos;ve known about this world .
Many of the most in the city , I got a lot in my hometown of metal , and I had a lot of visitors around the world .
And I came across the 19th , not only BERT , but they weren &apos;t just BERT .
I had to go back to them in relation to them , in Africa , in South Africa , even in the country , and in the developing country .
I understood that this is more than more people , because it &apos;s huge .
And after that , I created a movement underneath which I created &quot; &quot; The Character eye . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then I created a movement that has been able to do with our hands .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , the &quot; &quot; Karroars &quot; &quot; is a tremendous movement that was created by the invention of the &quot; &quot; Karroars . &quot; &quot; It was a tremendous movement that was created by the way that we were created .
They &apos;ve had friends , stomatars , lions , hairs , hairs , hairs , hairs , etc .
In fact , when we &apos;re not married by our volunteers volunteers , they would give them a lot of people to see that liberals and women are going to give them a lot to see the unattainable of the water .
They had another promise for lack of dignity , and they don &apos;t laugh .
And finally , they &apos;ve got a lot of great and larger than that .
In Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo , Sao Paulo Jansen Jansen , Jansen Jansen .
But in places that are outside of Brazil , we &apos;ve created the Pigx , we created a Pigx , which is the equivalent of the &quot; &quot; Karroars . &quot; &quot; And we created a Pigx , which is the &quot; &quot; Karroars . &quot; &quot; And we created the Pigx , which is the &quot; &quot; Karroars . &quot; &quot;
So , everyone else has to join us .
Two years later , there &apos;s a couple of years old , and there are 800 people who are 800 and more than 200 years old , and they had to take a shift from 60 or more of them , and even in their own way .
And when we go back and forth , they would be the richest when you go back and say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know what you &apos;re going to do when you go back .
They could take care of their own ideas , and they could grow their relationships with their neighbors .
And now , I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to find the rest of you in the city of the city and to recognize other unseen faces .
And if you think about the front lines , you can see that without borders , without borders .
They don &apos;t want authority , and there &apos;s more than 20 million in the world .
You know , if you &apos;re seeing someone who &apos;s going to take one of them , don &apos;t meet them as part of our society .
Muko nanoparticles , thank you .

In five Noth , in 1990 , in 1990 , in 1990 , in the 1990s , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the U.K.
They were known to be a great deal , but when they talk about a few months ago , when they started to die , they were prepared to go back to the World Wide Web .
Now , the plans were very close by the FTB .
Unfortunately , in 1990 , World War II , the World Business Organization has never been to face .
And the result in which I was in the end was known by the opposite .
It &apos;s my father .
In 1987 , Pennsylvania , in the course of 2003 , I &apos;ve opened up the world as a kid , and my father would have been celebrated the future , and they didn &apos;t come to the world , and they didn &apos;t talk about the future .
After the age of seven , my family started to change in our family .
I didn &apos;t want to see that my true Islam , a lot of people who have seen a few people witness .
But I &apos;ve learned about this : when people get to know about each other , then we &apos;ve been able to learn about each other , and then we don &apos;t understand why each one is the same as each of us .
Every single time , every single day , every million people who are women who are forced to make their faith in every nation that they want to spend their lives on their own way .
In fact , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , in London , a few weeks ago , in London , a couple of weeks ago in London .
And my father said to her .
We had to go to a ton of cotton , and then we didn &apos;t even know that we were in the secret observer .
My children helped me to hold back to me in the middle of the tea , and the 30 metronomes are helping me to make a job .
So the last laugh came to the next laugh , and the next laugh came to the next laugh , and the result was that , in particular , it was the result of that .
I said , &quot; &quot; Isan . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Irene is a child . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Your father is younger .
All I say was , but after a few years , I actually understood what they &apos;re doing .
They had always thought about the fact that my father was running .
And finally , these people have been known for 700 times more than 700 times the average of the World Trade Bank , which was known as the World Trade Bank , which was known for the death of the World Trade Bank , which was known for the death of six or six months .
These people take care of myself .
&quot; &quot; Excuse me . &quot; &quot; I was like , &quot; &quot; Excuse me .
By the time I was 19 years old , I changed our lives , and the last time I had this change in my life , I had to change our lives .
Some of us would not feel a little bit closer to myself .
When I was in trouble , I was surrounded by a kid , and as a new person , I was surrounded by my children .
I could put my identities in the middle of my own , not in the middle of the hall , but it became clear that it &apos;s the most amazing lesson in the classroom , and it &apos;s the equivalent to that .
So I could read a lot about my time when I was reading a book , and I could watch television and play games .
And so I &apos;ve had conflicts of social communication in my community , in fact , as one of the women who grew up in the middle of my life , I didn &apos;t get ready for the rest of life .
I grew up in a conflict where people and religion as religion and religion .
What led my eyes ?
One of the first experiments that I think we think about is this time when President Obama came in , it was time in 2009 .
I went to college in the University of Medicine in the University of Medicine , in the U.K.
And I was in a team of young people who I was riding around , and as one of the young kids , I didn &apos;t say goodbye to each other , but as one of our lives , I didn &apos;t say goodbye to them .
People have a different way of life .
And I learned that one of the kids I had experienced in the last days of my family .
This is a different story , but I came to realize that I don &apos;t know whether any of us would have to understand whether or not that I don &apos;t know whether or not that I don &apos;t .
More than before I was a father , I had to tell me that I had a feeling that my life was unexpected , that my life was unexpected .
More important than the turn of a larger transformation , in the hotel , in the middle of the road , became a job for the future .
So I was in the presence of people who are different and civilization , and this experiment was played very fundamental on the way that I &apos;ve had the most important role in our culture .
I had taught a great part of my life that I had to learn about the moral question of homosexuality , and in contrast , all the deer .
My job was that I had a chance to work with irrational artists in one of them , and by the way , I &apos;ve got a lot of chance to work out , by the way , as many times as I &apos;ve ever seen as much as possible .
And I went to love with other people , and as one of the smartest people , as one of the most lucky ones , I would love to think about myself , and I don &apos;t want to deal with myself .
And I would like to pretend that when I was a kid , I would like to talk to me about the experience of my life .
I &apos;m not talking about how I &apos;m talking about it , but I &apos;m sorry about what the reason why is that I &apos;m not talking about the reasons why the reasons I &apos;m not talking about it .
Later , &quot; &quot; The Daily Show &quot; &quot; became clear to me , &quot; &quot; The Daily Show me . &quot; &quot; It helped me to be honest with my definition of schizophrenia , and people helped me to talk about the fact that it &apos;s not mutually exclusive .
You had to hit me in the moment when I was talking about the fact that I needed to have a word for the rest of the dictionary .
The first inspiration comes from the inspiration , and the fact that I think that I had to think about the fact that my worldview was more likely to act on the surface of my life .
On a day , I became a conversation with my mother and my mother , and my mother told me that I didn &apos;t take my lifetime for my lifetime .
My mother looked at me with his eyes and said , &quot; &quot; I wonder if I &apos;ve had enough trouble with people . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to give people a lot .
I understood how much more people need to take care of myself .
It &apos;s not my fault .
I was able to change my relationship with my father , my father , my father and my father .
And why would I come up to the truth , and why would I raise the truth ?
It &apos;s quite a lot .
And so I hope that , in fact , whenever I think about it , someone would have a story to tell my story about my story , and I didn &apos;t have fanatical thinking .
In fact , I chose to use my lifelong experience as a tool for my life to tackle my life .
I &apos;m obsessed with that , and I &apos;m going to give them some sense of suffering and praise that I &apos;m going to do .
I &apos;m going to have a tendency to explore the gestures of my father , and I &apos;m going to try to make the gestures of my father &apos;s actions .
And as a simple example of my favorite example of my talk , I &apos;m living in a way that I &apos;m living in the middle of nowhere .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Your morning .
No matter ?
They took me up on their feet . But I wanted to ask you , &quot; &quot; I want to ask you to ask , &quot; &quot; How do you write ?
Nobody written ? No matter , no problem .
A few years ago , I sat with my friend in the restaurant , and I was able to cook .
I was looking at my office , and I said , &quot; There are you ? &quot;
He looked curious to me to think about the word wrong .
He said , &quot; &quot; Do you want it ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No offense , no compassion . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; What do you call it ? &quot; &quot; I know .
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; ( Music ) &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; ( Music ) &quot; &quot; When I &apos;m a French Army ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you &apos;ll do it ! &quot; &quot; He said office .
He would be happy to talk to me . He would say , &quot; &quot; If I had the best queen in this world , I wouldn &apos;t look on it . &quot; &quot; And if I had the best girl in this world .
What do you know if you don &apos;t call the Mu Mu ?
The second word that I was talking about is a young boy , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not an idiot .
How could that talk ?
And then I started thinking .
That was me .
This is what the guy really does !
They don &apos;t tell me what I &apos;m talking about in my own country .
Is it possible ?
How did we get there ?
But here we have a lot of people here , like me , like my own life that I &apos;ve been able to deal with , which is that they &apos;re not only about contemporary and modern , but to tell you that they &apos;re not just about contemporary and modern .
Am I supposed to forget my whole civilization , my ideas , my father and my father ?
When a kid who has a great story about my grandfather could be our best .
I &apos;m talking about it in Arabic in Arabic .
Should I have forgotten to be one of them ?
Who was here ?
And yet , I tried to deal with it .
I didn &apos;t want it to be the wrong version of it .
The language doesn &apos;t respond to the students .
It &apos;s not language , it &apos;s not language , it &apos;s not language , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used to address , but it &apos;s not a language that we &apos;re used in our universities .
If we were , they stopped our clothes .
And what I &apos;m doing is I &apos;m not using it ?
You don &apos;t want to think , we don &apos;t want to use it ?
This is a reality .
But it &apos;s more important we think we &apos;re thinking about .
The language language .
And it says that if you have to be perfect , you should be perfect in Arabic in other languages .
In Arabic in Arabic , in Arabic , it is the Middle East .
How ?
The first time he started to write the first time he started to write a letter .
His whole ideas , all the ideas that are special , and the sound of all the ideas that are special , and the special sound , the tiny boy in the village .
So when he started writing in English Arabic , he had enough press .
In fact , when you write a text in English in English , you feel like that when you write it out in English in English , you &apos;ll make that sense .
You can imagine , you can imagine that in English in English , there &apos;s this gentleman in English .
This is a self-fulfilling prophecy .
Secondly , if you want to kill a bomb , if you want to kill a million miles , the only way to kill a nation is to kill her .
This is a reality that has developed society .
The Germans , the Germans , the wolves , the wolves , these nations .
And so they make the responsibility for protecting themselves .
They &apos;re making it nuts .
And so they can use a lot of money to produce language from their language .
More than them ?
Okay , we &apos;ve never been able to tell us about the way that we &apos;re developing , and we &apos;d like to have a world that didn &apos;t stop us .
Once upon a time , as we &apos;ve been working for developing countries , there were a lot of people who have been trained to grow up in that country , like Mongolia , etc . , and they were able to preserve them in their lives .
They kept their language .
Because if you want to take a product from another place , or if you could take a product from another place , it means that it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not a native word .
You couldn &apos;t believe it had the indigenous product .
They were receptors in the early days , as we were in the early days when we were .
So they had to preserve themselves and produce their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Azah , &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Have you ever remembered it , right ?
Who is , though , and why .
Language is not the promise of our mouth , but it &apos;s not a promise to talk about it .
Language is the kind of mechanism that we have in our own language , which is based on our limbic systems .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Azhasta , &quot; &quot; when every one of you think about the essence of every one of you , the special pictures of each one of you think is special .
Language is one or two words or three words .
That &apos;s how we think about how we think about ourselves , how we think about each other , how we &apos;re seeing each other about how we &apos;re seeing each other .
What is it ?
You can tell you , this is the human condition , or not ?
So if I say , &quot; &quot; Azah , &quot; &quot; and if I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , thank you . &quot; &quot; And if I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , you &apos;re going to be in English .
What do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , it &apos;s good enough , and I &apos;m going to talk to you .
The ideal is to remind us of something special .
There &apos;s a friend who is married with French .
I asked one day , how do you work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , all of this is intimate . But I &apos;ve been working on one day , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been working for a day . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We &apos;ve talked about it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Music ends ) ( Applause )
And he had to tell him , &quot; &quot; How could that be that ?
Who wants to suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Is it me ? &quot; &quot; This is one of a few memes .
So we started thinking about it , so that we can &apos;t deal with the women , and the women are right , and it &apos;s fair to understand that .
And my friend said to me , &quot; &quot; This is my friend I &apos;ve been trying to do with me . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been trying to tell you that when I was listening to myself , I &apos;ve been trying to tell you that when I was listening , I &apos;m going to tell you that when I was listening , I &apos;m going to take my sense of what I felt . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the case : &quot; &quot; I took care of them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
Have me to make that .
( Applause ) What do we do to preserve our language ?
We &apos;ve got this campaign in the past , and we &apos;ve begun to campaign this campaign to preserve our own language .
And so many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why would you be worried ?
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like to lose the headache and the essence of it .
This was the campaign to preserve my language , which was , &quot; &quot; I talk to you about it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about it .
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t call it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose that way .
And if it comes to me , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
We say , ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) We want to change our own reality and our dreams , our desires and everyday life .
We &apos;re not going to be just like ours and we &apos;re thinking about it .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you , &quot; &quot; but you would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you about it .
It &apos;s very simple , at the same time , and it &apos;s so compelling .
And after that , we started a campaign with another campaign .
Now , you don &apos;t see this example , you don &apos;t even see it in the middle of the letter , &quot; &quot; kill the tongue . &quot; &quot; And he wrote &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your tongue ! &quot; &quot; You know .
Why ? In fact , to kill the language .
We need to kill our language .
If we had to kill our language , we had to find our identity .
We had to find our lives .
We had to go back quickly .
This is a serious issue that we have to lose our modern and heritage .
And after that , we went through the sky and the images of girls and the girls .
&quot; &quot; Short &quot; &quot; and boys and boys .
We said , &quot; &quot; jazz . &quot;
And who said , &quot; &quot; Aicha , you &apos;ve talked English . &quot; &quot; And I say , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to tell you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , let me tell you a little bit better about the reality .
I &apos;m going to go on to say &quot; &quot; The Internet . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because we have to experience ourselves .
But what we &apos;ve got to believe is that if we have to believe that if you want to think about it , we need to believe that if we don &apos;t think about it , we need to think about what &apos;s going on and what you need to do , to think about what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s an injury .
If we don &apos;t even know if we can &apos;t fly , and if we don &apos;t take it down , maybe we can make art .
All of you have a great project .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about your core language .
Let &apos;s start on that moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel and a short movie .
Nobody else can rebuild us .
That &apos;s how we could rebuild the language of this day .
You &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way that there &apos;s no way . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not flat .
But we have to believe that we have to go out and believe that the way we &apos;re going to get there is to be part of our debt .
What do you do today ?
Pscrews , who is hungry ?
And if I &apos;ve been able to spend a time in my life , I would like to ask you to ask , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you want to be in English .
But in Arabic , in Arabic , in Arabic , don &apos;t write all the way to the Mall .
( Applause ) This is great ! This is not language .
You can go into the viral language .
It &apos;s not easy to go back from the ground .
This is the first thing we can do .
Secondly , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;ve got to make each other to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to take care of the importance of hope that we need to preserve that language .
And now , I &apos;m opening up to you .
It &apos;s the first time that the first time it comes from the language of language .
I &apos;m going to tell him that when I was born , I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; This is the honor of the Sun . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I
( Applause ) So , we &apos;re able to put ourselves in this way . ( Applause )
And so a few years ago , the American fleet of New York has been able to see the Indian fleet of 3D .
I &apos;ve learned a couple of things when I &apos;ve done this 30 days .
And when it comes back to the months , it became more likely to stop .
For a month , I took a picture every day .
When I started 30 days ago , I started talking about 30 days ago when I started to test 30 days after exams .
And I learned that I learned .
By the way , it &apos;s about , by the way , writing about this whole day without writing promises .
But you &apos;ll end .
That &apos;s a lot .
I don &apos;t have to tell him to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care .
No , if I want to say , I &apos;m writing .
And I learned that I &apos;ve learned that small , competitive , spontaneous and continuously .
Well , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
It &apos;s the first day that I started to University the University of the University of hopes and optimization with our hopes for our first day .
I &apos;ve read a good story from the school , and I started to talk about the way that we had to deal with love , and I started to talk about the way that I was living on a daily basis .
This is a very good image of the students who had stolen , high-energy , and a very compelling image .
And I was afraid that I was afraid that I was very afraid of the spaces that I was able to feel , and I was afraid of the spaces that I had to feel in the future , and I was afraid of empty space .
But I &apos;ve learned to make these fears better .
It was so compelling that it was so compelling that I had no idea , and I had no idea that when I started to get the first word , the first thing I did was to start the icon .
As a result , I had to tell you , as a result of my face , my wife , my wife , my wife , I was able to tell you that when I left the hotel , I had a very good voice for the time to leave the hotel .
There was no faith in any of us . I was standing in the middle of the glacier and accuracy .
In the Sardinia , the books were in the batteries .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s opening the door . &quot; &quot; I was equal .
This was a beginning . It came .
And before week , I &apos;ve just talked to me about my name for weeks .
He said , &quot; Oh , he &apos;s going to go ahead . &quot;
It would sound like that in the middle of the universe , it would sound like a parent and hope that it would be friendly and hopeful .
For example , when I had talked about the people that I had been involved in , I had to hide my real sense of life .
I didn &apos;t worry about my time , but I felt that when I was working with my beliefs , I would feel like I was working on my shoulder , and I would feel like I was working .
And I talked about what I was talking about , and it came back .
And it came out of the manuscript , and the normal people came out : normal people don &apos;t talk about equal stories .
Now , a little bit of fear started to get a little bit of fear . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
I had to take care of my arm .
And my concern is that I &apos;ve seen a lot of attention to my self that I had been listening to my mom , and as I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , my concern is that , as you know , I &apos;m going to shake my mind .
I needed that interest , and I needed to help him , and I started talking to him about my grandmother .
And so I &apos;m at that moment .
I was able to manage a psychologist , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to make a psychologist a psychologist . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve managed to manage the psychologist .
For example , I used to work as if I used to work as a child , and I would like to work as if I could go to the University of New York , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to go ahead and say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m going to have to read about the news about six hours . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have to read the news .
After that , it started to come out of my grandmother .
When I was hungry , I was devastated to the prison , and then he had schizophrenia , and then the bottom line is a sense of hope , a sense of hope , a sense of hope .
I &apos;m afraid that I &apos;m not talking about my favorite life , but I &apos;m afraid that I was afraid that I &apos;m not talking about the fact that I &apos;m not talking about it .
This kind of thing would lead to a network , a kind of psychological collapse , and the result of the results began to increase the number of times and more and more and more and less .
I had to go back to my world and hope that I &apos;m not going to leave my world with such noises .
For example , if I &apos;m going to tell them , I &apos;m going to tell them that I &apos;m going to tell you about my life , my life would change my life , to change my life .
First of all , a few months ago , for example , as we did three months from my head , then we were able to get more and more and more and more and less .
You see the horizon of water ?
Stop on the road up on the road , and I was rewarded by the teacher , and that &apos;s the myth .
And so we had this kind of fear that I didn &apos;t have to make it clear , and I didn &apos;t tell myself whether I was in this fight , and in fact , I didn &apos;t have a lot of responsibility and peace .
Two years later , my rabbi started to suck .
I was in love with all the rest of the rest : crazy sounds , and they &apos;ve talked about it .
It &apos;s a great tribute to me , and the moral imperative for the physical words , the physical words , the moral imperative for humanists , to me . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I want to make it better than schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; And they were a line from a line , and I &apos;d like to hold my head on a line , and I &apos;d like to hold my head on a line .
Now , now , when I look at those stories , I think that one of the people who &apos;s going to die and hopefully get rid of the fact that one generation is saved .
It was sent to a voice , and it &apos;s been sent to the sky , and in the end , what I &apos;ve had to do is to go back to one person that I had to do .
Many people have been struck by me , and they &apos;re not going to be , but they &apos;re not going to be able to deal with people , but they &apos;ve been able to help me with people who have helped to help me .
The other day , and my partners have been equal to me , and my partners have been unable to wait until one day , and I &apos;m ready to wait until one day , and I &apos;m ready to wait until one day , and I &apos;m ready to go back to it , but for that time , I had a chance to go back to my family , but for that time , I didn &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t hurt you .
Now , I believe that the authenticity will .
Sometimes , if it rains in Italy , they come back and forth . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to take a bow . &quot; &quot; And in 14 minutes , I don &apos;t thank you for me to thank you with me , and in 14 minutes , you don &apos;t have to thank those beautiful people .
But they had to have a tendency to get involved in the spirit of the spirit that I had had .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I would say , &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; Well , the most exciting time I &apos;ve ever talked about something that I &apos;ve always talked about when I &apos;ve talked about something that I &apos;ve always talked about when I &apos;ve talked about what I &apos;ve been talking about when I &apos;ve talked about what I &apos;ve been talking about when I &apos;ve talked about what I &apos;m talking about .
And of course , when they came back and forth , they &apos;re hard to believe that when they came to think about it , I would like to learn from the first part of my first story .
For example , I &apos;ve been able to learn from my home to my house , and I &apos;ve learned to tell you about the fear that I &apos;m going to be able to tell you about the fear and skills that I &apos;ve ever experienced .
I loved them .
And even if I was in the door of my parents , even if my parents were sitting in the door of my parents , I &apos;ve been hearing about that .
To myself , there was a lot in home because there was a lot of people sitting in the middle of home , and a lot of people sitting in the middle of the room , in the middle of the room .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; No matter , no matter .
Have you ever seen plastic ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a mess .
And then I was able to thank the words in the back of the audience , as opposed to the fact that I was able to take care of myself to remind myself of how much safe the feeling I &apos;m feeling in : how much safe the feeling I &apos;m going to be aware of , because I could tell you about how much safe time , and I &apos;m also convinced that I didn &apos;t know why .
I started to tell them more , but I started giving them a lot better , but I started to talk about the way that we need to learn about our communication and help .
And I learned that every single one of those things that I &apos;ve never been able to solve , I &apos;ve learned about the fact that I &apos;ve never been able to figure out what I &apos;ve never been able to solve .
They were going to take their place , and they were going to come back to their words , and I &apos;ve discovered that all sorts of sounds , and I &apos;ve explored these stories , and I &apos;ve discovered that these voices were very specific .
After all , I &apos;m sorry , when I came back with this , I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;ve been disengaged in various parts of the radiation , and this time , I went back to the other side , and I went back to the other .
After the first time , 10 years after I was equal to the first time , I was in a graduate school in psychology , and a year later , after a year , I got a high-grade blob of high-grade steel .
One of the stories of the early 20th century was to me .
I mean , I &apos;m sorry about it .
Like , you know , you &apos;ve been known to be known .
At the same time , two talks would have to listen to each other .
I &apos;ve been working in a country in general health , and I &apos;ve been able to show you that the most important question that I &apos;m going to have to ask is , is that the most important question that we have to ask , is that the most important question is , what should you ask ?
For all this time I &apos;m listening to them , I &apos;ve learned about what I &apos;ve been hearing about , and the sense of compassion , and the sense of compassion .
And I could help me to help the most compelling noises that I &apos;m living in for the most part .
Now , in fact , we &apos;ve been very proud of the way that we &apos;re going to see the fact that we don &apos;t know that when we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to see the fact that we don &apos;t know that the way that we &apos;re going to take place in the middle of the United States is that , in fact , that we don &apos;t have to deal with Mario Robio and Dr. Sandra , and Dr. Sandzley , who &apos;s a great deal of life , is
We need to tell them that they need to invest in their hopes and recognize stories from the brink of dignity and emotions .
It &apos;s possible that this is possible , and it &apos;s also not .
There &apos;s a way that it &apos;s kind of like this , which is that social change doesn &apos;t go back to change .
It &apos;s not going to take human beings .
We don &apos;t want to get people who don &apos;t fear .
To me , you know , you know , you know , you can &apos;t tell you that when you &apos;re talking about justice and respect , you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
In the last 20 years , you can see that when you &apos;re going to be lucky enough to be 30 years old , there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to expand their potential , and they &apos;ve been able to expand their potential , and we &apos;re in the process of thinking about the possibility of people who are , in fact , in terms of the global potential .
Now , like the Piter Levine , you have an app that has an app that has an app that has to take place from human health to human health .
This is what we &apos;re seeing from the perspective of someone who needs to take care of somebody who needs to take care of somebody who needs to take care of them , to make sure that they need to take care of them .
We need to be able to remember , and we &apos;ve got to be able to remember , and we need to remember .
We &apos;re kind of like . We don &apos;t .
It &apos;s not going to take what we have in the mountain , and it &apos;s not going to be too long .
It &apos;s unexpected .
One guy told me , &quot; &quot; Tell me what &apos;s going on when the front of the front covers .
Kevin &apos;s voice . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to talk about my internship .
But this is the picture ?
Because of course , this is not a picture that you can see with your camera .
Now , in the West , my aunt , when I was 15 years old , I started to get 15 years old .
I was struck by the marathon with the previous artist , but in a little different way , because I could use a camera that &apos;s been used for a camera .
You &apos;re going to take a picture with a computer with a computer , and it &apos;s ready when it &apos;s printed .
And so , the image of the photo is not only about the right place .
I thought I could do this .
And so I wanted to make something different , something that works after you took pictures .
Here &apos;s images like this : this is the realization that this works .
But it turned out to be an unexpected game .
And yet , it &apos;s very close to reality .
Or , like , images like this — you can also see the pictures of the dark , the color of the dark , and all of that kind of disintegration .
Now , when I think about the Reagan , I &apos;m holding it in theory .
Because , of course , these are not the pictures that we can really see , but I want to have an image that &apos;s going to be able to make a camera .
I want to have a little bit of ideas to deal with you .
So this is a lot more likely to hold the right idea more than hold .
So what does it actually cost to the fact that it &apos;s the opposite ?
Do you don &apos;t think about it with these words ?
Does it matter ?
What &apos;s going on ?
Sometimes it comes from injury .
But then , in the end , how do you deal with a two-dimensional scale , in 2D 2D .
It &apos;s really what the reality is , what &apos;s going to happen .
So the basic idea is that it &apos;s pretty easy .
I &apos;m going to put it in a place where I &apos;m going to create an alternative , an alternative reality that I created an alternative reality .
So I show you a simple example .
Here are three numbers in perfect way that we can imagine that there &apos;s a physical way to be able to live in a three-dimensional three-dimensional world .
But in a certain way , it looks like a three-dimensional three-dimensional object that exists in the West .
And we also know that there can &apos;t exist .
So we play games with our brains , because our brains don &apos;t understand the reality .
And I &apos;ll see the exact same process , and I &apos;m seeing the same process .
And it &apos;s actually connected to each other .
So what we &apos;re thinking about is a picture of a picture that we don &apos;t think about , in our everyday lives , in our everyday lives .
It &apos;s really important that it &apos;s really important to explain it , because it &apos;s really important , because it seems to be wrong .
And what I want to say to you is that we &apos;ve got three simple pictures that we &apos;ve got to do .
As you see , these images don &apos;t have special implications .
But in essence , there &apos;s something like this .
So in the first month , the pictures have to be similar to the images of the collection .
Secondly , all of the pictures have to be able to navigate with light .
And it &apos;s in two ways , and it &apos;s taken out of the same payload as the same overload and the same .
And third , we &apos;ve talked about the emergence of a picture , and then the next one is to tell us that one of the other things that other people started from the rise started to act .
It &apos;s the kind of thing that it &apos;s been created in the way that the cluster is created .
In fact , we &apos;re able to create the boundaries between the various images between the different images between the different images , the contrast between these different images , and the fact that we make boundaries from different images , and in fact , if you &apos;re able to use the boundaries between different images , you could have hundreds of thousands of people .
Here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) People can think that this is an image of a place where it &apos;s an artist , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
But actually , this is a picture of a different set of locations that were mixed together .
I think you need a place where you can make a place , a place where you need to change your ideas .
But it takes a lot of planning .
And I could have a few months trying to find a different way to find the various things that I &apos;ve had to complete parts of the network .
For example , the fish took my picture .
They &apos;re different kinds of shoes .
And the fishery is taken on a 7th of January .
And I was in red , even in the middle of the island , in the middle of the island to make Sweden more Sweden .
So it &apos;s going to take a closer and closer to reality .
Every time a line , it starts with ideas .
And then you get different pictures .
And it &apos;s sort of like , every single piece of music .
And if you take pictures of images , then the results are quite beautifully , and it &apos;s also very surreal .
So the only thing we need , and the only thing that we need is our imagination , is our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Julian , you &apos;re fine .
This was a data given that you &apos;ve been published , which is published all of the world &apos;s coverage about the whole world in the last decade .
Is it possible ?
Julian Aspen : Yes , right ?
The rest of the world is a big deal , right ? A little activist who &apos;s going to be able to make that awful lot more than all the world &apos;s press press .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people look like this ?
How do you preserve it ?
JA : What we &apos;ve known about is that what we &apos;ve known about is what we &apos;ve known about .
We don &apos;t take care of what you &apos;re watching , which is to make information to allow the information to help us , to ensure that we &apos;re going to make the legislation to protect the laws of legislation , to ensure that we can preserve the laws of legislation .
It turns out that the creation of creation and what it means is that it &apos;s kind of like a password in the news , which is it &apos;s kind of like , you know , it &apos;s kind of hard to say , &quot; &quot; This is a little tough . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s a little hard to say — we &apos;ve got to believe that in the public world , we &apos;re protecting ourselves from the public .
CA : So , you know , you &apos;re going to tell you about the rights of the literature . You don &apos;t even know who you are .
JA : It &apos;s true . It &apos;s true . We don &apos;t know if we can read them in a way , if we put it in the box .
( Laughter ) Zetas .
( Laughter ) CA : I think it &apos;s the CA-di , which I think you &apos;re asked to ask for TED . ( Laughter )
So I think I &apos;m looking at the jokes .
This is the data that happens a few years ago .
Here we go .
It was a story .
Have you talk about how you don &apos;t leak ?
JA : This is the Kroll Reef Reef .
And after year , after year after year , Kenya has been studying Kenya .
In Kenya , Kenya has been used to be used by Daniel juice in Kenya .
He was in Nigeria .
When the power of Coke came to a war with the power of Coke , they &apos;ve been able to fight for two million shillings .
And it &apos;s also used as a political motive with the fact that the most prolific man , in fact , with the highest man in the world .
Kenya is the book of Kenya .
In 2009 , there was a few months ago in 2009 , and I had to go back to Benki a few months ago .
This is the idea that President Kichk said that the next one we had to put in the hands of another prime minister was published three days later , and after that , after that , after that event , President Kibs were killed after that .
CA : The length of a long dictionary — not to deal with the public American government , not to deal with the roads , and then you think about it .
JA : Yes . Well , what happened was that it was in the history of Sarajevo , and then in the country , in the country , in Tanzania and elsewhere in Africa .
He came from abroad .
In a few days , Kenya has begun to write comfortable writing about the fact that in a few days .
By the way , it was broadcast in Kenya in Kenya , and in the case of Kenya security , it changed 10 percent of the details , which would change the results from that .
CA : So the data really changed the world that you &apos;re leaked ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : This time , this is a video that you have to talk about .
The video is a little tall . This is a short clip .
And I &apos;m just thinking about it , there &apos;s a little bit on this video .
Rodo : ...
Now , the predictions are going on .
It &apos;s the Enlightenment .
When we see it , it &apos;s okay .
It &apos;s a kick .
Ooh , hey !
( Laughter ) Get out to go out of the rubble , go on . ( Laughter )
The Otel Brx Twin , Bukzox , Bukzox , Buckminster Fuller .
They needed to go back .
We killed , we killed eight grandmothers .
There are two assets , and we keep track of it .
It died . It died .
Two-Six , Twox , Tw-jex , we act .
It &apos;s an option . It &apos;s a donation .
Zullinger , Kingala , has been solved .
CA : So how did this sound ?
JA : That &apos;s also the people who have these jobs .
This video was sent two grandmothers in Haiti .
This is actually one of the three neurons in the video .
CA : Have you ever died on this person who was born in this humanized two-digit number ?
JA : Yes . Two Reuters workers died , two children .
And in my case , 18626 , man died .
CA : This is the publication of this publication .
And what was the reason why ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I think people saw the status of power .
They don &apos;t even laugh by the way that they &apos;re going to laugh on the screen , and they don &apos;t laugh by the way that they laugh — and even if they don &apos;t have any reason , they don &apos;t even have any reason .
And there were two inmates who had seen their work and their own work .
CA : Now , the U.S. is kind of familiar to the U.S.
Is that true ?
JA : We &apos;ve made these pictures of denial .
The five days ago , after 150 days , they were committed to 150 years old .
This year , we &apos;ve been broadcast to the University of Reychard America , but it doesn &apos;t work with it .
I had a lot of people .
CA : If you had to get the diplomatic documents of the U.S. ?
JA : We need to publish them . ( CA : Eleberry knee ? ) JA : Yes . ( CA : So why from why ? &quot; &quot; JA : What &apos;s wrong ? &quot; &quot; JA : In fact , what &apos;s going on in my country is that in fact what the country is doing .
This is the kind of material that we open up secret .
CA : We &apos;re going to talk about that .
Now , what do you expect ?
Have you ever been thinking about the secret of the secret documents ?
JA : There &apos;s such a question that &apos;s going to make the world available to the world , which is what information is worth of .
There are many different languages .
It &apos;s a great deal to hide if you &apos;re going to make the economic press , which is a new and good thing to hide , and the institutions that allow them to be able to hide the information themselves .
The deck is always going to happen . Jarrett &apos;s history depends on it .
CA : But it &apos;s not a little safe , but when people don &apos;t sit there , people don &apos;t hang out of you .
JA : You don &apos;t know what we &apos;re flying .
So , we &apos;re going to preserve that .
Some of them have information online , and then we get broadcast back to that .
There &apos;s also a law that has a law — it &apos;s like , in fact , the people who don &apos;t care about the power of the disease , but we actually work with these stories .
CA : All crazy .
If the son came to tell you , a friend of people who are going to ask you , say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , what do you want to do with your own purpose ?
The people of America show that when people die , they laugh .
This shows that in millions of people in this world , people have been unable to feel human emotion .
I don &apos;t like my son . What do you do with you ? &quot; &quot; How did you respond ?
JA : These are all sorts of people .
But in fact , if you stay alive , we don &apos;t need people to see that video there are no need to see this video .
They don &apos;t change their minds . They don &apos;t change their emotions .
They &apos;ll see every day .
It will change people to change the interest of people who are paid for war .
CA : So you don &apos;t find the way that governments and companies don &apos;t find a way to make their secret brand secret .
It &apos;s very intimate .
But the bizarre thing is that if you don &apos;t want to light up your interests , you &apos;re not going to keep track of yourself .
JA : It &apos;s not exactly what it &apos;s like . You know , WikiLear .
Or we don &apos;t have any data that &apos;s going on .
If they don &apos;t think about it , it &apos;s hard for us to take care of it . We want to take care of it .
CA : I &apos;m talking about what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about is that when I think about it , what do they think ?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeap and Julian .
One — you can see the concerns of the need .
The other is a real danger .
Who &apos;s thinking about it ?
How do you get a safe deal ?
JA : Okay , so it has to be a few guys .
CA : I have these interviews , Julian .
We have a little bit better .
This is not published yet , but I think it will be broadcast at TED .
What kind of interesting is that the kind of curious difference is ?
What is it ?
JA : This is a example of what we see every day .
In the last year , in November — in January , in November , the Gulf of Mexico , in November , in January , there was also no way of blindness .
We had this idea of an engineer , which is , actually , in the way that the payload would take place in the middle of the year , and a half of them would be saved by a lot of people .
And in the case of the press , the government and other people were there .
But in fact , there was no relationship with them with them , and a little hard deal with them .
We didn &apos;t really know who she was writing and what she was about .
We would have a little bit to be able to play the game .
And so , in fact , we looked back to the literature , and we said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit .
We can &apos;t even know what we &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s the good news , but we can &apos;t see the imagery we can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t see that the data was going to find the data , and we had to ask the company , &quot; &quot; We want to find out the data . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In the answer , &quot; &quot; We want to find out the data .
Have you talk about anything ?
Don &apos;t tell you about the law ?
You can tell you ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re going to get a picture in Worster IED ID.
That &apos;s what I did .
( Applause ) These are all sorts of people .
The printing press is one of the ways that it &apos;s going to be a pattern of text .
CA : Do you want to make it ?
JA : Yes , we &apos;ve also been working on the process for all of us , and the engineers are working on , and the engineers do the future .
We &apos;ve spent the past few months trying to rethink the stories that we &apos;ve been trying to reconstruct the past few months for the past few months .
This is a little problem .
Now , as we &apos;ve started a new process , we &apos;ve been able to put a lot of work in our hands , and we have enough workers to take all of these data devices , even if we have enough people to take the data out of it .
CA : Tell you about what you &apos;re supposed to say about , to say , &quot; &quot; You know , what you need to do ?
JA : Yes . We &apos;re going to believe .
The information that we have in our cities is that in a few different ways , there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be able to grow up , and we need people to be able to deal with the problems of danger .
CA : So , why would you say why you start this ?
And when I said , I &apos;m sorry , you don &apos;t change the 37 schools in a child .
Right ?
JA : The movie was a film where I &apos;m not going to open up the film , and one of the results was the result of two .
( Laughter ) CA : Now , the psychologist , I think , would be like paranoia paranoia .
JA : Do you hold the movie ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : So , when I did my book , you could also see that when you were old age , there were thousands of problems .
JA : Jarrett .
I was one of the senior young fans list .
I &apos;ve been obsessed with the fan that I &apos;ve made from old age .
We need to pretend to make a little bit .
It &apos;s possible to make different things .
Unfortunately , despite the fact that most of the flaminmitters are not going to pay for the Russian bank account for the Russians .
It &apos;s not just as a result of a car before .
CA : Well , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be , if you don &apos;t have a chance to take care of your grandmother .
You could give you a short amount of information about them , or why do you talk about things ?
JA : So I think that was the case .
But the main value : I think that I don &apos;t think about it , and people don &apos;t create machines , and they &apos;re helping to help them .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from the fact that I &apos;ve actually learned from people like that .
CA : And I don &apos;t create a lot of people who don &apos;t create a human being able to preserve them ?
JA : I &apos;m a little depressed , I don &apos;t show the network , I don &apos;t show the network , but in this way , I &apos;ve managed to preserve the people from the ceremony .
This is what I &apos;ve been hearing for a long time .
CA : You could talk about what &apos;s going on in the last few minutes ?
The information that you published there was the problem that you &apos;re published , and it was given to the news that he had to put information on the news .
And in fact , it became a census .
You created a good name . And then what happened ?
JA : This was huge .
It was the equivalent of the economic .
It was one of the largest beetles in the world .
The banking alternative is 10 times more than the other industry .
We published this information in the last year .
It &apos;s about five minutes from a letter from a letter to English .
We traveled to the Sabbath , and we got a lot of profits in the Sabbath , and we came up with a question about whether we had a problem .
Every single one of the people would have thought to be more likely to be more likely to be able to get this ring back , and then , after all , a few seconds ago , a new chassis project would have been given to the so-called &quot; &quot; Congressmen , &quot; &quot; which is one of the most important laws of legislation in the world , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize , the Nobel Prize in the world .
The South Africa has been able to go into the system for the other scandal .
And one month ago , it was in the U.K.
CA : Viking .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s take the Axout of the Golden th , Julian , I &apos;m okay .
How do you believe that what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot; &quot; Now , the first thing that &apos;s going to work is that everything is going to work in secret terms , if you don &apos;t want to hurt , people will do it ?
JA : I &apos;m not sure how it works .
All over the world , like the United States and the United States and the United States , all over the world are increasing .
It &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s very interesting . We can change everything with a lot .
CA : Well , I feel like I &apos;m not sure what we &apos;re talking about , Julian , thank you , thank you .
JA : Thank you . Thank you . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m a printer .
It &apos;s my job to tell you about a story , and I want to talk to you a little bit about writing about the story of writing , and I &apos;d like to talk a little bit about the literature called gin .
But let me give you a story before you start talking about them .
Now , I &apos;m going to use words , you know , some of the great things — you &apos;re going to be able to go back to a couple of lectures .
In the stratosphere , I was born in the middle of France .
And after that , there are less moments of parenting , and I &apos;ve come back with my mother , and I &apos;ve come to Russia .
So I grew up as a single kid in the middle of a single moment .
In the 1970s , in the 1970s , in the 1970s .
I grew up with a large village where many of the families there were in the middle of my family , and I grew up with my mother in the woods .
Actually , I grew up with two Jewish women in the world .
On a side side , on a side , I was my mother , contemporary , Muslim , hunters .
On the other hand side , I &apos;ve always been religious , very religious , more prosperous , less marginalized grandmothers .
My grandmother looked at her , and she was looking at her , and he was able to figure out how to make the devil eye .
In their minds , people who have been living in their hands were visiting grandmothers .
Every time my grandmother went mad , all the way to get rid of the red was to get rid of all the girls .
And then I would like to think about each other .
A week later , after a week , they came to the ceremony .
I know that I think that science would sound strange to me , and I think that I would like to talk a lot about what people would like to be worried about , but I don &apos;t see any people who are going to have to be able to take care of somebody who &apos;s going to take care of them .
Have I asked him how to make it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s a lot of apples , but the power is the power of the power . &quot; &quot; And in my study , there &apos;s a lot of important lessons . If you want to do anything in life , whether you want to do anything in life , whether you want to do anything in life , whether you want to do it .
And in the eye , it comes from .
Every one of us has now become the equivalent of social and heritage sites .
We are all of our rights .
We &apos;re born in a certain way , and we &apos;re born in a certain way .
But when we don &apos;t have a connection with a world that we &apos;re not talking about , we don &apos;t even know if we &apos;re going to be able to take care of people from the world .
We don &apos;t know if we can afford to lose our dignity . &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve got a lot of dignity in our lives .
Our friends , our neighbors , our neighbors , our friends , our family , the way our family comes from us , and if we have a lot of people , we don &apos;t think about our own way .
And like my grandmother , women like my grandmother , they &apos;re going to do something like a piece of day , or a bust of the rest of the day .
This is the kind of belief that there &apos;s a lot of faith that a man can &apos;t look at him for a while .
It &apos;s one of the largest hazards of our world who share ideas with people who share their ideas , are one of the largest hazards .
And this is everywhere , among liberals , between liberals and liberals and faith , they have fought and fought .
We &apos;re going to be able to speculate in terms of what we &apos;re going to do , and we have some stereo types of people .
Now , my idea of writing this is the fundamental path of writing in the dictionary .
Now , if we can &apos;t get borders in the sky , we can &apos;t tell the boundaries in the sky .
And so what we see is that we can even know what we see .
When I was eight , I started to write stories .
One day my mother gave me a color , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , my father would have a good idea .
Now , I think that when I think about it , I think that when I think about it at that time , a little bit of fear .
I &apos;m not going to share my story with my family family , but I didn &apos;t talk about the stories that I didn &apos;t talk about .
I &apos;d like to tell you that I would like to talk enough to the words that I was playing with , and I was able to tell me that what I was touching was a very good idea , and my mother had been thinking about it .
But it didn &apos;t know that I thought , I think I would think that my life was more subtle than that , and what I want to do is write about my life .
I started to write about it , but I started to write about other things about myself .
That &apos;s how I started to type in love .
First of all , I &apos;m writing a lot more than what I &apos;m writing about for myself .
( Music ) ( Music ends ) Now , this is what I &apos;m going to do with my inner presentation .
And in this circle , another thing happened in this circle .
My mother became a diplomat .
And I went from this little , and I went through the middle of the middle of this area , and I went to the middle of my hometown , and I went on to school .
The first time there was , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the typical foreign outsider , &quot; &quot; I had kids all the way to me , and all the Yemeni kids had kids , and that would have been a great deal of democracy .
As in contrast , the kids would have been treated as if they weren &apos;t their friends , they didn &apos;t think they were themselves .
We looked like some of the United States , and it was fun , and it &apos;s fun to deal with a bad mistake in the gift of every church .
As a kid , she was translated into the tongue , and it was always hurt .
And so , when I was in this school , when I was in this school , what happened was that when I was in this school , a species called &quot; &quot; The Blank , &quot; &quot; and the Erosiov music in the universe has a zero .
( Laughter ) And then I became a reasonable architect about being able to come back from the middle school class .
For the first time , I &apos;ve seen that in school .
All the kids would ask about &quot; &quot; Midivil . &quot; &quot; And they asked me about the &quot; &quot; Midivil Exprest &quot; &quot; — they said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do I think they &apos;re doing ?
And I &apos;ve learned about these three string types of species that are connected to the species , and they had the confusion .
After Spanish , Germany , Germany went back to Germany .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking about this , I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking about it .
It &apos;s about me , and I think about the fact that I think it &apos;s fair to me — I &apos;m not sure if I was in the middle of life .
I &apos;ve been reminded of my 20 years old in Sierra Leone .
I lived in a living environment and I lived in a living environment , and I wrote one of my books .
In 1990 , I was there when I was in exile .
And when you go out and see what I saw when I went out of the building , I was on my stage .
He had a feeling , an old vendor , who was not selling it in the store in the store , and he would tell you that he would never sell a drink with men .
On the end , a long line in the eye , in the eye of the eye , put it on a mess .
And I saw that when I ran out of bed nets with his hand , I saw that he had a chance to take care of him from bed nets , and that &apos;s what I thought about as a result of that , in fact , in my opinion , in the case of what &apos;s going on .
When we get rid of the death and the Titanic , we have our common sense of the world that we have in our world .
And I &apos;ve always believed in stories about it .
I don &apos;t want to tell you that if you don &apos;t want to tell you that the literature is strong , but we don &apos;t have a good idea , and we start to recognize the people we &apos;re not talking about , and sometimes we start to know about the people we &apos;re not talking about , and sometimes we don &apos;t know about the people we &apos;re not talking about .
And after that , I went to the roof , and then I went to see girls in Bosnian girls .
Not only is a geographical trip , but the language of language is really changing .
I started to write English .
I have no idea what I &apos;m going to do , I &apos;m sorry about why I &apos;m not talking about the reason why I &apos;m going to write my life .
I like to write a star , and my talk would be more ethical and moral . I think I like to write English in English .
I think I &apos;d like to make other kinds of connections .
And as millions of people in the world around the world , I &apos;ve also learned later that English is going to be a place where English is later .
And when it comes to the language , you have to lose a lot of learning to learn .
And as usual , we want to talk more about it , we want to make better , better , better — we want to do better .
This difference is scary .
But if we learn from it , it can tell us that it could be style .
And this was what I learned in Bosgrade — which was a mountain in the mountain .
And then I could go back to my grandmother bedtime prayers to my grandmother &apos;s day , my grandmother , my grandmother , my grandmother , and then I could go back to one another .
My God loved my God .
( Laughter ) But instead , I went to try to make a decision .
And so I started to go back to where my wife had found that I had found it , and I couldn &apos;t tell you how much the world &apos;s going on in another factor .
Part of me always , in fact , is physical and visceral .
It &apos;s almost as if I &apos;ve always been a story for me to share my stories .
And when I think about it , I &apos;m thinking about it as the story more than the story of the story more than one story .
I &apos;d like to give you an idea about this problem with you .
One of the things I wrote in English , one of the things I wrote in English , who was in America .
He said , &quot; &quot; I like the book . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You could write a little bit differently . &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked what I mean .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , if you think about the front of you , you have a lot of jargon , &quot; &quot; You know , there are a lot of Americans , and there &apos;s one of the Russians , and there &apos;s only Turkish . &quot; &quot; In fact , in Boston , in Boston , in Boston , in Boston , there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to tell me about what they want to say . &quot; &quot; But I don &apos;t know what I mean .
But I can also tell him , I &apos;m always going to try to do it .
He wanted me to be my father .
He wanted it to be a book called &quot; &quot; in the book , &quot; &quot; because I &apos;m a species name .
We talk about the world that we &apos;ve always talked about to change the world , and we can see that when we &apos;ve talked about it , we can see the story of politics , and that &apos;s how they affect it .
Most of the publishers don &apos;t even agree with that .
If you talk about the Muslim world with Islam , when you &apos;re talking about Islam , it will be better if you think about Islam as women don &apos;t happy .
More of the more information , the sad story of information , that you don &apos;t have to go away from your job , you don &apos;t have to go away from your appetite .
In fact , I &apos;m sorry about the world in the literature .
The printer is not like creative people who have ideas with their ideas , but they look like a few writers , a few writers from a variety of species , one of which is from Nigeria .
It doesn &apos;t matter if we don &apos;t think about our civilization .
In fact , when we took the printer and travel in the late &apos; 30s , I asked him to ask him about homosexuality a few times about homosexuality .
The smartest person who took it to make it valuable as a blue printer , and he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t see , I don &apos;t see anything else in others ? &quot; &quot; And if you &apos;re in the same way , we can imagine that if we can tag black , we don &apos;t have anything to do .
There &apos;s a kind of negotiation that has been categorized in a very strange literature called &quot; &quot; The Vagina Monologues &quot; &quot; which has been broadcast to all kinds of publishers .
About 10 years ago , the first hundred years ago in the University of Harvard Square .
We were three articles , a little boy , a few months ago , and one of the things that I &apos;m going to do in Turkish .
( Laughter ) But what we &apos;re putting together is that we don &apos;t have the numbers or whether or not .
We had just finished .
They &apos;re expecting real stories to write real stories .
It &apos;s been translated into such literature .
They &apos;re not just writers , but they become more likely to be the nodding of the bigger mass .
I &apos;m going to tell you that this story doesn &apos;t exist in women .
All over the world .
For the first time in 2009 , I saw that in the last year in 2009 , in 2008 , I saw that in the last year .
And I tried to work , and I &apos;m working with women with the eyes of women and my family .
The little story was made by the big story , and the small story was set .
And so some of the things that I had written about — I wrote a lot about Ernest , and some of them had been involved .
But in that moment , I &apos;d like to tell you , this is just literature .
Just story .
I don &apos;t want to reduce the value of what I saw when you say &quot; &quot; story . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to cut it .
I don &apos;t know how to deal with such fiction , but I &apos;m forced to support .
The printer is known to be known as a collection of books , but the political books are available today , and today &apos;s language is not language .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Now , there &apos;s this quote : &quot; &quot; Oh , what &apos;s wrong with the quality of clarity and opportunity .
And it &apos;s an artist who is an artist . &quot; &quot; The politics of politics takes us apart from us .
One of them is a common promise .
The other thing is that the other .
One is gravity .
It &apos;s not the front door .
I could do a lot of people .
In contrast , it &apos;s water .
They had to tell you that when they went to &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell us , &quot; &quot; they had to tell me that they had to tell the stories that they weren &apos;t worried about .
They change their sounds , they would change their sounds , and they were shaped by them .
It &apos;s the promise to listen to him , the people who are suffering from poverty , even if it &apos;s not .
The captain of the borders , the Middle East Africa , the Balkans , the Balkans , the Balkans , the Balkans .
Today , stories are continuing to overcome borders .
When a country comes in , and the Israeli political black black men , they don &apos;t listen to each other . &quot; &quot; But they get the story of the story , the story of the winner , the story of the winner , and the story of the winner .
It has to take our books far faster .
If you don &apos;t do it , it &apos;s not good .
The books that are going to have to do with these books , and the kids who are going to be ashamed of them .
But there &apos;s also also the security of books .
After all , when the printer came across the globe , the first thing in the middle of the day is that the first job of the exhibition was going to go out in the middle of the middle of the United States .
So , you can say , &quot; &quot; Well , what can &apos;t you know if it can &apos;t be the way that you can &apos;t , but it &apos;s more tangible than ignorance . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have to deal with the problem today . &quot; &quot; We know a lot about whether any of us can know about the fact that we know about each other , more or more of us — we don &apos;t think about the fact that we can see ourselves from ourselves .
There &apos;s such a thing that I love : Walking motion .
And one of the things is fixed .
The other hand is permanent , permanent abuse .
And I think it &apos;s hard .
One of the things that I wrote in my blog is that it &apos;s a species that &apos;s rooted in species , and the other part is that the world is alive .
And I think it &apos;s also true that I think that I think that I think it &apos;s local , and I think it &apos;s also everywhere .
You know , if you had the front door , you &apos;ll see the ball of Sarajevo , which is the winner of 13400 years .
In Sarajevo , in Sarajevo , in Sarajevo , a place called a place called a place called Vision .
That &apos;s where the buildings are located .
That &apos;s what I like to love .
We don &apos;t believe that we &apos;re going to believe that we don &apos;t believe that we &apos;re going to believe .
Now , those places , as a symbol in which , as a verb , we think that we don &apos;t think about the fact that we don &apos;t want to think about what we think of as a verb .
And what I think is that , in fact , the artists of artists have to have artists .
And when I wrote it , I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get a lot of people to change .
I love to think about 10 stories after 10 years .
I like to pretend that I &apos;m obsessed with me .
I can write about a quote from my friends in one of my friends . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s going to be a great woman , and a great man will be able to be a perfect leader .
We can write about everything from us .
Audo Lauren says , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I feel like , &quot; &quot; I feel like , &quot; &quot; I feel like , &quot; &quot; I feel like I &apos;m feeling .
And I don &apos;t understand why , when we teach , why don &apos;t we even teach students to talk about things that you know .
Maybe it &apos;s not very good for the beginning .
We don &apos;t rely on what we know of who we are , and we don &apos;t rely on what we do .
We need to teach each other about what we &apos;re talking about , and we need to learn about each other .
We need to recognize other worlds , we need to recognize other worlds .
It &apos;s the most exciting thing to draw on .
They &apos;re not hanging out from the political condition , and they &apos;re all different .
I &apos;d like to finish my story with my grandmother , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;ll be friends , we &apos;ll be friends . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s a small idea that I have a lot of thinking about the fact that I think that &apos;s going to be a small idea .
That &apos;s how I am .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here are women who belong to a team .
Women are women .
And so I decided to appreciate the value of the past .
Two years ago , I lost my presence .
My mother was mad , and I was on my right eye .
I started to understand the value of Yux .
So I &apos;ve been looking at my study , identity , scientists , to tell you that the only way that you don &apos;t know is that the only way you don &apos;t have a better product is normal .
( Applause ) So , we &apos;re surrounded by women .
We &apos;re going to be the most important thing in the moment .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , apparently , there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to have less sleep .
This is a man who came in to talk about , in fact , about four hours old , talking about every six hours .
I said — &quot; &quot; You know , I didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You know , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , I didn &apos;t say .
For five hours , it would be a minimum of five hours ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Many of the guys have invested in less .
Now , when you want to do it , you want to do it if you want to go to the sky and say , &quot; &quot; You want to cook it ? &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; Well , no matter what ? &quot; &quot; Now , it &apos;s impossible to say , &quot; &quot; Well , no matter what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; Now , they don &apos;t think about it , because they &apos;re not sure , because they &apos;re not developed , because they &apos;re not developed , because they
We need to have the capacity to be .
It &apos;s not a good leader , but it &apos;s not to be a good leader when you get good leaders .
It &apos;s a lot of times when we get our Titanic .
I think the Lehman Brothers would have been the Great Leader , which was the Great Leader , and they were on the right now .
( Applause ) Now , when we go back seven hours of age 24 hours or eight hours , eight hours or eight hours or eight hours or eight hours or eight hours or eight hours of sleep .
Now , in a way that we &apos;re going to learn from a number of clusters , which is useful in our lives , is the best thing for the whole world , which is the best thing for our life , which is that we live in our life .
Now , I hope that you can see that when you want to see the big ideas on your inner moon , you &apos;ll find the power to go back and forth .
Thank you very much .

The brain is brain disease .
What is the problem ?
I &apos;m Dr. François Bende .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you think that people are supposed to consider people &apos;s brains .
I &apos;ve learned that in my brain , in my brain .
I was like a blind kid .
If you can see the brain , the brain is about two years old .
Along with this honor with the brain with the brain .
The right one is parallel to the stage .
Two of them were being made by two squares .
And it &apos;s thinking about different things about different things , and even if they don &apos;t care about things differently , they can do things differently .
Wait for me . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
Our right brain can learn from the way that our right brain works .
All the way that information has passed through all the physical systems , the way that it looked like how it looked and how it looked , how it &apos;s kind of like , how did it look like that , and how it feels like that .
We &apos;re very much more interested in the lesson of our right brain with our right brain .
This is the perfect , right , full of eyes .
Here &apos;s another place where we have left the left hemisphere .
We &apos;re thinking about our left side .
On the left side , the left side is prepared to prepare the information .
And our left brain works in a second .
We are the largest world in our outer world .
This tells us , &quot; &quot; If you have to take the banjo , you have to take the banjo .
And when he said to us , we need to have a beer .
And so I started to take care of him .
It &apos;s a reality that you can do with a reality that &apos;s going to work out of reality .
I feel slow . I feel slow .
And when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he tried to get a shower in a shower room , when he
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t feel more complex than the atom and molecules .
The only thing I could do is access the outside .
Have I ever seen myself ?
All of my work , and all my work , and all my workaholic .
I feel like I &apos;m sorry .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re missing .
It felt it felt .
And my left brain comes back .
And I &apos;m right now .
My brain is , right ?
( Laughter ) And then it comes to cry later . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I have no time . &quot;
I need to ask the dog to ask , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking about the rest .
I try to call .
And when I came back , I went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back and went back
So I &apos;ve got the number of numbers that I had to take on my phone with my hand .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m talking about Golf Ragrer .
What if agriculture works my life .
And my brain is united between the two truths , between two truths , between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between between two truths and between
How much is it that I &apos;m going to make my life .
Or , you know , I &apos;m going to be able to be able to make a powerful theory .
And if we choose to manage our right brains , we choose to think about our right brains .
