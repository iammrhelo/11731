( Arabic ) I think I think I &apos;m careful on , the bad guys said , &quot; &quot; I love you . &quot;
( Music ) I grew up in a middle class .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but when I was born , he was a business man .
If their children were children or girls , they were going to go to school .
So I suppose I was fortunate .
My mother was born 16 times .
Of the 16 , we are living five .
You can imagine what I had to do when I was a kid .
They were being carried out by the Taliban being carried by their spouse , or children being brought to a cup .
In that moment , when I finished high school , I wanted to be a doctor .
It meant to be a kid for women and children .
So I explained my education , I want to go to college .
She passed , in my country , there was no women for women in the present for us , even though I had been treated at the time of medicine , couldn &apos;t go .
As a consequence , my father sent me to America .
Vice for America .
Remote my studies .
As I finished my education , I had chosen to have my country .
You know ? When I was ending my time , strangers had what was happening to my family and my country .
Six months later , and I had no news .
My family was looking at a camp camp .
So instead I finished the studies , I took my family to America .
I wanted that they were safe .
But what was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I listened to the news , when I was still in my country , I was grateful .
I wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
It was a college teacher .
She was fine .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
It could be living with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back to my own .
So I went to the camp camp .
And when I got to the field of mega-life , there were seven million and a half million of it . Seven million years old .
They did , black than 90 percent were women and children , and most of the men or they were killed in war or were on it . And they know ?
when they were done , I came up with things that they don &apos;t imagine .
It &apos;s a widow for five and eight children , sitting there , crying , don &apos;t know what to do .
I was looking at a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , no studies , no grade , or a place in what living .
They have kids who lose their parents , their lives and the ones that with 10 or sweet years , they had to take their families , be the head of family and try to protect their bees , their peers and the children .
The situation was absolutely sad .
My heart came from my people and didn &apos;t know what to do .
In that moment , I was a pulse .
In that moment , I would sit there , who can do these people ?
How can I help them ?
They are a person who can do for them ?
But at the moment , I knew that education has changed my life .
It turned out to me . I slow down a position .
It brought me trust . It offers me a career .
I gave myself to take my family on my family , taking my family to another country , so they were safe .
And at that moment I knew that what I was going to have to offer my people was education and health and that was what I tried to get .
But what do they think was easy ?
Well , not , because of that , women had no access to education .
Besides , after the Carking in Afghanistan , the people had no longer trusted anyone .
It was very difficult to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who are I ?
Somebody who comes from the United States .
Somebody who gets there .
They were in me ? Of course .
So what really needed was win the trust of this community .
How do I do it ?
I went , documenting me and I watched .
I asked questions .
In the end , I found a man .
I was 80 .
It was a horse .
I went to his tent on the balcony and I drove the proposition , &quot; I want to become a teacher . &quot;
And looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; Hey , crazy , how do I think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ll tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be a teacher . &quot; &quot; Eventually , he had taken my supply , and how I started with a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of like I started with the voice .
Instead of a year , we had 25 school schools , 155,000 children at school , and it was unbelievable .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
And of course , we were doing our work , forming teachers . It belongs to human rights , human rights , democracy and laws .
One day , I was in the office in the office , and one day , I was in the office in the summer , and one day , I was in the office in the cave in the hills .
So , suddenly I saw that all of my personal DNA was , and suddenly I saw that all of my personal personal DNA , and suddenly I saw that all of my personal DNA was going to be like ?
You have fear . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know , your life is game .
But as leader , you have to keep your posture .
You have to keep your posture and show it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people say , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot;
So I invited to walk in the office .
They lived . They were nine , nine Taliban .
These were the most awful men you can see .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) People with the wrong question , black clothes , black wind , black wind , and drove mass in my office .
And they invited me to sit and take a cat .
They didn &apos;t have to take it .
And of course , the ton of the voice that they were using it , and I was really connected .
But at the same time , I kept myself .
And of course , at this point , you &apos;ve seen as a little bit of a black black hole .
The only one that I saw was the eyes .
Ask me , what do you do ?
&quot; Do you don &apos;t know that the school is going to stop women ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , you know , and you know , and you know , what school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; This school is the house of someone . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This school is the house of someone .
See , some students . They all learned the Koran , the sacred book .
You know ? The Koran says that if you studied the sacred book for women can be good wives and they can do their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I asked them one thing : That &apos;s how it comes with that people . ( Laughter ) In that moment , they &apos;re just talking about it .
They talked about them and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to leave it , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; Then I offer them , and they would offer them again and they would take it .
So my personal aunt came to my office .
They were scared of fear .
They didn &apos;t know why they won me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me with them .
With all , all of these were joyful .
Very happy and of course , I was happy to be happy .
( Laughter ) Of course , it &apos;s funny to be alive .
But also , by taking action when the rains come through the middle of the middle , when the Taliban had the power of it .
We were in the hills , and we were teaching 80 young students , three thousand students lonely , we were able to <unk> ate .
I went out of the stairs , we went through the country and we opened a school after another .
We opened education centers .
We opened clinics without stop .
We worked with women and children .
It acts on safe health .
You can &apos;t imagine how many kinds of goals can &apos;t imagine .
I was very happy . I was lovely with the result of my work .
And one day , when I went to four educators and a spear , I took my back to Kabul , suddenly once again , I had worked on the middle of the road , did the 19th room .
With them on the valley , blocking the road .
I would ask my driver who happen and I responded to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
What would you like ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; they said
In that moment , women dropped inside the car .
I &apos;m very connected and I say , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
This time , it &apos;s killing everybody .
He had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , it gets the forces of everything you do and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You can &apos;t follow yourself and you can follow so much .
So I &apos;m interested in a car side .
My leg was coming out of the car .
Ask them , &quot; &quot; How can I help you ? &quot; &quot; You know what to answer me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it &apos;s going .
Come on every day of a place .
It &apos;s the women , and they will also give them the opportunity to have a job .
Do you yearn . What about you , what about you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And what about the press ?
What we &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
What we know , the only one we can do , for time in the time in the living , is to fight a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . &quot; &quot; And you know what it means .
Obviously , it was an oven .
Then I went away and said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go . &quot; &quot; And I went to the car , and I said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go back , &quot; &quot; and I told the driver , and I said the driver , and I said to the driver , &quot; &quot; and then I said to the driver , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go back .
We just had money to teach them for them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all the educators left .
They &apos;re going to get their houses . No .
My aunt was the only one I was there , and I had had no voice .
I was connected , sitting in my desk , and I said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
Because we offer education education in the north .
Hundreds of women came up for us to teach them .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly , now , now , we &apos;re talking about pulses , because at that moment , one of my amazing favorite , I had asked me .
And I call it , &quot; &quot; Hmm . &quot; &quot; And I answered .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you ask ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
It was equal to say that , I didn &apos;t believe and still asking .
&quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
I told the story .
Then she said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , you &apos;re going to get them to them .
They inform them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I did the same way , know what ? They weren &apos;t there , they were a little bit further , the same kids , there was foot on the edge and time and time to stop the car .
So I stopped the car .
I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I . &quot; &quot;
So it took me to the mosque and to summarize , tell them they &apos;re going to do .
Now they &apos;re the best educators .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , learn computer devices and are my .
And all the areas that we don &apos;t yet know , in the mountain , they come with me . They go . They go .
And stimulate .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
So that the education changes people .
When you raise people , they change and , in fact , we need equality .
You can &apos;t raise the women and forget the men , because men are the people who engage in more difficult women .
( Laughter ) So we start to educate them , because they can be aware of the potential of the women , knowing how much of the women can &apos;t have men and those women can &apos;t get their jobs they have them .
So we form men continuously , and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and I think profoundly and
I live in a country that live in a country that &apos;s beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful and peaceful country .
We give all the parts .
Women have studied education , engineering , engineering , profession , profession .
We don &apos;t close the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out without security .
But we don &apos;t want Afghanistan .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now the women of Afghanistan are very , very hard .
Thank you . Fartis .
They &apos;ve studied to be terminal again again .
They study to be profession and testing business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how individuals are using all its potential and all this will happen .
I want to share with you for love with love , through compassion and honesty .
If you have these things , you succeed .
We have a poet , Ma<unk> , Si<unk> .
He said if you have compassion and if you have love it , you can get the world .
And I asked them , we were .
And if we were in Afghanistan , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that any can be able to do it all over the world .
Thank you , many , many .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So , I was a shot at Harvard University University in Los Angeles , L.A. .
When I was calling it was a <unk> iton of Zo Bay .
In a local local cell , it is prelimining a facial player and the tangles that it was a stroke .
You would ask me if I could go to the zoo for looking for something possible .
It will prevent clear that the zoo of the United States are now linked and highly varied and highly identical that care of their patients .
But sometimes , you &apos;re going to look at the medical community , especially for some specialized designs , especially for some integrated community .
It could do the way to do the brain &apos;s brain in the case of this chimpanzees , and I &apos;ve been able to share that the harards of this marine marine Resources wasn &apos;t there . This is this photo , I &apos;ve been able to get the heart of a little bit of a little bit of <unk> ors , and the doctors that we &apos;re going to bring up 700 rubs of national <unk> ons and clinicians on what it &apos;s worth their heart .
And this way I &apos;ve ever done , that I &apos;ve ever done in many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that glue and of this glue .
Learning symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients ; for their patients .
And when instead , at the same day , he &apos;s going to go on the Medical Center in the Medical Center in Los Angeles .
And I started seeing clearly one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I began to see one thing : &quot; And I started seeing one thing : &quot; And
So , the doctors and the improvers who are the same diseases in their human patients and animals , and animals , they are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do these humans and animals , and animals , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who , who ,
Well , I have to give them fun .
But even as I studied physiology and evolutionary biology during the university — even I &apos;ve done my graduate thesis about Darwin , learn more about meaningful and human beings was a very necessary touch for me .
And I started asking myself how could it be , with all those topics , who never asked me and opinion to a company or a Parkinson &apos;s , to have to have to have any kind of perspective on one of my human patients ?
Do we have ever ever at a conference ?
Even more , why should I be surprised for granted ?
All doctors accept as a few biological connections between animals and human beings .
All the drugs that we prescribe , that we have so that we have to give our families in a animal .
But there &apos;s a lot of difference between giving an animal a drug or a drug or a human human brain , and that animal develops for itself , and that animal develops cancer .
Maybe it &apos;s part of the surprise of the world that our world are between the city and not urban .
We &apos;ve heard about those universities that think that the Army grow up in the trees or the cheese comes from a plant .
Natural hospitals today are starting to transform more and more than a lot more than a <unk> er .
And this creates a psychological range between the human patients that are there are treated and the animals that live in the ocean , in the city and the <unk> les .
But I think there &apos;s a deeper reason right : I think there &apos;s a deeper reason .
And the doctors and the scientists that we have , the doctors , the doctors , the doctors , is only a kind of more , not only anything else .
But in our inside we don &apos;t end .
I &apos;m going to tell myself that when I fell to Beethoven or I can see my Macenned photos that did Marks .
I feel that called the human nature , and I feel that it &apos;s called the <unk> ality of the human body as a species , the part .
Well , it &apos;s a little bit like this .
Now , when I see a human patient , I always ask myself , &quot; What do you know about the animals that I don &apos;t know ?
How could I do better to my human patient if the target and how a human animal ?
And I &apos;ve seen some examples of the connections that gave me this kind of success .
It &apos;s induced heart heart .
So there &apos;s a year in the year 2000 , the human heart of humans .
It was described in a happy father by the game that he lost the savings of all the lives of the entire life , in a bride drop in front of the altar .
But it turns out that this new &quot; &quot; novel , &quot; &quot; or it was new and human rights .
The <unk> ers already took me to be diagnosed with when I was trying , and even though they had even been emotionally emotionally abused symptoms , from monkeys to the 1970s .
How many of human lives could be saved if this <unk> tering knowledge of the emergency patient and the mast ?
Ausely .
Some human patients themselves .
They were like that .
Some patients are also suffering themselves .
There are no bites that they &apos;re going on and again .
But the <unk> ers have very specific forms of treating them , and we don &apos;t prevent them as they behaved like this .
It wasn &apos;t supposed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be aware of the person &apos;s therapists ?
They gave birth and psychosis .
Sometimes by giving birth to some women in depression , sometimes in severe depression , and still in international states .
They can prescribe their own son , and in fact , they get to the hills .
The World Wide Web know you know when you ever got out of it , and it &apos;s a little bit after the time , it can be <unk> ecting his prayer , and if some cases , maybe it &apos;s going to be .
But the largest itudinal workers have a treatment to address this bunch of different religions from the Hirshhorn .
oxytocin is the foundation of <unk> ation , and it causes the water that it takes for an interest in their own .
I wasn &apos;t supposed to be this information at the exine and inrespectful , of the family , and the patients that are going to get rid of them and the <unk> s ?
Now , despite the fact that it &apos;s all this , the distance between our own is being great .
To explain it , a lot of time I &apos;m going to have to put some of you in evidence .
There are doctors who can be authentic as they &apos;re not aware of them .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;ve chosen and psychologists , and psychologists , but especially to the atrocities .
Of course , most doctors have no idea that it &apos;s more difficult to go to today at the time at the time in a medical school , and when we go to school we &apos;ve learned all of what is relevant to know about a species , Homo sapiens . But the <unk> ers will learn about health and diseases of mammals , sharks and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the <unk> <unk> as well as well with their progeny of my profession .
So here &apos;s a joke from the World Bank : How do you call a <unk> ate that only knows a species ?
From 2003 to this distance , it became my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through the lab as Darwin on the Andes , where we invited the experts in animals and biologists , and we &apos;ve been doing it as we &apos;ve invited our blood cells from our internal and residents .
And through the San Diego Mountains , where we invited the progression of their medical courses and Valilia to keep focusing on the diseases and their disorders .
In the San Diego Station , the participants learned how the treatment of a cancer cancer cancer could help address the cancer cancer &apos;s brain education , and how to understand a little bit of the stress of a child &apos;s child &apos;s child ; how to understand the sheep of the stress of the state of a child &apos;s child can help to help the treatment as a anxious kid .
In the San Francisco Museum , first in America , and now all over the world , and now all over the world , doctors and <unk> ers leave their own , and they &apos;ve looked like it , as the doctors .
In the end of all , humans are also suffering , and it &apos;s time for us , and it &apos;s time for us , doctors , and we connect to the World Wide Web .
Because it turns out that some of the best and more social media are being done by the doctors who have patients who are not human .
And one of the best ways of treating the human patient is a lot of attention to how every other patients on the planet live , they are growing and they are .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; Uny hero !
( Applause ) To the brain &apos;s brain was , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine , , as you can imagine ,
I didn &apos;t know anything about it .
In the oc<unk> culture , when you have a computer , it &apos;s when you get the rest of it .
Life is a complex human , it &apos;s replaced by medical medical medical , and the computer test , the list of the lab , the list of social media .
Suddenly in a Parkinson &apos;s disease .
Doctors start talking a language that you don &apos;t understand .
And I ask my hand my body &apos;s finger and your own X-rays .
People start changing because they start to deal with the disease rather than the person .
You ask , &quot; &quot; What do you tell you the doctor ? &quot; &quot; Before I say &quot; &quot; Ola . &quot; &quot; As much as I say &quot; &quot; Ola . &quot; &quot; As much as I say &quot; &quot; Ola . &quot;
Do you ask the kind of &quot; &quot; Am I ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m who who &apos;s working with adoption ?
Will they study ? Do you ask love ? &quot; &quot; What is creative ?
Do I ask you , &quot; &quot; What did I do for you to buy this ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can change something in my life ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s something I can do ?
There are some other option ? &quot; &quot; And of course , the doctors are the good guys in all of these cases , because they &apos;re very professional and committed with art .
But they &apos;re also very used to deal with patients , so I would say that sometimes they love the perspective of it for you , and you see , literally , in a patient . &quot; &quot; Science means &quot; &quot; what they expect . &quot;
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is that you have to engage in any way in knowing your family and friends or teach you some ways to modify your life than you &apos;re going to do .
But with all of them , I &apos;m going to take the hands in the hands of a lot of people &apos;s very professional .
As I was in the hospital , I asked them to be able to look at the Pharaoh .
It was really hard to get it , because it &apos;s not a lot of fun to ask a photo of yours .
I talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , you don &apos;t represent me .
I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , it is , will have faced all of my self . &quot; &quot; So the next day I went from the wrong hospital .
I was decided to change my relationship with the car and I was decided to learn more about him before doing something as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , use a lot of sorts of technology to open open code and information .
So my big bet was spreading all , because it &apos;s all a way that any one could see her .
So I &apos;ve created a web site called &quot; &quot; La Cide , &quot; &quot; which , &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; which , &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; which , &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; which , &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; which , &quot; &quot; La Cw
Actually , I had to save them , but that we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;ve been this word , &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; because in the Italian means &quot; &quot; La Cw , &quot; &quot; because in a lot of different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; Star &quot; &quot; can have many things .
In our Western culture , it means to be to erase the disease , but in other cultures like for example , from the Mediterranean , of American countries or Africa , it can represent a lot of other things .
Of course I was interested in the medical community and the rest of the health of health professionals , but also I was interested in the rating agency by the poet , the poet , who , who , not by the musicians .
I &apos;m interested in social media , and I &apos;m interested in a psychological basis , and I &apos;m interested in the spiritual community , interested in the emotional emotional , interested in all sorts of people .
And it worked .
The place &quot; &quot; La Cide came back to the world .
I &apos;ve had a lot of attention paying attention from Italy , and the rest of the world and over 5,000 people contacted me in a lot of time through emails , social networks — most of these were passive drivers like healing , but many more were about as I am .
For example , I &apos;ve had thousands of thousands of videos , images , photos and art of art .
We have to come up here and we have to do it .
Or what he did the artist Patrick Losty : Eb or an eye sculpture in 3D , and she woke up to the Great Bear .
Now you can also have my bra !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s great , you can actually share the same outcome .
And this was what was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , various researchers , doctors — they were all connected to me .
With all of this information and support , I &apos;ve been able to come together with a team of neurosurgeon , traditional physicians , colon and various hundreds of volunteers that I &apos;ve been able to talk about information that I could talk about information that I would take , which is very important .
Together , we were able to make a strategy of my own tie into different languages and as different cultures .
So the strategy was currently slowing around the whole world and thousands of years of human history , something that I find pretty special is .
( Applause )
So I could take my time to pick up .
I &apos;ve been the physician with what I wanted to work , and I had the hospital in what I wanted to be , and every while thousands of people were interested in being pity without me .
All the world felt that it could be usefulness to help me , and this was the most important part of La Cide .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m well like you can see , well .
( Applause ) I &apos;ve been great news for my surgery : I have — I have — I had — I had — I had — I was — I was — I was a lot of very low .
I kept my life completely and my lifestyle .
I was very intense , I had an electrode from connected to my brain on this side on this side , to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the risk that I was going to run and if there was some of them like avoiding .
Obviously .
This kind of fun was the true of La Cide .
These people share their stories , their experiences .
Doctors have been talking about people that normally haven &apos;t seen when it comes from .
I went to myself , I &apos;m still in a continuous state of translation between a lot of different languages , where science has found with emotion and conventional research with the traditional .
&#91; SOIIY &#93; The key point of La Cide was thought of as part of a truly committed society and connected by global well-being depends on each of their individuals .
This global self is my heart to open open .

I have no idea what we &apos;re going to touch .
I can &apos;t tell you what .
I didn &apos;t realize that there was no music .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I heard .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , before nothing , it &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s like nothing , you know , in the scene , you and Christian Sands on the piano . ( Applause )
The baton , as we call it , is an incredible space .
It &apos;s a sacred place .
And one of the things that made sacred sacred is that it doesn &apos;t give us the opportunity to think about the future , or in the past .
It &apos;s really alive right now .
There are so many choices when one is going to smoke .
We had no idea what we would play .
So half a song , we did an email from a song called &quot; &quot; T&quot; &quot; ABo Bo . &quot; &quot; But that could happen or not .
Everybody heard . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for the exact ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about the error else .
The way I &apos;m in a mistake when I &apos;m in Hawaii , before nothing , we don &apos;t see as a mistake .
The only mistake I love you who are not able to understand that it &apos;s what other did .
Every error is an opportunity on the jazz .
Even it is hard to describe what it would be a fun note .
For example , if I paint a color , as if I &apos;m playing with it , there &apos;s sonar like this .
( Music ) If Christian hits a bill — like Funt . ( Music )
You see , it &apos;s all linked to the flow of colors .
If it comes up .
You see , all of you see in this inner emotional correctness that we are painting .
You know , if you touch the # DR # ups ) most of you have heard a mistake .
You see , we &apos;re going to play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to touch this cup .
In a moment , Christian , they added this bill .
And we don &apos;t react to it .
She &apos;s going to touch a second , and then I &apos;m going to stop and speak a moment .
Let &apos;s see it &apos;s what happens when you touch this cup .
( Music ) Congratulations , someone could understand it as a mistake .
I would just say it &apos;s a mistake if you don &apos;t respond to it .
A lost opportunity .
So it &apos;s very clear . Let &apos;s paint this back again .
He &apos;s going to touch . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to react , but something .
Let &apos;s take their ideas , or not .
( Music ) Did you see his bill .
And I grew up one day .
This time the texture has changed .
It was a bit more rhythmic , a little bit more difficult to my answer .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is whether they &apos;re not conscious , if every musician is not conscious , and don &apos;t recognize their peers to incorporate the idea and we &apos;re not going to allow creativity .
This is actually unbelievable .
It &apos;s an inverted experience .
And I know I speak for everybody when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that being able to rise to the prognosis and to make music is a prophecy .
What do you have to see this with the engineering ?
We are all the jazz musicians , our stereotypes is not the most appropriate for the purposes .
( Laughter ) I just wanted to show how we face it .
And the other dynamic is that we don &apos;t do it .
There are people who do it .
But that &apos;s just an art chance .
If you look at the band that you love this and I want to do it , and I say to you , and I say to you .
And it turns out something .
One , two , three , four , four , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit chaotic because I &apos;m involved in ideas .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll go on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want to leave music , the better I can do is listen to .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It &apos;s more than seeing what I can do with what I can do .
If I want music to a certain level of age , the first step for me is to be patient , listen to what happens and to take something out of what happens to me .
When you do , you &apos;re eating and inspired to the other musicians and they give you more , and it &apos;s going to do it .
See , one , two , three , three , four , four , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely different when I shot my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has a lot more faint .
It &apos;s not to spread my vision .
She &apos;s going to be at the moment , taking care of each other and letting it go to creativity .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to be sincere , so these amazing talks and ideas that are being exposed to , I &apos;m going to be exposed to what I &apos;m going to show you , and I &apos;m going to tell you I &apos;m going to show you .
Everybody sees television .
I love you . I love you some aspects .
There are people in America .
The media that a teacher sees television is about five hours a day .
Right ?
Anonymous I live on television , so that for me , it &apos;s something .
But the lot of people don &apos;t like .
They did , in fact , in fact , in fact .
It &apos;s pointless , and things worse , believe me .
My mother , when I was a little girl , called &quot; &quot; the box &quot; &quot; box . &quot; &quot; My intent today is not in the good television or television ; my idea today is to tell you that I think television has consciousness .
If I think television has consciousness , it &apos;s because I think television reflects directly , social policies and emotional correctness has been focused on our foundation — television is how we actually have all of our values .
All of that is dry to humans and it &apos;s the idea of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk good or bad .
We talk about popular television television .
We talk about ten programs with more audiences for a $ 50s .
So as that index is not just what you heard , which is the idea of our social unconscious and the collective , if you haven &apos;t , like those 10 programs in 100,000 years reflect the idea of our social consciousness ?
How do we evolve television over time , and what do this point is our society ?
So at the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , if you care that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four basic instincts .
All of it , relationships , power , power , and the wish of it .
As humans , what we have to remember is that we have evolved , evolved with time , we &apos;ve evolved with these basic animals .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel like , compassion .
This is not like this in the animal kingdom .
The other unexpected thing , human beings is that we love it .
I &apos;m McKenna watching television .
This is something that we all separately from the animal world .
As the animals can play , but they don &apos;t .
So I urge you to discover what you understand from this hierarchy of human television shows and human consciousness .
Why is it wrong ?
Now , often like the cartoons of the ambulance and the CDC sitting in our shoulder .
The television acts like our consciousness , why do we teach us and why do we do it at the same time ?
To start to challenge these questions , we did research research research .
Step 50 years old , I woke up in 1953 60 .
We were on the top 20 of the audience that happened for 50 years — thousands of shows .
We talk with 3,000 people nearly 3600 , between the 1870s , and we asked how they were emotionally emotionally .
How many of you have ever seen one of these programs ?
Do you have a moral face ?
Will I get rid of it ?
What meant for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean that this took the cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotional age are universal .
And second , 80 percent of the most popular shows of the United States exhaled if the rest of the world .
I want to tell you that our audiences become identified .
I want to give you a lot of the two people before the first slide : Why do I really inspired how to think about consciousness and <unk> ens that consciousness can be in the day day , by the day , by the time , by Jack Stern , Jack Stern .
And by the way I &apos;m going to follow the data , I want to give a thank you by reknown to Bob Hans Rosling , who came to see .
Well , we go back .
So here you see , from 1960 in 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
There are two things that we &apos;re going to begin to start the state of an amazing thing and the state of the very moral age , which , for this study , we define concepts like television shows me , who make me feel better about the world .
The moral age are moral rules that don &apos;t buy the difference between good and bad .
By the beginning , you see that in 1960 , the original mantra .
So we see television .
The moral self starts to go back .
It includes the end of the 60 , the very moral age increases , and the unexpected thing .
Why ?
And the way of the <unk> ens of Cuba , the murder and JFK , movement by civil rights , are racial , the Vietnam War , the Stasi &apos;s war , the Ainact of Martha , and Bobby Kennedy .
See what happens .
In 1970 , the ultimate tore up .
The very moral self doesn &apos;t take .
They are , more Ronald Reagan , Ronald Reagan , it &apos;s in control .
Try to raise the flight .
But look , it can &apos;t be , &quot; &quot; On the Against Canyon , the disaster of C<unk> er , Chernobyl .
The moral self becomes very dominant , until the next 20 years .
Let &apos;s take a look at this .
This chart takes a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the joy of it — the social comment in blue and green and green .
In that time on television we have &quot; &quot; Bono , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; Shady &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; Hell &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and national programs that reflect happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase . The joy of it all .
And the crux of it starts to rise .
With the social trend increases .
We get 1969 and look at what happens .
The happiness , the Empire , and the social media , not only fighting our society , but they have two shows , &quot; &quot; Gelitke &quot; &quot; which in 1969 are number two and number three .
What was the number one one ?
Now , &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; &quot; and I use Martin . &quot; &quot; And the A.I. was Martin .
They all cooperate together .
The viewers responded in spectacular form .
Let &apos;s look at this green peak in 1966 , a bureaucracy .
When you listen to the term , &quot; &quot; Why do you want to look like ?
I mean , at the time I graduated from 1966 , the &quot; &quot; Svalbard , &quot; &quot; breaking out .
This was the first program that allows to viewers say , &quot; &quot; My god , I can comment on what I think of the Vietnam War , about the president , through television , through television .
Well , at the same time in the last chart , what happens .
In 1970 in 1970 , the title blew it .
We don &apos;t see television paying attention .
The social decision and the freezer on the 70 .
Now look at this .
How would I cut the 70s ? Norman Lewis .
We have &quot; &quot; Wilford , &quot; &quot; Sanford , &quot; &quot; Sanford , &quot; &quot; and the main program on the top 10 to the 70s — &quot; MAS . &quot;
In the 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs have been left during the Vietnam War , five of the $ 10 programs .
Just a generation , for 20 years , and we discovered , Is it going to do that ?
Will I feel that ?
Can you change ?
The audience as I knew , I want to tell you that the digital people didn &apos;t invent the trouble .
Archie Belker was pushed out of his own papers together with the rest of us .
This is another chart . With other variation : ghosting and imagination , which are defined as a lot of everyday reality , and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to feel better . &quot; &quot; What do they do in front of the red reality and &quot; &quot; makes me better feel better . &quot;
You will find that every time it &apos;s explosions and imagination goes to a <unk> <unk> .
Do we want to see shows people about saving money and at the train ?
Not . In the 17th century , we have the &quot; &quot; The beep of the beep &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; man , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The man of Charlie . &quot; &quot; The peak of Charlie .
What was those programs ?
Very rich and rich .
&quot; &quot; E &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> y Island .
A lot of it shows you from our national psyche with fast fast and tough : the train .
Now , my favorite chart , because these are the last 20 years .
You know , or not in my aunt , I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard about it , but I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard about it .
As we say this , the X would say , the X is going to be .
Ninety , the decade of humor , you guys like &quot; &quot; Friends &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Fager &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; L<unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , and it &apos;s okay .
But look , the X will place .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , the mood in the judgment .
Why don &apos;t it ?
We had the presidential 2000s in the Sutima .
The blew out of the needle .
The September of September .
So the <unk> <unk> has been controlled part of the social lexicon .
I mentioned what happens to time .
In the switch of the century , the surface of the Internet , the frozen reality .
What does people want people on their TV ?
I would think it &apos;s going to win it .
Give me happiness , my world are down down .
No , they want to judge .
I can get out of the island outside of the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin .
I can choose the new triumph . They &apos;re crushed .
Great , right ?
So to radically different things that are these ones , from pure entertainment , were there for 50 years , that was what I said at the beginning ?
We are animals , we need our peers .
There wasn &apos;t a decade of television and the very bad mother .
In the mid- &apos; 70s , I &apos;m going to see in the coma , &quot; &quot; Le<unk> . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Le<unk> is &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve done it through the aura of consciousness of social consciousness .
Former Chady , the archetype of the 1970s , the archetype of the 1970s , the archetype of the 1870s , the archetype of the 1970s , the archetype of the 1970s .
In the 1980s , it came to the first &quot; &quot; harsington &quot; &quot; in the form of Alexis Carlia .
Hony Brown faced with a mayor when they came up with the idea of being mother mother .
The mother of this era , Behind me .
I don &apos;t know if it comes from one or an expert in front of your consciousness , and you will not know if you love this picture .
So all of you , women and men at TEDsters , the audiences of TEDRights , thank you for letting me make my sense of consciousness consciousness .
But also I &apos;m going to give me a lot of the assumptions that if I put in the morning to the sea in our screens over these years .
Dan his life on television , safer , but you like spectating , through the collective social social social social social conversations , and you can &apos;t .
So thank you very much .

In 1994 , I went into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a nine-year-old who was tortured and what they were doing with a lawyer .
And by looking at the eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that had written in the politicians , never to write any letter to it , because it wasn &apos;t a 12 years ago that made something important for someone .
It wasn &apos;t a politician .
She was an 12 year-old kid .
What I have also told me was that it wasn &apos;t only in Cambodia , but that &apos;s the age of 1313 developing countries that they &apos;ve misunderstood , 93 of these different countries that are killed right now to a lawyer and the right to not be tortured .
And I realized that there was an amazing opportunity for opportunities for all of us as a global community for all of us as a global health method .
Now , a lot of people think about torture as a way of politics or that is reserved as only for the worse but by fact , 95 percent of the beasts that day are not for politicians .
They are for people who have been nervous systems , and unfortunately , we actually have to innovate is the most low-cost way to have a sustainable court system , cheaper than having a lawyer or get away from a lawyer , so it &apos;s what happens most of the time .
The day today , it &apos;s possible for us to be possible for us as a global community , if we take that decision , and end with the torture of the research method for our life , but this will take three things .
First of all comes back , the power of power and the connection of the world scale .
The second is to ensure that there &apos;s a different access to the state .
And third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started asking me , and if we were ready ?
Could we do something for those 93 countries ?
And I started to the United States , which has such as a specific mission to end with consumers like research research method and turn into practice <unk> ations in these 93 countries , in these 93 countries , a very early stage and in courts .
And yet , my first experiences came out of Cambodia , and my first visit of my first visit , when there was , in 1994 , in 1994 , in 1994 , in 1994 , even less than 10 bites in the country because the Kmer got killed .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 suns in the country , and so much , in a prison wasn &apos;t only caught up with a 17-year-old 12 years ago , but that you &apos;ve got to have women and asking you , &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ll take it from 10 years because my husband committed to me , but it &apos;s a place where not existed .
The first group of defensions came together , and I still remember , while I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for researching ? &quot;
And the living room in silence , and finally , a woman stood up , and he said &quot; &quot; K<unk> . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; K<unk> . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; I have to have it more than a lot of people and I have ever had to do no research , because they all came together with convicted . &quot; &quot; And we talk about , as a kind of kind of like a lot of people , and I had to do that , as a
And these kinds of actions had to come from value to decide that they would start advocating and support between them to make these laws .
And I don &apos;t remember the first case where they came up , and the 25 together , she &apos;s standing up and the rest behind them , and they thought , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re doing things in the same way that we have done to date . &quot; &quot; But one day , the perfect case , it was a woman who was convicted of a house that I was sitting outside of a house .
She told me that she &apos;d seen the person out of the person going to run and thought that they were looking like a lot , but the police came out , but she wasn &apos;t there .
So she was embarrassed . She was walking from cigarettes . She had a abortion .
And when they took their case in a court , for the first time this stopped and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , no longer there are no more except for the animant and so it will be free in freedom . &quot; &quot; And their actions have begun to take cases again , and the actions they have started taking cases of history .
But there &apos;s no sounds .
I was thinking , then , is just in Cambodia ?
Or does it happen in other countries ?
But what happens in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But it happens in so many countries — — ( Laughter ) But it happens in so many countries — — ( Laughter ) But it happens in so many countries — — ( Laughter ) But it happens in so many countries — — ( Laughter ) But it happens in so many countries — — ( Laughter ) But it happens in so many countries — — ( Laughter ) But it happens in so many countries — ( Laughter ) But it &apos;s so many
And I went into a prison and a prison and had no 12 years old , but a kid in eight years that had a cell phone phone phone .
Or a woman , I was married to her baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is as beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here for her , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m born there , but I was in prison .
And when I went through the conductor of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to leave it in freedom .
A Nobel laureates would leave her free . &quot; &quot; And he responded to me , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can tell it , but looking at my prison . The 80 percent of the two people here here are no bites . What can we do that ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers have begun to organize a system where they could get cases .
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t just the <unk> er of <unk> er , but the connection of it that I hit the difference .
For example , in Cambodia , what happened was that , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I
I mean we can &apos;t help to create fairness , and I said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to do not help to create fairness , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources has never been excuses for the resources . &quot; &quot; And with it , I want you to know that the lack of resources that we &apos;ve been able to get out of them .
So all the solution that we &apos;ve found was that we &apos;ve figured out , and then the solution that we &apos;ve found was that the solution that we &apos;ve found was the background , and then the solution that we &apos;ve found was that the solution that we &apos;ve found was that the solution that we &apos;ve found was the background , and then the solution that we &apos;ve found was that the solution that we &apos;ve found was that the solution that we &apos;ve found was the background , and then the solution that we found was
Almost recently , I was in Hawaii , and I decided to get this out with another group of avords . What they told me was that they said , &quot; &quot; Look , now we don &apos;t have the police in the streets , and the police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . &quot; &quot; Now , I said , &quot; &quot; But there are fewer tens of millions of dollars recently in the development of the court system .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I mean , what &apos;s going to do it ? &quot; &quot; I mean , what &apos;s going to do with it ? &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s going to do is it &apos;s normal , instead of suffering .
They showed me a manual textbook that was great .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to copy it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m listening to it . &quot; &quot; It was perfect .
The tax were perfectly formed .
But I told them , &quot; &quot; I just have a question . Before that all came back to the tax , what happened with them as ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , I said , &quot; &quot; Torths . &quot;
And by the way the key is not just not just the <unk> er , but to find a way to go to you , systematically yourself in the system for people who &apos;s being granted in the system for people who &apos;s being tortured to be tortured .
And while I &apos;m going to tell you this , they &apos;re also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , seems as if I could do , but we can do this in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it seems a huge thing .
And they are a lot of reasons why I believe it is possible .
The first of them is that people on the woods have found a lot of ways to make miracles .
And not only is Hingtable , who I was talking about C<unk> et , but also terrorism all around the world that they &apos;re looking at .
We have a program called the Makard , and we realized that there were drowning people and I wanted to help , but how could we support them ?
It &apos;s only a contest where you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to have some idea of taking you to fairness .
And there are 30 Minters in the world , from Sri Lanka to Swahili every day or the Democratic Democratic Republic of Congo , who with five thousand dollars do something unbelievable , by the engineering shows and any way that they find .
And there &apos;s not only these Sikers , but there are also people who understand what their contacts are , and how they can move them .
For example , in China , in China , the laws that the cops were able to prescribe people who were suffering .
And while I was sitting together with one of our ears , I said , &quot; &quot; How can we spread it ? How can we make sure that this if you can &apos;t do it ?
This is fantastic . And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot;
I &apos;ve talked about the fact that we need to form and supporting the defenceptors .
We need to educate ourselves in practical ways to function .
But third and final point , is that we commit this .
And usually people said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very good , but it &apos;s not too alien .
And the reason why I consider this opinion is interesting , and the reason why I consider this opinion is interesting , because that &apos;s exactly the same point that if you &apos;ve decided to end the slavery or defeating apartheid .
It starts with a small group of people who decided to engage .
One of our favorite poems of Islam , which they share among themselves , is , &quot; &quot; Al Gore , friends , the way it takes it to be long , the pathway is not clear , and there &apos;s a lot of game , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m safe for that , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not .
And I always know , because I know that the question will be , and it will be a person talking about you guys , but I can do it really , &quot; But first of you would say you know what you can do . &quot; &quot; And secondly , it would leave you with the story of the book , which was done was my reflection to actually set up the story of my cousin .
A few years ago when I met it . Naking was in a conservative prison camp . But as it was born in prison , they all had a little spiritual prison in the Atlantic Ocean , but they were born in prison , so they were the only one I could go out and get out of the brake .
And of course , as you know , there is rebate . And for the time when it &apos;s been growing , it &apos;s what it also grows ? The head .
What he was doing was just pass through the first step , and the second one , and then the third one , and then , very quickly , I moved my head to power through , and I &apos;m going to see her delight , because what he wanted to do every day was going to go back to me .
Of course , I could never get to visit the whole world every day every day , but I wanted to visit all the 156 of all the 156 ceremony .
Or if they were dark , it was like iron , and they turned their fingers through .
And most of the imprisoned , claimed that it was his greatest letab and his sun , and I &apos;ve always been looking guilty , and I thought , here &apos;s a couple of years ago .
In a prison with nothing without anything , no materials , but with a sense of their own biological journey , that in my opinion we were born in one , and I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t do it .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I will do the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I won &apos;t give you to the prophecy of a new world with all of us separately , and I have to make this journey to us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Give a talk for TED . &quot;
&quot; Dear a story of childhood . &quot;
&quot; Dear a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; Rematar with an idea called the action . &quot;
Not .
It &apos;s not like this to think of a TED .
In fact , if you &apos;re going to be too much these devices , you look at a clip or an emotional track .
But there &apos;s one thing that all of the great TED Talks have in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because you hear a lot of great good artist , like these .
You could get rid of the audience of the audience , and I learned directly on the secrets of a great talk .
And even though these are actors and their subjects look completely different , everyone has an common ingredient .
And it &apos;s like this : The main task as an actor is transfer to transfer the mind of who you listen to you , a stranger and beautiful object that we call idea .
Let me explain you .
This is Hrosy .
It &apos;s a point of giving a TED Talk and frankly , frankly .
( Video ) Music : Hrosty Van Dycock !
( Applause ) One 200 people , a lot of the ones that have never seen before they feel that their brains are synchronizing with the brain &apos;s brain .
They are literally beginning to ex<unk> yourself the same patterns .
And I don &apos;t just want to say that they &apos;re hoping for themselves .
We &apos;re going to take a look at the brain &apos;s brain .
There are millions of interconnected neurons .
But here , right here : a few million are connected to each way that represents a simple idea .
inside the whole audience of the audience .
That &apos;s like this ; just a couple of minutes , a pattern that affects millions of neurons in prison , only with people heard a voice and look at a face .
But I think it &apos;s an idea ?
Well , you can imagine that as a pattern of information that helps us understand and navigate the world .
The ideas come from a lot of forms and a lot of different forms from complex and analog and analog and analog to simple and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and analog and
There &apos;s a couple of different examples from the TED stage .
Sir Ken Robinson is the key to the future of our children .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robbie : What do I do is that creativity now is that creativity now , and we have been fascinated with the same status .
Chris Anderson : You know Hardy Hardy is beautiful .
( Video ) So Hardy Hardy : I call it around us , it &apos;s strong , compassionate to the grave .
CA : There &apos;s Adib Adie , it &apos;s more than a simple identity .
Video ) ( Music ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) So the simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they &apos;re false .
CA : Your mind reens , and you don &apos;t pay randomly .
They are very connected .
Exectively , it &apos;s an amazing structure that is your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like browsing by the world .
And it takes millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a little component of your view of the world is the idea that the blood vessels are horrible , then in the green , you &apos;ll see it .
But if another component of your view of the world is the idea that the atheists are dangerous , then in green , you &apos;ll get a bit different .
So it &apos;s pretty obvious that the ideas that are going to be in your view is crucial .
You need it to be the most powerful thing that it is possible , and it &apos;s wonderful world .
Now , different people in the world can be very different .
For example , as responds to your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Mohep : What do you do when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman who , &quot; &quot; an ambulance , &quot; &quot; an ambulance , even for &quot; &quot; an artist ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
Or &quot; &quot; Hey , &quot; &quot; with the wash brain , &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; a terrorist ?
CA : Whatever the answer , there are millions of people out there that would be very different .
If you look at the right way , they &apos;re able to change , forever , the way that someone sees the world and transform their actions as much as in the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that affects human culture .
So if you accept that your main task as a good thing is to build an idea in your audiences , there are four items to address that task : First , just to your talk to a single idea .
Now , ideas are complex things ; you need to attach content to be focused on a simple picture that I have the opportunity to explain it .
You have to give context , sharing examples , do it .
So it &apos;s a sense that it &apos;s an idea that you have to lose your talk , so that all you care about your talk , so that all of you care about them .
Second , let &apos;s tell you how to listen to you .
Before I start building things in the audience in your audience , you have to have your gift to it .
And what is the tool to do that ?
Curiosity .
Bears curious curiosity .
We &apos;re using some intrigued questions , we &apos;ve been faced to identify what something doesn &apos;t matter and accurate .
If you can show a disconnect from the world of someone , you will be going to be able to fill that portion of knowledge .
And when it &apos;s like that wish is much easier to start to build the idea .
Third , it &apos;s a piece of what it looks like , which is the piece of concepts that your audience knows .
It use the power of language to weave together concepts that exist in the mind of who you have in mind but not in your language , in your language .
It starts where they are .
Trasactors often often have a lot of people and concepts that they love them are completely blind for their audiences .
Well , the <unk> ens play an crucial role to show how they fit the bits , because it &apos;s the way that the way they &apos;re successful , is based on a idea that you listen to .
For example , when Jennifer Kechel did explain this incredible biotech biotech called CRISPR , it said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like , for the first time , you &apos;d have a process of text .
The PS allows you to cut and take information into a very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a graphic explanation like this offer a big moment of achievement while fits in your mind .
It &apos;s important , so I &apos;m going to try to talk to the talk with friends of trust , and see that parts find more intrigued .
Look , here &apos;s the final thing to do : make your ideas deserve to be sharing .
With this , I mean that you make this question : Who benefits this idea ?
And I need to take honest with the answer .
If the idea only you benefit to you and your organization , then I feel , probably not worth worth being shared .
The audience will see through you .
But if you believe that the idea has the potential to do the day someone or changing the perspective of someone else &apos;s perspective or to inspire someone to do things else , then you have the crucial ingredient to a good talk of truth , one that can be a gift to them and all of us .
Only 25 percent of what we heard .
And I realized that I would hear every day I &apos;d realized that I &apos;d soon realized that I would probably realized that I would hear every day I &apos;d realized that I would hear every day I &apos;d realized that I would hear every day .
( Laughter ) ( Ruends ) With this little bit , it &apos;s still difficult to listen to you .
And the art of conversation conversation is the art of conversation and the art of conversation .
A world where we don &apos;t listen to each other .
And to rebrate the ear , to revening the ear and recalibrate the ear heard of the ear and recalibrate the ear &apos;s ear ear .
It &apos;s understanding the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my favorite .
You see , you see , the ordinary sounds can be very interesting if you put attention .
What is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine that you &apos;re in a street of any place of America and I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Sorry and ... &quot; &quot; This is the Oak Street , it &apos;s the Oak Street .
This is the street floor , that 27 . &quot; &quot; He said this : &quot; &quot; All right . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; Dit : &quot; &quot; Well , apples have names .
The streets have names , the apples are only in the way between the streets . &quot; &quot; Now , the great audio , a little confuse and decree .
Now , imagine that you &apos;re a wheelchair or a place of Japan , the person who you have on the side and ask questions : &quot; Sorry , what &apos;s called this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the stage 17 and that 16 . &quot; &quot; And say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this road ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t .
The apples .
Let &apos;s Google Maps here , and there &apos;s the 14th 14 , 15 , 16 , 1891 , 19 , 19 , 19 .
All those apples have names . The streets are only the ones that are not a name between apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know your home ? &quot; &quot; He said this : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is the cup of eight .
It &apos;s 17 , per number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , well . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , well . But walking through the course of the house , they &apos;re not going to do . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , you &apos;re going to do it .
The first home would build an apple is home .
The second home that has built is home number two .
The third is at three . It &apos;s easy . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . &quot; &quot; I love how many times we have to go on the other side of the world to give us the things that we &apos;ve ever achieved , and tell us that the opposite of them can also be true .
As for example , there are doctors in China that believe that their labor is staying .
So every month that you &apos;re healthy , you have to pay them , and when you get sick , you don &apos;t pay because you &apos;re being healthy , you &apos;re not sick .
( Applause ) We on music , we think , &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of the music sentence . One , two , three , four , four , four , three , four , four , four , three , four , four , four , three , four , four , four , three , four , four , four , three , four , four , four , three , four , four , four , three , four , four , four , three , four ,
But on the west west Africa , the &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , as the end at the end of the sentence .
So I can tell you not only in the same way , but in the way that I &apos;m going to say , two , three , four , four , four , four , four , one .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s one said that for any real thing to tell you about India , the opposite will be true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so at TED as somewhere else , that for any brilliant idea that we have or listen , the other can also be true .
They Doired owkita .
