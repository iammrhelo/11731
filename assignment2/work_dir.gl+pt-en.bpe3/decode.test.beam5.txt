She was a 2005 afternoon .
I worked as a scientist at the LULLY , the Union by Liberia .
I told myself my work , but that day I felt a little bit excited .
And so I explained to the rest of my fellow Chris Hanssen .
Chris took over 30 years of working at ALLLULULLULLU, which I &apos;d like to do with institutions .
I told Chris that I was sitting there .
I was researching a number of issues about the intersection of science and freedoms : a lot of interesting .
But I wanted to leave the United States , and I wanted to go to America , in a way that I could expect a difference .
Chris was going to go to the big and ask me , &quot; From all of these issues , what are the one you know ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the same of the genetics of genetics , the reproductive technologies .
Well , there &apos;s a great thing , the teacher &apos;s employment as a detector , and ...
Well , of course , the topic of the genetic patents . &quot; &quot; Are the difference ?
Yes , that is , of human genes .
&quot; No ! &quot;
Will I say , say , what the US government is in the human body ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; I went back to my release and I sent Chris three papers .
And 20 minutes later , it came to him taking care .
&quot; WO ! Did you have a reason ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s Chris is a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost anything about the patents of patents and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I know something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t bowling , but it wasn &apos;t forced to be a patent .
I wanted to clear that there was a lot of learning before she was .
First of all , we had to know exactly what it was when it was a gene .
The genetic patents used to raise a range of <unk> ences , but the most discussed all the so-called &quot; &quot; DNA &quot; &quot; or it is , a piece of DNA that I saw from a cell .
The actions of this say , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t spill the genes of your body , you see the sides of it . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , more radiation , that you need to transcend the genes to use them .
And the patents didn &apos;t walk into a particular gene , but all of the potential is changing in that gene .
What does this mean ?
Well , you can &apos;t pass your genes to a physician and say that the <unk> ter , to see if they have mutations , without the permission from the patent .
It also means that the prophecy of the patent has the right to stop that gene to stop it or clinical trials .
I explained that these headline , the kid companies , complete private companies , close parts of the human genome was to have patients .
Now , we have the case , a small 10 years with the QT , a heart disorder that , if it &apos;s not it , can cause a cardiac death .
The company that measured the two genes associated with this disorder could have been able to diagnose a game .
But then they went to the edge of course , and they &apos;ve never got the cell offer .
But the company that I would expect the patents threatened to the patent .
Two years without power to do it .
For that time , I called it &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t diagnose .
The genetic patents were a problem that has equal patients .
Do I have a way to get in front ?
Well , it turns out the Supreme Court stopped in a long list of earlier earlier , that there &apos;s a series of things that are not known .
You can &apos;t measure the nature of nature : the air , the water , the flow of the table .
Not neither of the nature of nature : the law of gravity , and Mary 2 .
They are very fundamental things , and they need to be the grasp of all the time , and they have to be at the grasp of all of them , and they have to be the grasp of all of them , and they have to be at the grasp of all of them .
In our opinion , the DNA structure of the most fundamental life , which encode the production of all of our proteins , is so much a product of nature like a law of nature , no matter how to find out and our bodies or on the bottom of a test .
For the best , we traveled all over the country to talk about a different country : scientists , professional medical professionals .
Most people told us we were right since a politician &apos;s point of view , and when less of you , from a legal standpoint .
They were all thought that the way to get out of our subject was so many of them .
But why ?
It turns out that the Minister of patents leads these patents over 20 years .
There were thousands of thousands of human genes .
The patents of patents was very attentive at the status quo of the biotech industry , the biotech of the biotech is growing around this practice , and the action is to provent the genetic patents .
Nine : the courts were not willing to be willing to fight these patents .
But I don &apos;t have to Chris and I fear the challenges , and that tells us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not enough &quot; &quot; to follow it .
So we started to our cause .
The curator of patents used to be : Anonymous , demand demand for some subject , dark and messy .
And we didn &apos;t have interested in that kind of causes , we think our causes a lot more .
It &apos;s the basis of the scientific freedom , the development physician and the rights of patients .
So we decided that we decided to open a cause that it wouldn &apos;t be like the usual , but one cause of the civil rights .
We &apos;re looking at identify a convergence of genetic patents that he had been advocating in their patents to organize a lot of genetic patents before and they were telling the courts like these patents , and they were telling the courts like these patents , and they were suffering .
We think the optimal candidate for it was Myzztics , a company with thirst in Salt Lake City , Ugh .
Welcome to the patents of two genes , the genes BRCA1 and BCA2 .
The women with certain mutations in these genes have more likely to defense cancer cancer and sheep .
The total opening on the TV test on the United States .
He did that a lot of it was that a lot of working on TV shows .
They were used by a lot of money by his test : 3,000 dollars .
They stopped sharing their own clinical medical community .
And if I look at the worst , for a period of a few years , Mygarlia was pasting his test so that they were able to identify by a team of researchers in France .
I moved to that period for a few years , until a 12 percent of the women that they have made the wrong answer : a negative outcome that should be positive .
This is Malleard Kaxsi .
Now , the Queen of Kata , Eileen , developed cancer , developed cancer with 40 years and ran exams .
The negative test .
The family has dropped .
The most likely cancer cancer wasn &apos;t present in the family , so the other members of the family didn &apos;t need to do the test .
More than two years later , the Kahard diagnosed with an advanced cancer cancer .
And it turns out that the &quot; &quot; Magic II &quot; &quot; found that 12 percent of people have written a false privilege .
If Eileen gets the right look at the right thing , Kathleaching his cancer , and avoid his cancer cancer .
I could get these issues .
Now , they &apos;re suffering , they organizations , the scientific organizations that set up the most of 150,000 scientists and professional men , individual women who or couldn &apos;t afford the exam , or they could do a second opinion that they couldn &apos;t afford to , because of the patents .
One of the major challenges that we faced when we prepare this case was to think about science .
Now , to argue that what I &apos;ve done Mydsad wasn &apos;t a good way , and that the genes of BRCA were out of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts like : What is a gene ? What is the DNA ?
How do you know the DNA , and why is that it &apos;s not a crack ?
We spend hours and hours and hours and experts , trying to deliver the way to explain these kind of simple ways .
And at the end of us , by the end of the vastness , like the gold .
So viewing DNA is like a gold range , or the river of a river .
You look at the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t measure the gold .
It &apos;s much how much work they &apos;re going to get to get the mountain of the mountain ; it &apos;s not pathetic . It &apos;s gold .
And the gold again , again , can we employ all sorts of things in the mountain that you couldn &apos;t use when it was in mountain ; he can do it , for example , but you can &apos;t measure the gold , because it &apos;s true .
In 2009 , we were listed to the case .
We &apos;ve been doing this in front of the U.S. district in New York Side , and the case there is no politely politely , or at the World Robert Kennedy Foundation .
From 2010 2010 , the Nobel laureates took his favorite lesson : 152 pages . One was complete for us .
When we read their opinion , I was focused on what I &apos;ve described the science in the case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could it be able to develop a fundamental knowledge of the subject in that time ?
We couldn &apos;t think of as wrong .
So it turned out that the city of what I was working on was , not only lawyer , was scientific .
And not only was scientific — I had a PhD PhD student .
( Laughter ) Thank you lucky !
And so we said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I want to stop the emergency department of the New York Times .
And there are things that they do .
First , in a vital moment of this case , the government of the United States changed .
In the district court court , government issued me a report to Delhi .
But in direct space to their own office office , government has a report to what he said that I had had this subject to the light of the district court court , and I realized that DNA wasn &apos;t supposed to be excluded .
This was very important , completely unexpected .
The Minister of the Federal Foreign Policy takes all cases of patents , and it &apos;s known as a lot of the patents .
So even with this particular event , we would count on losing lose .
And so it was .
More or less .
And the decision was for two .
But the two Nobel laureates who voted against us , did not do something completely different .
The first one , the Great Bear , invented his own own , completely wrong theory .
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
And I said , &quot; &quot; Why did I have no sense .
The other judge , the army Moore , said that they agree with ourselves as a product product .
But I don &apos;t want you to take the industry in the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , the Fyz Bryyam , gave us the reason .
I have to present a question that I &apos;m going to answer the Supreme Court .
Now , these questions go in the way of a few years long , a few years old , a lot of them with a lot of them , which just as &quot; &quot; chicken . &quot; &quot; Where is it .
We did that , and I was looking at a short question that I had ever had .
Five words : Are you gravity ?
When Chris asked what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think you would have to say , &quot; &quot; Is this a patent DNA ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want the rest of them , I want to get the same reaction that I &apos;ve had the day that I had to talk about this topic about seven years . &quot; &quot; And of course , I would like that I was going to tell me about this topic about seven years .
The Supreme Court was just sitting around one percent of the cases that I had , and I had to hear our own .
And it goes out the day of the allegations and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people out of the two : 30 of the morning to try to get to the two : 30 of the morning to try to get out of the stairs .
Two people were against cancer cancer , they organized one hand interrupts .
Chris and I took them together in the hall , moments before he gets to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he .
But all of that panic would be controlled if when I came into the room and I saw a lot of them , and I saw a lot of them , and I saw a lot of them : women who knew a lot of time in their very crowded work to make this fight , representatives that sacrificed a lot of time in their very crowded classes to make this fight to court .
In the room , they were three leaders of the Human Genome Project , including the co-mate of the DNA , James Watson , who had a report to the court , where they said that they would have genes for the court , where they would say that they would have genes that they were like a lot of what we had in game .
Curiosity was a shot .
Chris claimed a brilliant way .
But for me , I was looking at the Black Supreme Court in the Supreme Court trying to understand the DNA , through a series of analog analog donor and dialogues , as much as I &apos;ve done our legal team for the last seven years .
Now , the army KA associated with the motion of DNA with a mital plant .
The Nobel laureates associate him with a baseball glove from a tree .
And what no doubt was my favorite moment , the Black S<unk> ayed would determine something that DNA was waiting for . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we left that day from the stairs , we were very trusted , but when we left that day , we were very trusted .
A natural segment of DNA is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not supposed to be excluded as it &apos;s like .
And what &apos;s more , Mykin hasn &apos;t invented anything . &quot; &quot; Twenty and four hours after the decision , five percent announced that they would start to offer birth test to the BRCA .
Some of them would have promised to offer birth to the cheaper exams .
Some promised to offer a test , a double test with what I offer .
But the way of the court was going to end up again .
Remote with a 25 years that would allow you to do human genes in the United States .
You know , it &apos;s a strange that it &apos;s suffering and the biomedical research .
And they helped that they were like , &quot; &quot; I love it , and they were able to get access to exams that needed .
A few weeks later , the court emits his decision , I got a little shower in the inbox of the email .
I was to Bob CO , a teacher at the University of Duke University and one of the first people that I and Chris went and Chris went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and I went to visit , and
( Laughter ) We are very much with this case .
Part of what gave us to address those risks was to know that we were doing right right .
The process lasted almost eight years since the beginning to end , with many of us , with many of you and you saw the way .
Of course , lucky helped , but they were the communities that we &apos;re going to do , and the memory that we &apos;ve created , what gave us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Ola . Today , I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of eight of my projects , made by artist &apos;s artist &apos;s artist .
We &apos;re going to call it Porty and we live in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , what I call &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; phone . &quot; &quot; Inspired my very habit of my uncle told me that he does things for him , almost as if I was an extension of his body : turning the lights or taking a glass cup or a cup of candy or a cup cup .
When I grew up , the thing was the worst and eating it as a way of control .
Of course , I couldn &apos;t say nothing anymore , because the uncle is a really broken figure in the day .
What I was most mad and he was his use of the phone .
He could get the aura stopped and she took me to the number for him .
In response and as gift to my uncle , I was &quot; &quot; The phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they do have two people to use it .
That &apos;s exactly the way that my uncle uses a cell phone phone .
The problem is that , when I left home and I went to college , I began to go to the edge of less .
So I &apos;ve done a machine writing machine with what could give their commands to you and get rid of all the world through electronic emails .
What I had to do was take a paper , put the paper in the car , writing the email or command the paper .
This device would send you to the person in a way that &apos;s a letter .
So here you can see that we combine lots of chemicals that understand all the mechanical action , and we can see that we combine all of them .
So my uncle is only a mechanical interface .
And since then , the object has to be great and having a clicker touch , as well as my uncle died .
The next job is a sensitive device to the sound we call the &quot; &quot; P<unk> . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with it by being surrounded by ir<unk> , and we wanted to work with it .
This works like this , and we have these lines here on the wall and behind , we have these little creatures that fit it .
Instead we &apos;re going through silence .
And if there is more silence yet , it turns out .
And at the least , they act again .
So we have these fibs on three walls in a room .
And we &apos;ve had a couple of these little benefited from these little disadvantages .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a video prototype .
When there are silence , you walk away from the track , and when there are silence , you walk out of the edge of the screen .
And as humans or real creatures .
And they &apos;re aware of the sound that they &apos;re frightened of there .
Don &apos;t respond to the sound .
I &apos;m looking at a moment when they don &apos;t respond .
( Laughter ) But they respond to the sound at first plan , and I &apos;m hearing that in a second .
( Applause ) We &apos;ve worked very hard to make the most realistic asset .
Every host has its own behavior , the psyche of mood , personalities , etc .
This is a very premature prototype .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We &apos;ve done the people , but we saw that people were quite a child and child with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The Economist . &quot; &quot; We were pretty intrigued with the invisibility of invisibility .
How would it be possible to experience invisibility ?
We worked with a sacred company into surveillance cameras , and we gave them that built software with us using a camera that could look at people in the room , follow to this person and replace a person with the bottom line , and then you replace a person with the bottom , and then you replace a person with the bottom , and then you replace a person with the bottom line , and then you replace a person with the bottom line , and then you replace a person with the bottom , and then you
I &apos;m going to show you a very premature prototype .
On the right , you can see my colleague , who , in fact , is in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the processing video where the camera does .
I &apos;m going to walk into the fourth room . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s the visible .
You can see how the camera goes and the translator .
It &apos;s a premature video , so we don &apos;t see the entirety and all of that , but perfect breakthrough was rapidly .
This axis on a room where there was a camera looking at space and we had a monitor in every wall .
And second people went into the room , and they look at themselves in the monitor , except for a difference : a person &apos;s constantly unvisible place where you want to move into the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The sun of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , like an escape from a space of oil or a sun .
In front of this object , this object seems to be very strong and thick , almost looked very weak .
People would walk into the room , and almost ignore the room thinking that it was some kind of kind .
But rather than black , I would start to let the drill down the way .
They would go and get it forever .
( Laughter ) This work is a title of a gunshot .
Their head is as heavy , full thoughts , which seems to be like , and its body causes almost like a plant .
What does it do is move around your mind as if you were a loaded from a very efficient movement , and it &apos;s slow down .
It &apos;s like much for that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there , and the soil was very thin , and it was very cold , and it would start to get to get rid of it .
And there &apos;s no consumer .
Let me give you an example . When people come into the room , they &apos;re going on this object .
And it &apos;s very slowly , in a few minutes , and it turns out that it &apos;s the same point in fall .
This is an important moment because we wanted it to get a look at a kind of almost going and help or save the subject .
But I don &apos;t need it because it &apos;s even the way that it &apos;s again .
This work was a blueprint for us and we worked very hard , as most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanical mechanical piece .
It was very important for us to identify the exact moment in what I would see , because if we were to turn the balance , then they &apos;re going to go , and it wasn &apos;t enough , not enough , and that more likely to want to go to the help .
I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where you do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . Let me go .
And now it &apos;s taking nervous , so it &apos;s going to take it .
But it doesn &apos;t have to do it , because it can get it out .
This is a work that we &apos;ve been very intrigued , working with aesthetic aesthetic , working with thousands of thousands of little clusters of optics , which shine like the sky sky .
And it &apos;s the scale of the sky sky .
And we took it around a drop of a drop in a way that I was taken away from .
The idea was to hire something as cold , distant and abstraction as the universe with the family , which is very comforting and intimate .
Now , the idea was that somewhere you would have to look at the shape of a drop and almost the appearance as a hole in space , as if you &apos;re looking at a brilliant sky .
This is the last job , still in a process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; Imagine a lot of the paper in front of you in the room in the room , and there &apos;s a lot of you here , you try to figure out how to have the room in the room , and that there &apos;s a little bit of it .
So this object is constant , and it &apos;s just to create a dynamic with people moving around , as if you try to hide a secret in their together or something like this .
We worked with a lot of technology , but in reality , we don &apos;t like it , because it &apos;s a lot of suffering in our work for years and years .
But we use it because we are interested in the way that helps us understand emotions and behavior in these creatures that we &apos;ve created .
When a creature comes to mind , and almost like the creation process is finding the way that this creature wants to be , that a creature wants to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start with with a little bit of the useful technology , and everything requires you , is this : you have to change for two minutes .
But before I get to tell you , I want to ask you now that you look at your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
Now , how many of you are in the way you get yourself ?
Alone , with my legs , the <unk> ds .
Sometimes you put arms like this .
Sometimes . ( Laughter ) I guess I see .
You can take attention to what you do right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this one , and I hope that if you learn to modify a little bit , you &apos;re going to consider the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re fascinated with the body language and every few years , especially other people &apos;s language .
You know , every few years — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) — a nice interaction , a smile looking at , or even something like a cup of hands .
Narrator : So here are coming to 10 .
This police is lucky and gave the hand to the President of the United States .
There &apos;s the first Minister — not . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Amy Cheldy : One of the course of hands , or his skirt , you can give us what a few weeks and weeks .
And even the BBC &apos;s New York Times .
So when we think about it , not verbal language or body language , we call it not verbal .
When we talk about communication .
What do you communicate your body language ?
What do I love my next ?
There are reasons to believe that it &apos;s true .
Sociologists spend a lot of time or other people , talking about others .
We make dec<unk> and disseminate body language .
And right now , they can &apos;t predict important projections in life like whom we hire or promote or whom we ask them to ask them .
For example , I was Amnery , researcher at the University of Marriage Act , shown that when someone sees 30 seconds of video games are no human interactions with real human interactions of the gay physician , if that physician is going to have stopped or not .
So you don &apos;t have to see so much with the physician or not incompetent but with it like that person or it .
Even more dramatic , Alex Tomyv , Alex Totiv , showed us that the Black Goals of political candidates inspired by a second 70 percent of the new political candidates of the face of the face of the face of the face of art , and even at the Senate , and even at the bottom of the government , and even at the bottom of the United States , the impact of the government , they can drive the most worth of it .
If you do a bad use of them is bad idea , no ?
Much of language is not verbal to talk about how we &apos;re looking at others , how we &apos;re looking at ourselves and what are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other audiences in which it affects our verbal language , which is ourselves .
It affects our language not verbal language , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
What language is not verbal ?
They are social psychologist , and I &apos;ve been teaching each other and I teach myself in a business school , so that it was inevitable that I was interested in the dynamics of power .
It helped me all over all of them , not verbal power .
What are the mismismissions for power and traits ?
Well , it &apos;s this .
In the animal kingdom , you have to see the expansion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see the expansion , and in the animal kingdom have to look at it , in the animal kingdom .
And with this big , they &apos;re going to be able to get space , and they &apos;re going to stop space , and then it &apos;s going to be space , it &apos;s basically opened space .
It &apos;s opened .
And it acts like this .
It &apos;s not just just the prime of you .
The humans do the same . ( Laughter ) You know , you have power in a constant fashion and also when you feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because it shows us the ancient and universal ones that are these misguided .
This speech , I called it , was studied by Antonio Banderas , and this speech was studied by Antonio Banderas .
which tells us that the people who are being blind , they have to tell us that so much people that are blind , they are doing the same when they win a physics competition .
So when you &apos;re looking at the edge of the goal and win doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;ve never seen anyone else .
They go like this .
The arms ran on , the cheese is high .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We do just the opposite .
We &apos;re going to go . We &apos;ve gone .
We do small .
We don &apos;t want to travel with who is at our edge .
And as human animals like humans do .
And this is what happens when you get to be able to get it .
What we tend to do is we tend to do when it comes to the power of it .
So if someone gets very powerful with us , we tend to make them much more .
We do the opposite .
If I see this behavior in class , what do you see ?
And the students &apos; students have contributed all the language of power .
Now , there are people who are Svalbard in the classroom , entering the classroom , and they &apos;re going on in the middle , as if they wanted to take space .
When they sit , they seem to spread .
They go to the hand .
And then there are other people who come up to be pretty close .
He sees his face and his body , and his body would sit on the chair and says , and they do so when he stood up .
So here &apos;s two things .
I don &apos;t bother you .
You have to see sex .
Women are more likely to do it that men .
Women are always powerful with men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I &apos;ve noticed is that it seems to be linked to the record of the students and the level of it .
And this is very important at the class of MBA , because it counts for the media of the bill .
Today , business schools have been struggling with sex .
These women and men and men , and then you see these differences in the notes , which they look like being attributed to it .
And then I started asking myself , if there are people who come up with that attitude and participating in the brain , and I started asking myself , if there are people who come with that attitude and participating in the country .
What would that lead to participate would be possible to do that other and what would do that drive to participate ?
My collaborator Dana Carney Carney , who is in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can do it .
I mean , you can do it just for a moment and experience a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language not verbal language , and they think there &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question was , what &apos;s the question that we feel and we think about ourselves ?
There are evidence that this is .
For example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but we also have to laugh at a pasting with this , they make them feel happy .
It works on two direct pods .
When it comes to power , it also works in two direct pods .
When we feel powerful is more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we pretend to be powerful is more likely to be powerful that we really feel powerful .
Well the second question actually was , well , we know that the mind gets our body , but it &apos;s true how the body gets your mind ?
And when I say mind , in the case of the powerful , I &apos;m talking about ?
Now talk of thoughts and feelings and feelings of physiology that make these thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about hormones .
How is the mind of powerful people who aren &apos;t ?
The powerful people tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s much more confident , more optimistic .
They have the feeling that they &apos;re going to be able to get really cool games .
I also tend to think about a more abstract way .
There &apos;s a lot of difference . It &apos;s more risks .
There &apos;s a bunch of difference between powerful and those who aren &apos;t .
It also means that if there are differences in two key hormones : testosterone , which is the hormone of the master , and the <unk> ol , which is the hormone of stress .
Young males with a lot of power in the Koran would have high levels of testosterone and lower lower levels , and the powerful leaders and efficient efficient .
What does this mean ? By talking about power , I was used to talk about testosterone , because I had to see with the master .
But the power also has to do with our reaction .
We want a dominant leader with a lot of power , but we want to stress ?
Probably not , right ?
We want a person who is powerful , and the dominant but not sensitive to stress , a person who is quiet .
We know that in the Koran would be to take control , if someone has to take control , if someone has to take control , take away from that paper from a days , his testosterone to a lot of time , his testosterone to a lot of time .
We have that evidence , that the body can fit in the mind , at least the facial level , and also the range of paper can be tied to mind .
So what happens when a role of paper ? What happens if you do a much level like this little , how little do this little track or editing ?
He said , &quot; &quot; I want you to go , &quot; &quot; I want you to get the most powerful thing . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided that people in the lab and to do a small experiment , these people adopted , for two minutes , both of them , and I &apos;m going to show you just five of them , and I &apos;m going to show you just five of these little little bit .
This is one .
A couple more beers a couple more match a couple more match .
The media call &quot; &quot; MulMulson &quot; &quot; .
So here we have a couple more .
You can stand up , or sitting .
So here are the fact that they &apos;re suffering .
You know , they &apos;re small .
This is very low power .
When you look at the imperfections , you really see .
This is what happens .
They came up with in a jar , and they told them for two minutes : &quot; &quot; You have to do this or what . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the rebellion .
We don &apos;t want it .
We want them to feel power .
They have this two minutes .
So we asked , &quot; &quot; How powerful you might feel ? &quot; &quot; So we gave them the opportunity to bet , and we gave them the opportunity to bet , at the end we take it out .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experiment .
This is what we found .
Lots of at risk , to bet ; we find that when they are in a high power position if you &apos;re going to bet the 86 percent .
When they are in the low power , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve found with testosterone .
It &apos;s on their normal normal situation to get , the powerful people , an increase in the 20 percent of the top 20 percent .
Again , two minutes , and they offer these changes .
Now the results on the bottom .
The most powerful experience for a 25 percent decrease , the most benefited by each other of the 15 percent .
Only two minutes would have these hormone-like change that you &apos;ve set your brain to do it , secure or uncomfortable , or whatever stress , or whatever , or whatever .
We all know that feeling , right ?
So there &apos;s a lot of our language that our language doesn &apos;t bother to ourselves , not only to others , but not only for ourselves .
The body can change the mind .
So the next question , of course , is — can a power of power in a few minutes ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , are only two minutes .
Where can you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what matters .
We think where you need to stay in what they &apos;re going to be in where they were in the social bonds , and we think where they are in the city where they &apos;re in .
They were like your friends .
For teens is at the dining table .
For some people is talking to the school school .
It could be like a business or a talk or give a talk like this or going to a job interview .
So we took one of the most powerful people in the most extraordinary people , because many of them did for her , the interview interview .
So we did the results , the media was interested in and said , well , this is what to do when you go to an interview , not ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) God &apos;s kind of horrible , and we said , no , no , not what we wanted to say .
For a lot of reasons , no .
Again , it &apos;s not about talking other people .
I &apos;m talking with you .
What do you do before going to a job interview ?
You &apos;re sitting there . There &apos;s your iPhone — or your Android — we &apos;re not going to leave anyone outside .
You &apos;re going to get your text messages , you &apos;re going to get a small little bit , when you really do what you should be doing is this , maybe at the bottom , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s right ? I &apos;ll see two minutes .
That &apos;s what we want to grade , right ?
We invited people to the lab , and adopted high-figuration and adopted again , they have an interview interview at the lab .
Five minutes later . &quot; &quot; He filmed me .
Also , they &apos;re looking for donations , and the rest of them are responsible for it to don &apos;t react to it .
Imagine that this person you interview .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than interacting .
People were doing this .
That &apos;s what Marianne Sar<unk> is called &quot; &quot; being at the social norms . &quot; &quot; So it goes on the garden .
This is the interview that we took , because we wanted to see what happened .
You have analysts , four in total .
They didn &apos;t know at the chance .
They don &apos;t have any idea that in order to get each person and at the end of looking at all of them , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people &quot; &quot; all of them .
We don &apos;t want to hire other .
We do a lot more positive habit . &quot; &quot; What was going on ?
It &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
This is the presence of the presence that came through the speech .
Why do we evaluate all those variant variant to cooperate : Are we very good for the speech ?
Does they stay well ? What ratings do you have ?
These things don &apos;t affect . This and what affects them .
This kind of stuff .
Every person &apos;s worth itself , basically .
They are what they &apos;re .
They are their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what makes it easier to do .
When I talk about this , that our body changes our mind changing our mind and behavior can change our way to be , say , &quot; &quot; It looks like . &quot; &quot; Usi ?
I &apos;m going to ask you , you know , to the ice .
I &apos;m not like this .
I don &apos;t want to get out there and feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like this .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an expert and thinking if I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
When I was 19 , I was a terrible car accident .
I took fired from it , and I found a lot about his shovel .
I was fired from the car .
I hoped in the intensive care with a blade in the head , and I told me from the university , and I was told I was going to have a couple different pattern .
I met my ChaI. because they were used as a forger , and I consider a little bit .
So I went from college and I tried to go back .
They told me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you laugh at me .
You have to accept that there are other things that you can do , but in your case this is not . &quot; &quot; I had to deal with that , and I have to say that you will take your identity , which really is the most powerful thing you can do , you know , that for me , it &apos;s the most powerful thing you can do .
I felt absolutely powerful .
And so I worked and I worked , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I worked .
Eventually I graduated from college .
I was four years older with my colleagues , and I was able to convince someone , my prayers of the Antarctic , Susan Fiske , so I realized I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The night before I graduated from the course of the course of the course of the exhibition , I was at the bottom of the course of the exhibition .
That &apos;s like this .
I was so afraid of the worm coming out of the next day that I was calling , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll leave it . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t let me leave you , because I put it out there .
And this is what you &apos;re going to do .
They &apos;re going to do every node they give you .
It &apos;s just going to do it , and to do and do it . Even if they &apos;re frightened or even stop and having a experience of <unk> tic experience , until you &apos;re going to be able to do the moment that the &quot; &quot; Arvin , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s the moment .
I came up to here . I &apos;m doing it now , and that &apos;s what I did .
Five years of high school , a few years old , you know , at the United States , I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m not thinking about it but for a lot of time I had the feeling that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The end of my first year at Harvard , a student that I didn &apos;t talk about all of the ages , what they did , &quot; &quot; Look , you have to participate , you have to participate , you have to join me . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know before .
Totally defeated , said , &quot; &quot; I wasn &apos;t there . &quot;
That &apos;s my moment .
Because it turns out two things .
The first one I told me , &quot; &quot; No . I don &apos;t feel like this .
I didn &apos;t sit it like this , but she and I can see it in his place .
The second era , of course , is there !
Let &apos;s go , which can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , of course . Yes to you . &quot;
I &apos;m going to thank you , you &apos;re going to make you powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) coming out of the class , and you know what — ( Applause ends ) See , I &apos;m going to give you the best speech of everyone . &quot; &quot; And you know , I didn &apos;t even know if I sat there . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve been a few months later , and I said , I didn &apos;t even know if I sat there .
In order to change .
Now I want to tell you that there is no mistake to do it .
There &apos;s a lot of fun to move .
So there &apos;s that enough to be able to be able to move and heal .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
Little change can lead to the great force .
I &apos;m just two minutes .
Before we &apos;re faced to the next few days , we &apos;re trying to look at the next few minutes , and I &apos;ve tried this , in the room , in the fourth room , in front of the door .
This is what you have to do .
You can see the brain to get the best of this situation .
It &apos;s 27 . It &apos;s going to go up the hill .
They didn &apos;t look like that in this way that I didn &apos;t show them .
It &apos;s from that feeling that I &apos;m going to say who they are , and I &apos;m going to make it prove .
I want to ask you before nothing you adopt a power position , and I also want to invite you to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to tell you , let &apos;s show you the people , because the best can use it , because the best can use it to be those no resources or technology , without authority .
I &apos;m going to do it with them because they can do it in private .
They only need their body , privacy and two minutes to change the projections of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s a good option .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to talk about what are the big problems in the world ?
And I should say , before I continue to go , I &apos;m going to ask you every one of you that you &apos;ve had <unk> z and paper because I &apos;m going to ask you to do how do we help you see how we do it .
So the laser <unk> z and paper .
And finally , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world .
I &apos;m going to ask you a few .
800 million people pass around .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to it .
Two billion without sanitation .
Many people are born HIV and AIDS .
Things themselves .
Two billion people who are really super concerned about climate change .
We have a lot of problems there .
In a blind world , we all do all , but we don &apos;t .
The truth is that we haven &apos;t done all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question I think we should do — and that is the reason why we don &apos;t do it all , we really have to start asking ourselves , what problems should we be doing first ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we have to say , 50 billion dollars to spend the next four years to improve this world , what we were going to spend ?
We &apos;ve sequenced 10 of the most big challenges of the world , and just the rest of it , and just the rest of it , and just the rest of it . Yes . &quot; &quot; Yes , we &apos;re all aware of financial agents , and the financial care , education and corrupt , movements , sanitation , sanitation and water .
We think these , in many ways , look at the world &apos;s world .
So , the question I would look like , what do you think are the biggest ?
Why should we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking you about a bad problem .
Actually , that was the cool thing that I talked about in D<unk> .
But I &apos;m a problem here , there &apos;s a problem if you ask people to focus on issues .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
So the biggest of the problems we have in the world is that we all have in the world that we all have in the world is that everybody died .
But we don &apos;t have technology to solve that , we have ?
So the problem is not to do the problems , because the problem is not necessarily the solutions to the problems .
And I &apos;d like — naturally that if you make a bit more complicated .
For changing climate change , it would be something like Kytuoia .
For example , they could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
For the world , it would be the forces of peace of the U.N. , and so we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to ask you to ask you to do , and that in 30 seconds — and I know that some way is something impossible — you know what you do , you know , you think , you &apos;re going to be a lot .
And also — it &apos;s naturally , naturally , where the economy goes down , and it &apos;s just like you weren &apos;t going to do it .
What should I be at the end of the list ?
Please , only 30 seconds , perhaps about 30 seconds , perhaps some of you are talking with people , and just imagine what it should be the primary priorities and the least benefited from the solutions that we have for the world .
The surprising of this process — of course , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to tell you , I have 18 minutes to tell you a big amount of time in my time , no ?
I &apos;d like to tell you , and I have to think about this process , and that &apos;s what we really did .
And I also recommend that , and I &apos;m sure we will have these discussed , and I &apos;m sure we will also have these discussed , and to think , how do we do it really ?
Since then , there is to ask the same , why have never done a list like this before ?
And a reason is that the aspiration is in<unk> ous .
No one wants to do .
Of course , all of the organizations wanted to be at the bottom of a list like that .
But also all the organized <unk> ons would have not been in the highest .
And there &apos;s a lot more numbers there . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s a lot more numbers like this .
60 years ago there is 60 years ago there &apos;s the U.N. , and it &apos;s still not having a basic list of the big things that we can do in the world , and say , what would we do ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t listen to them — every moment is an insight , so that we all know it &apos;s not as much as we really did — and that is not as good as if we really did it , and that is not as good as if we really did it , and we &apos;re going to be able to talk .
So what I &apos;m going to propose is to say we had , for a long period of time , a situation where there were multiple options .
There &apos;s a lot , many things we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices anymore .
We had no idea .
Imagine that you walk into a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the prices are .
You know , you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a wheelchair , they could be able to be 1,000 dollars .
It was a familiar pizza . It could be an individual pizza , no ?
I want to know these things .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s dealing with to make the sense of &quot; &quot; Bull &quot; &quot; — it &apos;s to put the prices of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of the sense of Co<unk> .
We have 30 of the best economists in the world , three of each area .
And so we &apos;ve had three of the best economists on the planet , writing about climate change .
What can we do , what can we do ? What will we do it ? &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s good to do ?
The same with innocent illness .
Three of the best guests , what can we do ?
What is the price ?
What would we do to do about that , and what would look like ?
And so anyway .
So we took some of the best economists , eight of the best economists in the world , including three Nobel laureates , put it in Cap<unk> in May in May of 2004 .
And we call it the &quot; &quot; give &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; The mayor of the University of Cambridge decided we decided to leave them the Royal Minister of the economy .
It works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And then what made it done , it was a little list .
And then you ask you , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m so happy that I &apos;ve done that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a good question .
The theme is that , obviously , if you want to know malaria , you ask an expert on malaria .
If you want to know about climate , you ask a matologists .
But if you want to know what you want to know , you can &apos;t ask any of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
They act .
They &apos;re going to get it wrong to say , we have to do first , and we have to do it later .
So this is the list , and this is the list I want to share with you .
Now , of course , you can also see the web , and I &apos;m sure we will also be going to be able to talk about it .
He said , &quot; &quot; They have been committed to a list where they said they were bad projects — basically , projects where you have a wheelchair , and you &apos;re less less than a result .
They were the right projects , the good ones , the good ones .
And naturally , they &apos;re very good at the ones we &apos;re going to start to do .
I &apos;m going to start from the last way that we can end up with the best projects .
These were bad .
As you can see the end of the list is changing climate change .
And that &apos;s kind of a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people will say that I shouldn &apos;t go .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why arrived ?
And the truth , I will also try to talk about this , because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we don &apos;t agree with the tricks that you don &apos;t agree with .
The reason that it was that he said , this is that Kayry — or do something more than Kriyson — it &apos;s not a good reason because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It &apos;s not saying that there &apos;s no global warming .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do for it is very little , at a very high cost .
What we basically showed us , the media from all of the darkest models , and that Kyry , if all the world had agree , it would cost a few billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Two times the global help of the development that we love the Third World every year .
And to do it very little .
All models would show you that you get to get a couple years ago .
So one guy in Bangladesh that we have suffered from 226 can take 150 .
What &apos;s a good , but not good .
So the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something right .
And just by giving a refer , the U.N. estimates that half of that amount , 100 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the major problems in the world .
We could give clean water , sanitation , biologists and education all human beings on the planet .
So we were asking ourselves , we want to spend a lot of good ?
Or is half doing something very good ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out a bad project .
It &apos;s not saying that you have all the money in the world , you don &apos;t want to do it .
And I &apos;ve done that when we don &apos;t have it , just not our first priority .
The right projects — I &apos;m not going to comment on all of them — but even if it is , it &apos;s a basic health scale , a lot of basic services of health care , is a big thing .
It would be very well , but also , too , but it also tends to be .
Once again , what we all suddenly started to think about the other side of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , it shows a lot of projects of sanitation .
Once again , sanitation and water is inimportant , but it also costs a lot .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four pretty much priorities that I should be , when less , the first that we solve when we were going to solve the problems of the world .
The largest dimensional fourth fourth is malaria — treating malaria .
The malaria malaria is about a couple million people every year .
It could even produce a different point of GDP per year for cancer .
If we invest a $ 13 billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce the vastness .
We could prevent death from a couple of people , but the perhaps most important , we could prevent that billion people if infected each year .
And we &apos;d like it meant to be defined as their ability to treat many other issues that they have to deal with . Of course , in the long term , also <unk> ating with global warming .
The third is free .
Bestically , the model showed that if we could get the rest of it , and especially 60 of the current states and Europe , we could basically lift the global economy to the startling amount of people in the Third World .
Once again , we could actually take 200 or 300 million people from poverty , radically and very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third thing we could do .
The second thing is that it would be focused on <unk> tics .
It doesn &apos;t feed it in general , sentors , a very economic way of treating the nutrition , it &apos;s say , the lack of micro .
Thank you , the half of the population of the world has no iron , and the largest , yogurt , yogurt .
If we invest 12 billion dollars , we could make a profound benefit from this problem .
This would be the second best spark that we could do .
And the better project would be focused on HIV / AIDS .
Thank you , if you &apos;ve invested 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 million new HIV cases .
Again , what this makes , and what you focus is to say that you have two different forms of how to treat HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is marketing .
Once again , in a blind world , we do the two .
But in a world where we do not do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it , we were at least where we were going to invest first .
And treatment is a much more expensive , much more expensive .
So the <unk> amine , what this focus is to say we can do much more to invest in .
It &apos;s much for the amount of money that we spend , and we can do X X with treatment , and 10 times more .
So once again , we have focused on more than treatment as a first option .
What this is doing is that it really makes us think about our priorities .
And I would like you to look at yourself at your own list and say , you know , you know ?
Should I come to something like you , or you have to have something similar to what we did here ?
Well , let &apos;s say , OK , one of the things that is again to change climate change .
There &apos;s a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very unlikely that we did that .
And we were going to do this change , if there &apos;s no other reason , because it &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we haven &apos;t done all the tested .
We have a lot of problems in the world .
And what I want to assure you is that if we focus on problems , we will make ourselves better .
In those that we can do much more well .
And I think , the truth — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants of the &quot; &quot; give , &quot; &quot; the very good .
One of the things that people do , and that in 100 years , when we &apos;re going to talk about most of the impacts of climate change , people will be much more , much richer .
Even the rug has more benefited from the U.N. in the U.N. .
It &apos;s estimated that a media person in the developing world will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , it &apos;s about two times richer than the ones we are .
And naturally , we will be even richer than that .
But the problem is , when we talk about saving people , help people in Bangladesh , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bestters .
We &apos;re talking about a lot of wealthy Dutch .
And so the real topic , naturally , that I &apos;m saying , we want to spend a lot of money to do a little bit about here in a hundred years , to a very wealthy <unk> <unk> .
or we want to help the poor people , or we want to help the poor people , or we want to help the poor people , we can actually help them , and who can help the poor people ?
Or as they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , imagine you &apos;re rich — how will it happen — a rich rich , a wealthy year , a wealthy year , a wealthy year , a wealthy year , a wealthy year in 2100 thinking , &quot; &quot; How do you care about it so that you need to have a little bit with this issue of changing climate change , and if you care so little about my grandmother and my great-grandfather , who could have helped help me , what do they do ? &quot;
Even if they don &apos;t agree with this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s fundamentally because climate change has a good photos .
You know , you know that we have &quot; &quot; Saln &apos; &quot; &quot; — it seems great , no ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense of what I want to see , right , but I don &apos;t believe that , I don &apos;t believe that , I don &apos;t believe that , I don &apos;t believe that , I don &apos;t believe that , I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll have a film .
So in a lot of ways , I think the sense of &quot; &quot; Bull &quot; &quot; and the entirety of the priorities of the priorities of the priorities of the priorities .
To make sure that it &apos;s not just to do it , it &apos;s not just to do it .
But it &apos;s not going to do things that you have the biggest limitations , but it &apos;s going to be about making places where we can actually do a bigger good thing .
The other objections , I think , that they &apos;re important , is that there &apos;s a fake choice .
Of course we have to do it all , we have to do it all , in a way that we have to do it all , we have to do it all , we have to do it .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice what we did , right now , that in 1970 in the developing world .
Because our help are reduced to half .
It doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re in the way to solve all the big problems .
In the same way , people would also say , but that &apos;s the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend a hundred billion . Why do we not spend the right in the world .
I &apos;m an expert .
If you can talk with Bush to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But of course , it &apos;s still going to say , that if you &apos;ve had the other 100 billion dollars , it &apos;s still wanting to spend better ways , no ?
So the real problem , it is to start again and think about what the right priorities are .
Should I mention briefly , is this really the list right list ?
You know , when you ask the best economists out of the world , you &apos;re going to stop asking you to have white men and old people from the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily equal to look at the whole world .
So we invited 80 percent of all the world to solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying at college , and they speak English .
Most of them were , first of them , in developing countries .
They had the same material , but they could move away from the theme of the vocabulary , as they really did , to put their own lists .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and other diseases at the bottom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There &apos;s a lot of other conservative assistants and college students and different things .
They all had as a result result .
And that gave me a big hope , really , to say that there &apos;s a way forward to start to think about our priorities , and say , what &apos;s the most important thing in the world ?
Of course , in a good world , it would love to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do it all , we can start to think where we start ?
I can see the sense of Coab as a process .
So we were in 2004 , and we &apos;re hoping for a lot more people , to get much better information in 2008 , 2012 .
Now , I &apos;ve tried the right way to the world , but we also start to think about politics .
And to start to think , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t do the things that we can do , but we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we do not know how to do it , but we do it very well , where we can do this huge , low cost , right now , right now . In the end of the day , you can be in danger with the vocabulary of how we can actually do it , but we have to be honest with it to say , if there &apos;s
So if we care a lot about some things , let us not care for others .
So I hope that I hope that it helps us to improve the priorities of the priorities , and think how we worked better for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I went out of the house without keys .
I was going to go home and visit a friend on the other side of the city because the temperature causes the two scales . I was very cold .
And I was on the portal , looking at us and tell us that I had no keys .
In fact , it could candles on the window of the balcony table , where the left came .
But they were all close .
I couldn &apos;t give it the night in my friend , because in the morning , I had a flight for Europe , and I was able to take care of it .
So I met and I died from the cold cold and pee on the window .
I was going to make a lot of money , but neither more than a shot in the middle of the night .
Well , she &apos;s eating the neuroscience of science .
So let &apos;s cut it , which elevates the heart rate of the level of adrenalin .
So the next morning when I went to sleep , I love the window and the gathered that I &apos;d had in Europe had the primary mind .
And until I got to the airport , I didn &apos;t realize that they had forgotten her .
So I went back to home , with snow and ice and ice , over 40 minutes , I went back to the airport , I went back to the airport , I went back to the airport , I went back to the airport , I went back to the airport , I went back to the airport , I went back to the airport and I went to time , but I imagined my way to another person .
Or , in the case that there &apos;s no bad things , it &apos;s not bad .
And Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and Danny told me I was , and
It was something that I had taken from the Israeli &quot; Kerihn who write about this was a few years ago , and it &apos;s also called bitten .
So , no ?
Well , it &apos;s just like explained , like Danny Danny Danny , and then try to determine what you can do .
So what I want to talk to you today is what we can do today is what we can do today is what we can do today .
Some things are self-evident , others aren &apos;t so much .
I &apos;m going to start by self-teeth .
It gets places for all the home for the things they &apos;re going easily .
Well , this seems common sense , and it &apos;s like this .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus , which evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remind the point of important things , where it &apos;s the stroke , where you can catch the tribes , where you see the tribes and the tribes .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain in the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain &apos;s part of the brain .
In fact , there was one guy who did the experiment to put him in front of his own sense of the squirrel .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t move too much and not with things they move .
So there &apos;s a place called a place for the keys .
For the sports , a specific device .
If you &apos;re sitting in a place , and if you care about it , you &apos;re going to be in your place when you go .
And when we travel ?
My email was an email to get the cloud to get the cloud .
These seem self-evident things .
Remember that when you &apos;re under stress , the brain emits green .
The slice is toxic , and it hurts the mind .
It &apos;s in knowing that low stress cannot give you the best of you , and you could find some system .
that when you faced a medical decision .
And all of you will be somewhere right now in a situation in a situation in a situation where all of you are somewhere in a situation in a situation .
And I want to talk about it .
or any decision that we have to do to do something that we have to do , or any decision that we have to do , or any decision that we have to do to do , or any decision that we have to do to do , or any decision that we have to do to do , or any decision that we have to do to do , or any decision that we have to do to do , or any decision that we have to do to do , or any decision that we have to
We &apos;re going to put it into the physician and this says , &quot; I have the results of the tests and have the cholesterol score . &quot;
You know , the high cholesterol score , you know that high cholesterol cholesterol .
And so you can think that have the cholesterol cholesterol is not very good at , and the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want you to do a drug , you know it &apos;s one of the drugs and you know that they are one of the drugs and you know that they are one of the drugs and you know that they are one of the drugs and you know that they are .
Would you want to ask a statistics to ask a statistic .
It &apos;s the necessary number to treat . &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s the NNT ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to take that medication before that person .
What would you think of statistics is that ?
The number should be one . My physician didn &apos;t bother .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
We don &apos;t don &apos;t know well .
Gaxon Kamen estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So the NNT in the case of the most affected of what is ?
How many people do you have to get bad before it ?
So this second results , the results of the results that the results were on .
I even imagined the data .
And you &apos;ll think you &apos;ll be able to be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;re going to be able to think you &apos;re going to be able to think you &apos;re going to be able to think you &apos;ll be able to be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;ll be able to think you &apos;ll be able to
In the case of this drug drug drug , in the case of this drug drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in the case of this drug drug , in
And I &apos;m interested as a lot of bad things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But you &apos;ll see , &quot; &quot; An five percent . I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; But you think , &quot; &quot; A five percent . I don &apos;t think I know .
You have 15 times more meaning than the drug and the drug drug and the drug .
I &apos;m not saying if you could take it out or not do it or not .
You only should have this conversation with your physician .
You &apos;re right now to have access to this information for the power to talk to you about to talk about this information to be going to talk to you .
I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , which I talk about this number to smiles , but in reality , the NNT , I think of this number to smiles .
The prostate prostate cancer , NNT is 49 .
Yes , there is to come up to 49 million people who help .
And the side effects in this case is 50 percent of the patients .
Now , they don &apos;t get it , they &apos;re hardwired , incontintile .
So , the idea of the pursuit has to have the conversation .
The ideal is not having to create all this at the moment .
There are also to think about issues like life quality .
They are things that we have to think about now and talk about the family and loved ones .
Think about : low stress , the brain emits green and one of the things that happens at the moment is that if you go to a lot of systems .
And evolution gives us the explanation .
Because if the body goes into metabolism in these things , because if the body goes metabolism in these things and we don &apos;t very slow down rapidly rapidly , because if the body goes metabolism in these things and we don &apos;t slow down rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly fast rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly rapidly
And luckily , one of the things that acts like Krinneman and their colleagues .
So we need training to think , to think , to think , to be able to be able to think clear in this kind of place .
I think the most important thing is to recognize that we all have ever achieved .
In some time we &apos;re going wrong .
Now , the idea is to think clear what can be these wrong , identify systems that can minimize the damage or just avoiding those things that are bad .
Let &apos;s come back to that night with snow in real , and when I came back from the door of the door of the house inside and an easy code to remember .
They &apos;re not completely organized organized organized organized .
Bo !
Are you ?
anyone ? No one ? No , no .
&quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot;
I wanted to look like I was looking at , and I wanted to look like it , and I wanted to look like it , and I wanted to look like it , and I wanted to look like it , and I wanted to look like it .
You see , you see , you see , you see , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to see it .
I &apos;d like to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m going to talk to myself , and I &apos;m going to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m going to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m going to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m going to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m going to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m going to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m going to have to talk to me , and I &apos;m
Just a word has done a word that a young man was born .
How can I speak like this ?
I started thinking .
I took a lot of it .
How do we come here ?
Right now , right now , now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right

Or we &apos;re not a language that we &apos;re talking about , or we &apos;re working at work , and it &apos;s not a language that we &apos;ve taken on the job .
But we have another more important reality .
And there are studies that have told me that to master other languages , and there are studies that have told us that to master other languages , and there are studies that are told for other languages to master other languages , and there are studies who are told for other languages to master other languages , and there are studies who are told for other languages to master other languages , and there are studies who are told for other languages to master other languages , and there are studies who are told for other languages to

And with some other ideas .
And when he started writing English in English English , he started writing English in English .
When we go back to their writings of English , when they read their writings in English , they were when they read their writings on English .
You can feel that it &apos;s the same person .
Second of them , they &apos;re suffering their tongue .
This reality is a good scene .
The German characters , the French ones , the Japanese ones , the Japanese ones .
And that thought , it hasn &apos;t come to us , but it &apos;s like years to get the world , but it &apos;s like the world &apos;s right thinking .
For that developed world , Malawi was going to be able to get out of the world to get this new world , and as it turns out , Mally and others , who took them their tongue at the time that progress was .
They gave me his cup .
Because if you take any product product to know that it &apos;s not a local product .
Nobody would believe it was a local product .
They were going to go back to be consumers , including ignorant , ignorant , ignorant , ignorant and ignorant , they &apos;re going to go back .

Language are not one , two words or three words or letters in row .
Or if a kid in her hand and says , &quot; &quot; Please , &quot; &quot; in English , you &apos;ve seen when people were going to say , &quot; &quot; Please , &quot; &quot; you would have found when people were going to say &quot; &quot; Thank you ?
How do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better than stop and stop talking about it .
What I want to say is that those misguided you see in a specific reminder .
I have a friend of speech that I &apos;m going to get out of a chimpanzee .
Once I asked her all .
And I said , &quot; &quot; All right , but once I spent the whole night I try to get translated out to them .
You know , it &apos;s not that she &apos;s not able to tell that his husband , and it &apos;s normal that he doesn &apos;t understand the way it &apos;s different .
She said , &quot; &quot; He listen to the Frosz with me , and one night , I tried to translated it to you , and one night , I tried to translated it to you that I feel when I am when I got to Fhelz Felz . &quot; &quot; Now , there &apos;s a lot of it .
( Applause ) Okay , what we did to protect the Arab language ?
We &apos;ve been able to take civil society , and we move civil society .
But still a lot of people say , &quot; &quot; Why bother ?
It acts like this , and it &apos;s looking at it . &quot; &quot; So , this problem is !
In the campaign to preserve the Arab Rights launches , the next one is going to be the next one .
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t accept this , because that we don &apos;t understand .
And when someone talks like this , I hate the Arabic .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I love you that we want to change our reality , and be convinced that we want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our lives , aspirations and day .
You know , as you view as we think about it .
After that , we launched photos of young young men and playing with Arab characters .
They were like young people and they move on English .
We are a lot of &quot; &quot; cociol &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; English &quot; &quot; English .
And at any point , I said , &quot; &quot; Hey , you &apos;ve had a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopted the word &quot; &quot; Jaws &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopted a nice word and spiritual word .
I &apos;ll just follow the Internet .
or what they think they have authority on us , what is it that they think they have authority on us , where it comes to language , or what they think they have authority on us , where it comes to language , or what they think they have authority on us , where it comes to language , or what they think they have authority on us , where it comes to language .
The creativity is the way .
Start from right now .
One novel is a novel that I could get older .
It could lead the Arab script again .
But we have to know that , and we have to know that there &apos;s a solution , and we have the way to be part of it .
In short , what can I do you since now ?
Let &apos;s go , let &apos;s look , who &apos;s going wrong ?
Please go , well , I know my time was a foundation , even though my time was a base .
But I don &apos;t have to write in Arabic with Latino characters .
( Applause ) So it &apos;s a hit ! It &apos;s not a tongue .
They &apos;d come up with a virtual world with virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
The babies identify their children first to their father &apos;s father &apos;s father .
So when I was born my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is my friend , I said , &quot; &quot; This is my favorite , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s not , &quot; &quot; Tham , &quot; &quot; . &quot;
What is happening in mind &apos;s mind ?
If we asked this about 30 years , most people , I would say that this baby is irrational , I would say that this baby is irrational , and I wouldn &apos;t understand a process of acceptable that person or not understand a process of effect .
Over the past 20 years , science science has completely completed this theory .
In a certain way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the day of scientists .
I &apos;m going to give you an example .
One thing that I could be thinking could be thinking about this baby , that could be happening in their mind , is to treat what &apos;s happening in the mind of another baby .
In the end of the cable , one of the most difficult things for all of us is to treat what other people think and feel .
And perhaps most difficult to understand that what other people think and feel not the same thing that we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s so much of the political can say the hard thing to do this .
We wanted to know if babies and children could understand this very complex idea about other people .
Now , the problem is , how can we ask you ?
The babies don &apos;t speak , and if we &apos;re going to ask a kid in three years that tell us what it thinks , we &apos;re going to be able to be a mon<unk> ous thoughts of thoughts about it .
How can we then ask you ?
It turns the secret to the menu .
Betty Raashi , one of my students , and I said , we gave them the babies two signatures with food : one with selling , and another with brilliant and other people with bad people .
And all the babies , even in Berkeley , they love them and they don &apos;t like it .
( Laughter ) Then , what was 17 was looking at food from two .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I liked it or not what I tested .
Now , half of the time , I told you that I &apos;d like to love the gallery and I didn &apos;t like it .
But the other half , they took a little bit of rebellion , and he said , &quot; &quot; K<unk> , stupid .
I &apos;ve been socializing it . M<unk> . &quot; &quot; And then they got a little sticker , and he said &quot; &quot; Aania , &quot; &quot; and it said , &quot; &quot; Aania , you &apos;re going to get it .
I brought them off . Aania , bomb . &quot; &quot; He said , I thought , I was like the opposite of what I love the babies .
We did this with 15 and 18 months .
Then Betty sent her hand and said , &quot; Give me a little bit ? &quot;
The question was , if you ask babies what would like them like them ?
The surprising thing was that the babies of the 18-few months , that end of the beginning and talking about what I liked to love and talk about , we &apos;re going to love them if they liked it .
On the other hand , the babies of the 15 months were going to look at it as I thought I had to enjoy the rebellion , as if I couldn &apos;t understand it .
And after you look at it for a mouse , you would put it away , what you thought would be the whole world .
So there are two data from this .
For one side is that the babies of 18 months have been discovered , this important act of human nature : we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understand that they can act to help other people get what they burn .
And more interesting interesting , is that the babies of the 15 months don &apos;t do this ; what suggests that children from the age of the age of 15 months will have this profound act of being killed in the three months that they &apos;re separated from the next three months that they &apos;ve separated from the next three months .
So babies know more and learned more than we &apos;re thinking about now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that ran over the last 20 years showing this done .
What if you can ask you now is : Why are kids learning so ?
How is it possible to learn so long ?
I mean , the first view , babies seem pretty much useful .
And in so many times , they are worse , because we have to use a lot of time and energy just in keep them alive .
If we reevaluate the evolution to look at this mystery of what we spend so long ago , it turns out that there &apos;s a response answer to this story , it turns out that there &apos;s a response response to what &apos;s useful .
So if you look at various species , not only other people have like us , but also other words , birds , even a birds like the canley or the coast , it turns out there are a relationship between childhood , and the most asset of the brain and the species of species .
One example of this , we gave these birds that you can see here .
For one side we have the front of New Yorkers .
It &apos;s the front of you and others , and others , you &apos;re going to , you &apos;re going to be very clever .
Instead they &apos;re as clever as the chimps .
And this is a little bit similar that it has learned how to use tools to get food .
On the other hand , we have to put our domestic capital .
The geyser , as the ducks , and the geese , they &apos;re paralyzed like the rocks .
They are very good at adding , but they &apos;re not very good at doing anything else .
And it turns out that the babies of the New Yorker , the pioped the ones , the pioped the ones , the pioped of New England .
It depended on that their peers to put the worms in the mouth to the two years of life , which is a lot of time in a bird &apos;s life .
However , the geyps are young people in just a couple months .
And so childhood is the reason that they &apos;re taking care of the scientific journals that you &apos;re looking at in the world and the soup .
There &apos;s something on the long time that it seems to be linked with knowledge and learning .
What could we have to do this ?
Some animals like it , they seem to do something very well .
So geyts are very good at taking a particular environment .
Other creatures like it , they &apos;re not especially good at doing anything particular , but they &apos;re really good learning the norms of different ways .
And of course , we humans are very far away .
We have better brains with our bodies , much more than any other animal .
More clever , more prosperous , we can learn more , we can survive more , we can survive all the planet and even the space .
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So at least 23 to 23 , we follow them these little spots in their mouths .
Okay , so why do we look at this pattern ?
One idea is that the strategy was , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way , and it &apos;s a very powerful way to join in this world .
It turns out that if you &apos;re grateful for it , if it &apos;s helpless .
It wasn &apos;t good that you would have told us , and I &apos;d like to think , &quot; I &apos;ve had a little shot or a sailboat ? What will it better ? &quot;
It would be better to know that before they look at them .
And the way that evolution releases this problem was , it seems like it seems to be .
So we have this period of time where we &apos;re completely protecting .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . I just learned .
And then , of adults , we can take that that we &apos;ve learned from babies and children and they put it in practice and we move around the world .
One way to think about this is that babies and small children are like the department of Investiulation and tangles of human species .
They are the protecting people who are researching , which they only have to go out , learn and have good ideas , and we are the production and commercialization .
We have to take all these ideas that we &apos;ve learned from children and putting them in practice .
Another way to look at is , instead of thinking about babies and children as advanced adults , to think about them as human beings , think about them as a different set of developmental development , but the babies would like them , but the babies would like to see them as a different state of the same species .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows us that so that it &apos;s a lot of powerful learning devices .
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But the real computers are doing so much .
It &apos;s being a revolution in our way to understand the learning machines .
And all of the ideas of this man in this man , Professor Thomas Byes , a statistical statistical piece of the 18th century .
Belically , Byygan offered a mathematician who was used to characterize the theory to characterize and describing the way that scientists found things in the world .
What scientists do do is plant a hypothesis , something that we can start .
Then they were able to get that chance with tests .
The evidence is to change the chance , and the decision to change the hypothesis , and the evidence that makes them change the hypothesis .
I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to show you all with new tests , and so on .
What Byters showed was a mathematician who could do that .
And math are the basis of the best teaching programs we have today .
Ten years ago , I suggested that babies were supposed to be doing the same .
If you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> ons , I think it &apos;s something that looks like much like something like this .
( Laughter ) So in the short time , I met the notes of Professor Dyes .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculating calculating and how they look like this .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove .
If you ask a businessadult , you can be pretty stupid .
How is it possible for kids to do statistics ?
And to try to try this , we &apos;re using a machine that we have to call &quot; &quot; Fortin . &quot;
It &apos;s a box that stretches out of it , and it sounds like it &apos;s a little bit of it .
And by taking this machine as simple as simple , in my lab , and also others , if they did grade evidence about what are children learning about the world .
I &apos;ve shown you just one thing we did with &quot; &quot; K<unk> , &quot; &quot; one of my students .
If you give you this detector probably , you would probably start to think that the way to extend it is to put a vaccine that you can see that the way to put it up .
But the case is that the Kinect works in a way .
If you look at a vaccine that &apos;s on the Kinect , something that we don &apos;t think at a beginning , the Kinect is two times every three times .
In order to go out what we &apos;re going on , what would you look like , it &apos;s just a couple of every six times .
So the chance less likely to have a lot more self-evident .
It turns out that the strategy was to let the object is more important than another .
So we explain these data from four years and we gave them them to try .
And with security , children from four years ago , they ran the data on the detector .
There are two basic data in this done .
The first one , remember that are children in four years , and the first one , remember that are children in four years .
who are learning to tell you that they are learning to count .
But inunstable are already doing calculating calculating calculating calculating calculating issues .
The second insight is that they &apos;re using the data to get an idea , a hypothesis about the world , which seems to be a little bit familiar at the beginning .
So in studies we present in the lab , other similar children , we &apos;ve shown that these children four years are better figuring out how adults , given the same task .
In these conditions , children do have statistics to disging things about the world , but scientists have experienced them , after all , and we wanted to see if kids were experienced too .
That &apos;s what we often call &quot; &quot; pull out &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a lot of interesting studies lately that showed these games are like a kind of experimental research program .
We show one of the lab &apos;s lab &apos;s lab .
He had had been used or again Explorer .
He showed the children that the Millennium Goals has been working and the red doesn &apos;t , and they &apos;ll show them a malfunction .
What we &apos;re going to see now is this young boy in two minutes in time .
No : So ?
Nabon : Just as on the other side .
Alson : Well , the first chance .
Nabon : No . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Nine of it , but this is not .
Alson : So , I was describing to you .
Nabon : Why do this ?
( Laughter ) Nine : I don &apos;t understand .
Alson : scientists will recognize that face face .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
Koran : Lw , chance two .
Child : So it has to be .
Child : You cannot be .
( Laughter ) Koran : Now the next idea .
He asked the researcher that she would try to write on the other .
It hasn &apos;t worked .
Child : Oh , it &apos;s because light only goes to here , not until there .
She took this box there , but this doesn &apos;t .
Koran : Well , that would be the fourth fourth field .
Nabon : Right now .
If you spend four bloggers .
If you &apos;re going to be four on this , you get out of that and two to the other .
Koran : Well , that &apos;s the chance .
This kid is — it &apos;s a very strong child , and yet I said that it &apos;s a typical kid .
If you look at how children play children , if we ask them something , what do they do , what do they do .
All recent of the children in 4 years .
Well , what is this kind of creature ?
What if it feels like one of these confusion that can be testing five hypotheses ?
If we go to psychologists of psychologists and philosophers , a lot of say that babies and children are just aware , or even that they &apos;re not conscious .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more aware of adults .
This is what we know about how adulthood works .
The awareness and attention of an adult adulthood looks like this .
What &apos;s happening in adults is that when we decide it is important or relevant , we play attention .
And the awareness of this is what we &apos;re looking at , and it &apos;s very intense , they lie that the rest almost than .
We also know what happens in the brain .
When you pay attention to something , the frontal lobe of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the brain , is that a little bit of the brain , and it &apos;s more than learning ; it &apos;s better than learning ; and apathy to the rest of the brain .
We have this very centric attention , guided by purpose .
If you look at babies and children , you see something very different .
I think babies and children seem to have a more similar insight to one aspect of it .
Now , babies and children would have a lot of attention to each other .
But they would give them very well to take a lot of information to the time .
And if you look at your brains , what you see is that they are <unk> ating by <unk> ers that induced learning and plasticity , and that &apos;s not the cable .
So when we say that babies and children have issues to pay attention , what really means is that it costs them not to pay attention .
I &apos;d like to leave you of the interesting things that I could have to say something for just one thing .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness that we have to expect these blobs that are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a way to feel that kind of childhood imagination as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases where we were in a new situation , or when we &apos;re going to get a city for the first time .
In those cases , the awareness of consciousness doesn &apos;t use it , but it turns out that in three days in Paris there are more awareness and experiments that all the months back on the house , and let &apos;s talk about it , by talking about them .
For some of that cup , that little cup that we take down , actually prevented the effect of <unk> ds .
So how is a baby ?
It &apos;s like being a boyfriend in Paris , for the first time , and after you would have three vases of them .
( Laughter ) So a wonderful feeling , but if you &apos;re going to cry every morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s good .
I don &apos;t mean it &apos;s too much about the great babies .
It &apos;s good .
You can do things like yourself , but you can do things like you or cross the street .
And it has a sense that we &apos;re using a lot of effort to make babies think like adults .
But if what we want to do is be like these physiology , you have the open mind , to be open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovative , innovative — maybe by the least time , we have to make sure that adults think a little bit like children .

These are simple objects : exotic angels , keys , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses , lenses
They are the other things that the victims of the genocide in Boscopania are the things that the victims of the genocide in Bosania are the things that the victims of the genocide in Boscopania are the things that the victims of the genocide in Boscopania are the things that the victims of the genocide in Boscopania are the things that the victims of the genocide are in Bosania .
We are all made to these mundane damage and everyday objects .
And the fact that some victims would take objects like the paste or the feces of teeth is a sign that had no idea what it was .
They would tell you that they &apos;d be connected to them .
These objects have been shown by numerous parts of my land , and we mentor , we &apos;re talking about the world &apos;s bodies that have been known for 20 years after the war .
And they are perhaps the biggest underdiscovered of the Sun .
For the four years of the conflict that &apos;s sad or Bosania on the top of the 1990s , some 35,000 citizens , are most of the most , they &apos;re going to disappear , and we are probably killed , and other 250,000 were killed were killed during the city of combat .
The more they &apos;ve been killed , well in the early days of war , or well face the end of the conflict , they hunt in hands .
The foreign court dictate whether and they &apos;re hoping for crimes against humanity and genocide and genocide against humanity and genocide .
Early on it is the systemic power of a ethnic group , political , religious and racial diversity .
Conf<unk> is so much to skeletal muscle .
How about the property , the heritage of the cultural heritage , the adaptation of the cultural heritage , and basically any one of their existence from their existence , the adaptation of the cultural heritage , and basically any one of their existence from their existence , the adaptation of the cultural heritage , the adaptation of the cultural heritage , and essentially any one of their existence from their existence , the adaptation of the cultural heritage , the adaptation of the cultural heritage , and essentially any one of their existence of their existence , which
The genocide is not just the waste ; it &apos;s the identity of identity .
Whenever there is no perfect crime , there &apos;s no perfect crime .
It &apos;s always going to be stripped away from strangers than their bodies fragile more than their bodies vanish , or that our heritage and weak memory .
These objects refused to stand out of a lot of common events and the goal of reunified content is a unique process of what they disappeared in the first act of genocide in Europe from the Ho<unk> ust .
No body should no longer discover or without <unk> <unk> .
One time if you get these objects that the victims took them back to their emergency department , they &apos;re going to get a little bit away if and so skeptical if they &apos;re going to get these objects that the victims were going to get out there .
Milles of them , if you &apos;re in plastic cards like you see in CSI.
So if you think about how powerful tools in the victims of the victims of the victims , they are suffering as a representative of the war in the world , but also as a representative range of people in the World War II , but also as a representative representative of the war in the world , but also as a representative representative of the war in the world , but also as a representative representative of the war in the world , but also as a representative range of people in the world , but also as
Sometimes it &apos;s called the superformation to identify them , but visual recognition is a difficult process , inefficient and painful process is a difficult way to identify them .

A few years ago I decided to photograph each object in order to create a visual archive that made birth to be able to handle a visual archive that the superliving in terms of the <unk> ages .
I like to give myself the bow to the <unk> ist and I like to give it to the bow .
And in this case , they can recognize objects or not at this case , and in this case , they can recognize the objects , and in this case , they can recognize the objects , and in this case , they can recognize the objects or the least that occurred .
The photograph is empathy and the <unk> ity of these powerful objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , if you &apos;d like , and the result is the most possible thing to a document , and the result is the most possible thing to a document .
When identify at the same time , they &apos;re going to go on their bodies and these ordinary objects .
In all of his simplicity , these objects are the adadmissions of the victims of the day that these people have been involved with the last one of the day that these people have been involved in these sorts of objects .
Thank you very much .

A few years ago , so I decided to follow the footprints of the American philosopher , KorgSolutions , and a few years ago , so I decided to follow the pasting of the National Geographic .
There are some things I &apos;ve learned with these challenges .
I don &apos;t want to show you the months of the months that the months don &apos;t love to fly , they forgot , if not time was much more memorable .

I &apos;m here to share my picture .
Is this photograph ?
Because of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t do with your cameras .
With all , my interest in the photograph began when I became my first digital camera at the 15 years .
And I &apos;ve studied with my passion before I imagined , was a little different , because by using a camera with the process I was younger in design .
And when a photograph of a camera with a camera , the process turns out when you get a shot .
For me to the photograph I had to see with being in the core place , at the end of the city .
I look like anyone else could do .
So I want to create something different , something that is a different way , something where the process is going to get the baseline .
You &apos;ve seen like this : a very transit-based road .
But it has an unexpected enemy .
And yet , from this , it reflects a level of realism .
Or some photos like these — dark dark and open to the time , but all of the common target to keep the realism level .
When I &apos;m going to realism it .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually be captured but I always want it to it , but I always want it to look like it was captured in some way .
You have to have a moment to think a moment to discover the trick .
So this is more than seeing a idea that with capturing a second moment .
But what is the trick that makes it look like ?
Do you have to see the details or with the colors ?
Do you have to see with light ?
What creates the confusion ?
The times the perspective is the illusion .
But by the end of our way , it &apos;s not about our way to interpreting the world and how it can be aware on a two-dimensional surface .
Actually , it &apos;s not about it , but what we think is realist .
So the basics are very simple .
I &apos;m going to be like a head of reality where we take different bits of reality and together to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
So here we have three physical objects , something that we all can relate to live in a three-dimensional world .
But I &apos;ve actually kind of can create something that still looks like three-dimensional .
But at the same time , we know that it cannot exist .
So we look at our brain because the brain just doesn &apos;t accept the fact that that really has no sense .
And I see the same process by using pictures .
It really is in combining different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look like a photograph , I believe that they don &apos;t even don &apos;t even think about ; the things that controls us in our life would be .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have in account this . Because of the contrary to it .
So I &apos;d like to say that there are three to be just three percent of them to follow realistic outcomes .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combine it , you can create something like this .
So the first line is that the photos combine to have the same perspective .
Second , the astronomical photos must have the same amount of light .
And these two images reported in these requirements ; they were taking the same time and the same amount of light .
The third point is to do impossible to tell you where they start and so different images with a perfect marker .
It has to be impossible to say as a picture .
By changing the color of color , contrast and shine to the limitations that there are between the different images , adding up to a tiny bit as small field of field , colors and noise and noise and noise and noise and noise and noise and noise and noise .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) You could think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is what was manipulated .
But this image is completely composed of different places .
And I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that I &apos;m a place for , because a lot of it doesn &apos;t need to compromise the ideas that you have in your head .
But this requires a lot of design .
And as I thought this idea was in the winter , I knew I had a few months for design , to find the different places for the bits of the world .
For example , the fish was captured in a way to paste .
The back is a different range .
Now , the Nobel laureates was caught in a stone garden .
And so I did , even I was in red the landing house of the island that I was going to suggest more .
So for you to get a realist , I believe you do design .
It &apos;s always a little bit a little bit .
So there is to combine different pictures .
And here each piece is very good .
If a good job makes a good job to take the photos the result it can be very beautiful and then rerealist .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that is crucial is our imagination .
Thank you .
