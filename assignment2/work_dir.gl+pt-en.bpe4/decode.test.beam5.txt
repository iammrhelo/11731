It was a fall afternoon .
I worked out of science at the ACSU , the Prime Minister by the Liberal .
I loved my job , but precisely that day , I would feel a little bit excited .
So I found myself walking by my fellow fellow Chris Hancock .
I took over 30 years working on ACO , so they knew the work of the institutions .
I told Chris you to sit down a little bit .
I was researching a number of questions about the intersection of science and freedoms and freedoms — very interesting .
But I wanted to tell the ACU : &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; a lot more face , a way you could imagine .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So Chris went to the great question , and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; All of these things , what are the five ones you want you to do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Are you all those things you want to do ? &quot;
Well , it &apos;s about against the genetics of genetics , the productive technologies , the <unk> <unk> ers and ...
There &apos;s also a great thing , because there &apos;s a great deal , the job of I-time , and ...
Of course , the topic of genetic patent is .
Yes , that &apos;s , that is , patent with human genes .
&quot; No ! &quot;
I mean , the U.S. government exposes the patent of the human body .
It can &apos;t be like , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; I got to my tears , and I sent me to Chris three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came out .
&quot; Give me ! We had no reason . &quot;
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what Chris is a great lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost anything about commercial trade and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it didn &apos;t break a lot , much fewer physicists .
I was so clear that there was a lot of clear that I learned before they had to learn before .
First of all , we had to know exactly what the patent is when somebody patent a gene .
The genetic patent we used to include dozens of leafors , but the most discussed of all are the calls &quot; &quot; DNA &quot; &quot; or whether it &apos;s a DNA piece of DNA .
So with this saying , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t we patent the genes of your body , we don &apos;t patent the genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , it &apos;s more likely to take the genes .
And the patent troll doesn &apos;t have a particular gene , but all the possible features of that gene .
What does this mean ?
Well , you can &apos;t pass your genes to a doctor , and ask you what indidists of , to see if you have a device , without the permission from the patent .
We also found that the patent troll has the right to stop that gene use in research or clinical trials .
I would look at that , and I &apos;d look at that , kid , private companies , put the human genome in the body of the human genome .
We have the case of Abigma , a little bit about 10 years of IQ , a heart disease , a heart disease , if it &apos;s not , can cause the sudden death .
So the company you see in the two genes associated with this illness had a test to diagnose the syndrome .
But then they went into the mountain , and they never came up to the cell .
( Laughter ) But the company I &apos;m going to patent with , but the company , the company , was threatened with the threatened .
Two years without being able to do it .
Over that time , he Absecr died of raw IQ .
The genetic patent was a problem that saved the patients .
Is there any way in the front ?
Well , it turns out that the Supreme Court left of course was in a long list of cases , that there &apos;s a number of things that don &apos;t sound patent .
You can &apos;t afford nature &apos;s products : the air , the water , the minerals , the vibrating elements of the periodic table .
Not neither the laws of nature : the law of gravity , E = 2 .
It &apos;s very fundamental , and you need to be able to reach out of all , and you need to be able to make it all possible , and you need to be able to make it all possible .
And in our opinion , the structure of the most fundamental life , that encode the production of all of our proteins , is so much a product of nature like a law of nature like a law of nature , regardless of it and our bodies .
For the best , we traveled the best world to talk about different experts : scientists , professional physicians , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers
Most we &apos;ve told us that we had a reason for a political view of political view , and when it &apos;s in theory , since a legal perspective .
And they all thought the possibility of coming out of our own topic were so many of us like this .
But why ?
It turns out that the patent office leads to make these extra patents over 20 years .
So literally , there were millions of patent genes .
The patent court was very addicted to the status quo , the biotech of the biotech , and the commerce in Silicon Valley is this practice , and the Civil Rights Movement , which is a year after Congress , who had a year later .
I mean , the courts weren &apos;t supposed to be willing to master these patent .
But , I don &apos;t know , and Chris never told me , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s not enough , it &apos;s not enough , it &apos;s not enough , it &apos;s not enough , it &apos;s good for years to follow .
So we started to remember our cause .
The ultimate reliance on land use to be : They &apos;ve been working on it by any technical topic , dark and messy .
We didn &apos;t have interested in that kind of causes , we think our causes rate much more .
It &apos;s about scientific liberty , the health and the rights of the patients .
So we decided to open a cause that we wouldn &apos;t be like the ones that there are for patent , but a cause of the rights of the world .
We used to be able to identify a robotic patent troll that was driven to defend their patent , for the while , and experts that were told to the courts like this , and why would they tell the courts like these patent and innovation .
So we think the ideal candidate to bind was Mydge , a company with headquarters based , a company based on Salt Lake City .
Mysore name was the patent of two genes , the genes BS and Bank2 .
The women with certain mutations in these genes are even more likely to vote or recognizable .
A total of the 20th century is actually the total of BCRA in the United States .
They did that we had a couple of us to get rid of BCRA set of BCRA .
They &apos;ve seen lots of money by their exam : plus 3,000 dollars .
I stopped sharing their clinical data with international scientific community .
And , if you keep the worst of all , for a long period of a couple of years , Mykean <unk> an art period , Myanan <unk> my test for some researchers in France .
It was estimated that during that period , for a few years , until a couple of years ago , it was 12 percent of the women in the world , and a negative outcome that should be positive .
So this is Kathenigmatic vodka .
The sister of Kathgotá , Eileen , developed cancer with 40 years ago and did exams .
Data has been negative .
The family died .
The most striking thing was that cancer didn &apos;t have the present in the family , so the other family members had not needed to make the examination .
More two years later , Stacey was diagnosed with a pancreatic cancer cancer .
And it turned out that the sister of Kathgotá found among that 12 percent of people who had a very false outcome .
If Eileen is the result of the right result , Stacey would look at the examination , and then he would be able to climb the exam .
So he could burn these problems .
Fitic innovation , four scientific breakthroughs , four scientific breakthroughs that together represent the over 150,000 of 150,000 scientists that have set up the over 150,000 of 150,000 and medical professionals , and women both individual women who were blogging , or they wanted a second , because of the patent .
One of the main challenges we &apos;re facing when we prepare when we prepare this case was to think the way we explain science .
To tell you that what did I do when I was not an agent , and the genetics means of nature , we had to explain a pair of basic concepts from the guy : What is a gene ? What is a gene ? What is the DNA ?
So how did it work , and why isn &apos;t it that it &apos;s not just a stick ?
We spend time and hours with our <unk> <unk> ers before and experts , trying to make a way to explain these things differently .
And then we end up in the end of the branches , like gold .
So then the DNA is like pulling gold out of a mountain , or the bed of a river .
You &apos;re trying to restore the process to pull gold , but you can &apos;t pathoits own gold .
It &apos;s much harder for work if it &apos;s broken to pull the gold gold ; you can &apos;t deny it , it &apos;s been gold .
And the gold , once of course , can use all sorts of things in the way that you can &apos;t allow when it was in the mountain ; with it , for example , but you can &apos;t pathothe gold , for example . But you can &apos;t pathothe gold , because it &apos;s been gold .
In 2009 , we were ready to make the case .
We have this room in the U.S. New York New York City , and the case will hit it , by the judge , the judge , the judge .
In the mid-2010 , the German Shaet issued him a book : 158 pages .
When you do it your opinion , you interface with us to make it the way you describe the science in the case .
I mean , our report — it was pretty good , but not so good .
How could he develop a deep understanding of the topic in a little while ?
We couldn &apos;t even imagine as possible to something like this .
So it turned out that people who worked at the judge who worked at the judge who was not just a lawyer .
And not only was science — I had a PhD in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Wow .
So then Mythad he called the Apverdian of Ap<unk> .
And here &apos;s the things they understood .
First of all , in a life , the U.S. government changed side .
And in the court court , government issued the issued aside of Mythanger .
But in a direct position in direct position to its own patent shop , government presented a report in what I would say to you , to consider this subject to the light of the window of the city of the city of the district court , which he was able to do it .
This was really important , and fully unexpected .
The Nobel laureates of the Federal Reserve leads all the cases of patent , and it &apos;s called its proposes a lot , and it &apos;s called it .
So even with this event , you &apos;re going to try to lose .
So it was .
More or less .
The decision was from two to one .
But the two Jewish kids who voted against us , they did it by completely different times .
The first one , the judge , has built his own and new theory , completely wrong .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Yeah .
Mythy when I was told I had no meaning .
The other judge , the judge , said that I agreed with us instead being the DNA surrounding the nature of nature .
But I don &apos;t want to go back to the biDepression industry .
So you have to actually have a question that you know from the Supreme Court to respond .
So , these questions put in the form of a paragraph in a long time , a couple of days ago , a couple of Moy-like , called &quot; &quot; chicken , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; so . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , these questions put in the shape of a long time , and a lot .
We &apos;ve done what to do is the short question that we &apos;ve ever experienced .
Five words : Am I patent to see the human genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I think you would say , &quot; &quot; Is it the dinosaur DNA entail ? &quot; &quot; No .
So I want the judge , the way I had the day that I talked about this topic seven years ago . And of course , I &apos;m going to say it ?
The Supreme Court only nodded and around one percent of the cases he took , and he didn &apos;t have to hear our own .
And the day of the Arab Spring , and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people outside , people who had been waiting since two : 30 of the morning to try to get into the livestock .
Two organizations in his chest , they organize an internship at the edge of the cattle .
Chris and I would take us together in the end , moments before he had to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he .
But all of that panic was when I went back in the room and saw me around me , and I saw a lot of detailed tricks : women who knew so long from their own journey , the rich ones who knew a lot of their loved ones , the rich ones who were interested in their own way , the rich ones that have been observed in the court .
And in the room , they also were three leaders of the Human Project and we developed the co-era of the DNA , by James Watson , who came to an end of the court , which I would say , of course , who has been a report of the court , which I would say , is a crazy one .
The claim was credited .
Chris claimed it &apos;s extremely brilliant .
But to me , the most holy thing was to see the police of the Supreme Court trying to understand the DNA surrounding it , through a series of analog architecture , very similar to how to make our legal team for the last seven years .
And then the Army Kop Pop of DNA with a 103 DNA plant .
The World Trade z to make a baseball dog from a tree .
And at that point it was my favorite moment , the judge , the fact that DNA leads , was nature waiting .
A natural segment of DNA is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not likely to be a patent so just because it stays there .
And what it is , Mysore , did not invent anything . &quot; &quot; Twenty-four hours after the decision , five billion hours after the decision , five labs announced that they would start to offer the examination to the genes .
Some of them promise to offer rise to the cheaper exams and then finally .
Some promise was offered to offer a higher examination , which offered to be Mysore .
But the window of the court was opening up .
To save a 25 years that allow us to be able to prevent humans in the United States .
We eat or blame that disease , and biomedical research .
And they helped for patients like al-Qaeda , polarizing and Eileen and Eileen and Eileen .
A few weeks after the court gave his decision , I got a little tomato in the box of email .
It was from Bob Poot , a teacher at the University of Berkeley and one of the first people that I and Chris went to visit and one of the first people who were and Chris went to visit , and one of the first people I had and Chris went to visit and one of the first people who were and Chris went to visit and one of the first people who were and Chris went to visit and one of the first people who were and Chris went to visit and one of the first
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to make it a lot .
Now , part of what it gave us to address those risks was to know that we were doing the right thing .
So the process was only eight years since we first started to end up with a lot , and we didn &apos;t look at the way .
Now , of course , it helped help , but they &apos;ve been the communities that we &apos;ve lined up , and the ones we &apos;ve created , what we gave us .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . Today , let me show you a little bit about eight of my projects of my projects , made out of art .
We &apos;re going to call it &amp; A &amp; D , and we work in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , what I call &quot; &quot; the phone . &quot; &quot; It reminds me of the peculiar , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really hard to ask me , almost like me , almost like me , almost as if I was a heart extension of his body , the lights or take a seat of water or weed .
When I grew up , the thing was the worse and I ate it to see how a way of control .
And of course , I couldn &apos;t say anything , because the guy is a very strong figure out in the experimenter .
What I was laughing at , and was his use of his phone use .
And then he would give me an injection , and he would give me the number one number by he .
And as a response , I think , &quot; &quot; The cell phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that there &apos;s a lot of people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone system to a person .
And the problem is , when I went home and went to university , I started the same amount of time .
So I had a machine writing machine writing with a golden thing I could give her to her commands , and we had all of the world through emails .
What I had to do was take a paper , put paper on the car , write email email or paste the paper .
This device would send automatically the person in a kind of email address .
So here you can see that we put a lot of electronic emails that understand all the actions of life and lead to digital media .
So my great uncle is just a mechanical interface .
And then , since then , the object has to be great and having a touch touch , like my uncle died .
The next job is a sensitive device for the sound we call <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> es . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the way to be surrounded by the tribal and sensitive creatures .
This works like this . We have these branches here on the wall , and behind , we have these little creatures that fall out .
Instead we get silent , intimidate .
And if there &apos;s more silence still , then you ate the bites .
And at the very least they are , they are again .
So we have these marked up in three walls in a room .
And we had some 500 of these little bits of little bits .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a piece of video .
When there &apos;s a silence , you go from the bottom of the pop .
and it seems like humans or real creatures .
And you &apos;ll be able to provide the sounds of sound that you &apos;re frightened of there .
They don &apos;t respond to the bottom .
We hear a study at a moment where they don &apos;t respond .
( Video ) But they respond to the sounds in the foreground . I hear that in a second .
( Cheering ) We work very hard to do the most realistic realistic thing .
Each bone has his own behavior , the psyche , of humor , etc .
This is a very premature .
And of course , it was the best after that .
We had to respond to people , but we saw that people were really guddling together and child with them .
This is a video game video called &quot; &quot; The listener . &quot; &quot; So we were really intrigued by the idea of play a game of invisibility .
How would it be possible to experiment to invisibility ?
We worked with a drug company based on surveillance cameras , and we put a camera with us using a camera that could look at people in the room , follow this person and replace a person with the bottom , and then we see the invisible .
And I &apos;ll show you a very premature .
In the right , you can see in my colleague &apos;s colleague , he &apos;s in space .
And on the left , you see the video processing where the camera makes it invisible .
Sen comes in the fourth . Wow .
You can see how the camera goes and the dawn .
It &apos;s a premature video , so we still don &apos;t let the snow and all of that , but it &apos;s perfect , but it &apos;s perfect .
So we did this in a room where there was a camera looking into space and we had a monitor in every wall .
And second people in the room , they look at themselves in the monitor , except for a difference , except for a difference : a person was constantly invisible in the room .
This job is called &quot; &quot; The Dane of the Sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a piece of paper , like a child , a child , a child from a ball of oil or a sun .
By the way , this object seemed to be very strong and robust , and aside , almost something very weak .
The people would walk through the room and almost the encoder would be thinking about it .
But in the corner , I would start to start walking through the wall of the wall .
It would take off and disliked it .
( Laughter ) This work is a caricature of a man &apos;s caricature .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , which seems to me and his body grows almost like a plant .
What it does is to move around the head of your head as if it &apos;s been drunk in a very conservative movement , and it &apos;s slow down .
It &apos;s like thank you for that circle .
Because if that circle was not there and the soil outside the ground , it would begin to go underground .
And there &apos;s no wireless .
I &apos;ll show you an example . When people come into the room , then it &apos;s activated this object .
And really slowly , in minutes , it &apos;s going to become endless endless , pop speed , and it looks like that &apos;s the point .
This is an important moment , because we wanted to throw it into the viewer &apos;s sake , and help save the subject .
It doesn &apos;t need it because it &apos;s even one of it else .
This work was a really technical question for us , and we work very hard , like most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanical , balance and a perfect legacy .
It was really important for us to establish the exact moment where we would make it , because if we make a way that the balance , then it would damage it , and if it wasn &apos;t enough , it didn &apos;t include it , and it &apos;s not liquid enough , it would be the effect of wanting .
And I &apos;ll show you a very quick clip where we make a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow inmates .
Now it &apos;s got nervous , so it &apos;s going to get it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to do it , because he can go back to himself .
This is a work with which we &apos;ve been very intrigued , working with the aesthetic of the skin , with thousands of different optical fibers , which glow like the night sky .
And it &apos;s on the scale of the night sky .
We put this around a drop in a circle of 18-wheeler , which was pasted out of the living .
The idea was , it was counterintuitive , distant and abstract , like the universe with the familiar shape of a lion &apos;s head , which is very much comforting .
The idea was that somewhere , you will let the shape of a circle from a zeitzene hole and it &apos;s almost like a hole in space , like if you were to watch a bright sky .
This is the last job , even in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; refresh . &quot; &quot; Imagine a pair of mass .
So this object is in constant expansion and counter-revolution to create a dynamic of people moving around , like if you try to look a secret in their own together or something like this .
We worked with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t like the way we like , because it &apos;s a lot of suffering in our work for years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that helps us express emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures we &apos;ve created .
When a creature comes to the mind , and almost like the process of creation , it was to discover the way that this creature wants to exist , that way we want to move and how to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to begin to give you a helpful magic trick not technology , and all the way requires you to do this : that we change it for two minutes .
But before I reveal to you , I want to ask you right now to see your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
You see , how many of you are still in a place ?
( Laughter ) Look , with the naked legs , the vibrating players are playing .
Sometimes we put the arms like this .
Sometimes it turns out , too . ( Laughter ) Ot you .
Just pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going back to this in minutes and I hope that if you &apos;re going to change the way a little bit can change the development of your life .
Well , we are fascinated with the body language and I &apos;m especially interested in the body language .
You know , I &apos;m thinking I was — ( Laughter ) — an architect — ( Laughter ) — a novel , a football game , a football game , an apple game of an eye specialist or even something like a roll .
Narrator : So here are now the number 10 .
This cop is lucky , and he told the president of the United States .
There comes the first minister — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy ! ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy ! Amy from hands , or his fatigue , may surprise us to talk for weeks and weeks .
Even the BBC and the New York Times .
So when we think about quantum tunneling or body language or body language , we intuit we don &apos;t talk about language .
When we talk about communication we think about interactions .
What do I tell your body language ?
What are you doing for me ?
There &apos;s reason to believe that it &apos;s true this approach .
Sociologists like we spend a lot of time or other people , the odds .
We make sure that it &apos;s going to harm the body of body language .
And the fact that they are able to predicting important understanding in life like who who we hire or encouraged or not to make an argument .
For example , I graduated from Gaphlal , a researcher at Kuwait University , said that when somebody sees 30 seconds of videos are not from traditional interactions with real social interactions , that doctor &apos;s going to be taken or not .
So it doesn &apos;t have to see so much so much with the doctor &apos;s doctor or not inconsistencies , but it &apos;s not incompetent .
And even more dramatic , Alex Tommpv , from Princeton , shown in which the ultimate judgments of the political candidates have provided in a second to 70 percent of the outcome of the career and the Senate &apos;s Senate and even in the middle of the digital candidates , and the USA of the United States , and even in the middle of the world , the brain has been used to respect the most value of that .
If you do it wrong , you don &apos;t know ?
Mind language &apos;s talk is talking about how we have to have other people , like us , and what are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other audience where our language are not verbal , but we are .
Changing our language are not verbal , our thoughts and the physiology .
What does language do I mean ?
I &apos;m a social scientist . I study the social-evaluative judgments and I teach them in a competitive deal of business , so it was inevitable that I was interested in the dynamics of power .
I &apos;ve been excited about all of me , but it &apos;s not necessary .
What are the essence , don &apos;t matter of power ?
Well , this is .
And in the animal kingdom they have to look at the expansion , and in the animal kingdom they have to look at the expansion .
So , as soon as we run , we were going to be able to take a lot of , kind of like , stop , stop space .
It &apos;s going to open up .
And it works in all the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , and it works in the animal kingdom , and it works in the animal kingdom , and it works in the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , the animal kingdom , and it
We don &apos;t just limit the standard .
Humans do the same . ( Laughter ) They like that when they &apos;re in a permanent way , they also feel powerful at the moment .
So this is especially interesting because we were ancient and universal , and that &apos;s why this is the essence of power .
This expression , known as a matter , was study by Jessica Reed , and it &apos;s been studied by Jessica Reed , and this phrase , &quot; &quot; I know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s been studied
Which tells us that so the people who tell us that as much as the people who are , they think that as much as the people who are blind , they &apos;re doing the same when the people who are going to have a physical competition .
So when you go back to the goal of getting and win , you don &apos;t care if you never saw any one .
Like it .
The arms dropped in , and the cheese was very high .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We do the opposite .
We &apos;re closed . We &apos;ll get there .
We are small .
We don &apos;t want to lay out to our own .
And so animals like humans do the same thing .
And this is what happens when we make it all the way .
What we tend to do when it comes to power is to acquire language &apos;s verbal language .
So if somebody show very powerful with us , we tend to get smaller . We don &apos;t eat it .
We do the opposite .
If I see this behavior in class , what do you notice ?
We launched the students from the MBA language to be the whole language of power .
There are people who are in the middle of the ages , entering the same before they start to start class , how they wanted to take space .
When they sit there , they seem spreading .
They take your hand like this .
So there are other people who get very high .
It goes on your face and your body , sit in the chair , and do it when you run the hand , and do it when you put your hand .
So here I look at two things .
One is not going to sign you .
I had to think about sex .
The women are more likely to do it than men .
The women always count are always powerful with men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that it seems to be linked to the third of the students and his level level .
And this is really important in the class of the MBA , because it belongs to the media .
Business schools have been fighting for the baseline for the second .
They are women and men equally , and then you see these differences in the notes , that seem to be attributed to a portion of the adoption .
So I started asking myself : if there are people who come together with that attitude and <unk> bread , if there are people who come together with that attitude and you are bread , if there are people who come together with that attitude and you are bread , if there are people who come together with that attitude and you are bread , if there are people who come together with that attitude and you are bread , if there are people who come together with that attitude and you are bread , if there are people
Wouldn &apos;t it be possible to do something else to do it that others are going to be able to do something else , and that would make it better ?
My novel , Jama Carney , who is in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can go to it .
I mean , you can do it just for a moment and experiment a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language is not verbal , namely what other people feel and think of us , there &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question was : Does our question is , doesn &apos;t matter what we feel and think of ourselves ?
There &apos;s evidence that this is .
For example , we guessed it when we are told , but also when we take us laughing at it as well , it makes it impossible .
It works in the two direct .
When it comes to power , it also works in the two direct .
When we feel powerful , we &apos;re really likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we dare to be powerful enough that we really feel powerful .
Well , the second question was , well , we already know that the mind stays your body , but it &apos;s right also that the body will make our mind ?
And when I say , in the case of the powerful , what I &apos;m talking about ?
Well , I talk to my thoughts and feelings of cognition that make these thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about the hormones .
How is the mind of the powerful mind compared to what they are ?
The powerful people tend to be , isn &apos;t surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s safe .
They have the feeling that they &apos;re going to win even if they &apos;re really games .
We also tend to think about a more abstract way .
There &apos;s a lot of difference . &quot; &quot; So there &apos;s a lot more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of difference among the powerful things that are powerful .
It &apos;s physically also if you give two key hormones in two key hormones : testosterone , which is the dominated of the dominated , and cutting it , which is the stress hormone .
The males with a lot of power in the CPU mechanism has high levels of testosterone and levels of powerful leaders , and the powerful leaders and effective global leaders . And the powerful leaders and the effective leaders and the effective leaders and the effective leaders of the <unk> <unk> . And the powerful leaders and the effective leaders and the effective leaders of it . And the powerful leaders and the effective leaders and the effective leaders and the effective leaders of it . And the powerful leaders and the effective leaders and the effective leaders of
What does this mean ? To talk about power , it &apos;s used to talk only about testosterone , because I had to see it in the trouble .
But the power also has to see the stress of stress .
We want a dominant leader , with high levels of testosterone , but sensitive to stress ?
It &apos;s probably not true ?
We want a person who is powerful , and the dominant and the dominant , but not very sensitive to stress , a person who &apos;s quiet .
We know that in the subtle , you know , if you have an apple has to take control , if somebody has to take control , you suddenly have to take control , you suddenly have a lot of paper , its testosterone in a lot of time .
We have that evidence , that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also the role of our own mind .
So what happens when you think about a paper change , what will happen if you make a minimum level , like this little manipulator ?
We call it &quot; &quot; I want for two minutes . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to overcome people to the laboratory and make a little experiment , these people , for two minutes , both of the movements , of power or guilt , and I &apos;m going to show you just five of those scenes , even if they were just two .
This is one .
One more couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more to a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more than a couple more .
The media was calling &quot; &quot; Our Final Hour . &quot; &quot; And this is the media .
So here we have a couple more .
You can be standing , or sitting .
So here &apos;s the surgical surplus .
Now , baldness , you go small .
This is very low power .
When you think about the nihilism you &apos;re growing up , really .
This is what happens .
They come up , hangs out in a jar , and they said , for two minutes , you have to do this or it . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the compositions photo .
We don &apos;t want to break it with one concept of power .
We want to feel the power .
You do this two minutes .
So we asked , &quot; &quot; How do we change your mind ? &quot; &quot; then we gave them the chance to go back and end up again .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experiment .
This was what we found .
Take the risk , you bet , found that when they &apos;re in a high school position to get the 86 percent .
When they are in the lower space , just 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s see what we found with testosterone .
It &apos;s based on his normal situation to arrive , the powerful people that have a massive increase of the 20 percent , and we &apos;re trying to take 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and you get there .
Now the results with breathtaking .
And the most powerful experience , a 25 percent increase , the most salient rise of an increased scale .
There are only two minutes going to make these hormonal changes that you &apos;re trying to make your brain to make it extra , secure or width , or whatever it means to stress .
We all know that feeling , right ?
What our language are not verbal , the way we care about ourselves , not just too long , but we know it .
The body can change the mind .
So the next question , of course , is — can we make this of power in a minute to change our life differently ?
This is in the laboratory , this experiment , it &apos;s just two minutes .
Where can we really apply this ?
That &apos;s what you care about .
We think that where you need is where you &apos;re going to be in the position of you , you &apos;re going to be able to adapt , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how you &apos;re going to , how do you get it
You &apos;ll see your friends .
For adolescents is at the table of the washing off .
To some people is talking about the Southern school .
It can be to the opening of one Business or giving a talk of work .
We took one that most people realized because a lot of it was , the job interview .
So we publish results , and then we publish it , and he said — well , this is what you have to do when you go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we have stopped , and we said , &quot; No , no , no , no . &quot;
For many of it , I don &apos;t face it .
Again , it &apos;s not about talking to other people .
You can talk to you .
What do you do before you go to an interview interview ?
You are sitting . Oh , my iPhone — or Android , we won &apos;t let anybody out .
Take your text messages , you &apos;re bad sympathy , when you really know what you should be doing is this , maybe in the agrarian , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . I &apos;ll see two minutes .
So that &apos;s what we want to judge , right ?
We invited people to the laboratory , and adopted and forth and down and down and forth again , we found an interview interview in the lab , and then they built an interview interview again .
From five minutes away .
It &apos;s also about guidance , and the police are confronted by not giving it a minute .
Imagine that person in the interview .
For five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than any of you .
People are all disgusted .
It &apos;s what Marianne &apos;s supposed to be in the face of &quot; &quot; to be in the &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; the social . &quot; &quot; This is fire .
This is the interview that we overlap , because we wanted to see what happened .
We have analysts looking at the top , four in total .
They don &apos;t know the hypothesis . I don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have the idea that when you take each person and end up taking all of these noises , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , all of the actions of power .
We don &apos;t want to hire other .
So we put a much more positive savings in general . What was happening ?
It &apos;s not about the value of speech .
This is the presence of the presence of the presence .
Why do we measure all of these variations of meaning to the foundation : Would we change the speech ?
Have you wondered ? What are you ratings ?
These things don &apos;t affect . That &apos;s what it affects .
This kind of stuff .
Each person touches itself , basically .
They say what they are .
They brought their ideas together by themselves without any extra .
So this is what it does or interpret it .
When I talk to people about this , that our bodies changes our mind and behavior can change our way to be , &quot; &quot; It seems obvious . &quot; &quot; Oh yeah ?
I mean , I mean , that &apos;s the gas .
I don &apos;t want it .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an imposture .
I don &apos;t want to get there to be there to feel that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is really important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an imposture and you felt like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
When I was 19 or 19 years old , I was a car accident .
I bought him to him and I gave a few notes .
I bought off the car .
I waited in intensive care of my head . I take me from university , and I was told that my CSS had had two warning . It was very helpful .
I know it &apos;s my IQ because they &apos;re going to be cured , and I think I was a little girl .
So I went from university and tried back back .
I said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to end the career .
You have to accept that there are other things you can do , but in your case this doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; I had to deal with it , and I have to say that , and I have to say that , and I have to say that , and I have to say that for me was to be smart , that it &apos;s the thing that &apos;s more helpless you can do .
I felt completely helpless .
So I worked and worked , and I had smiles , and I worked lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was lucky , and I was
I finally graduated university .
I gave up four more years to my fellows , and I &apos;ve got to convince somebody , my fellow inmates , Rachel Oliver , who became , and eventually on Princeton , I felt like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The night before I graduated from the middle of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course , the night from the middle of the course , the night from the ninth grade , the night from the ninth course of the course , the night from the ninth course of the course , the night from the ninth course of the course , the night from the ninth course of the course , the night from the ninth course of the course , the night from the ninth course
That &apos;s like .
I had so much fun of the worm left the next day I was calling , and I said , &quot; &quot; Let me stop you . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to let me , because I put it on you and you go .
You see , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;re doing all the bispiders that are going on .
It &apos;s just to do it , and do it , and make it , even though it &apos;s frightened of them or even paralyzed and having experienced the time , until it comes to the moment that &quot; &quot; Finding Nemo , &quot; &quot; until it comes to the moment .
I came up here . I &apos;m doing it now . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years ago I learned a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago , you know , in the Northwest Passage , I turn to Harvard , I &apos;m not thinking about it , but for a long time I had the feeling I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
So the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who hadn &apos;t talked to in the entire semester of the entire semester , and that he said , &quot; &quot; Look , you have to participate in , you &apos;ll be able to participate in , and I don &apos;t know before .
Totally defeated , I said , &quot; &quot; I should not be here .
That was my moment .
Because he took two things .
The first one I &apos;ve told me : boy . I don &apos;t feel it .
I didn &apos;t feel like it , but she can and he can hold his place .
The second was , of course , must be here !
We &apos;re going to stop it and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes . Yes .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s going to happen , you &apos;re going to make it powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) ( Applause ) You &apos;ll see the best speech , and you know what — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) You &apos;ll see the best speech of all of you , and I learned that I don &apos;t really care about it . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve done a couple of months later , and I learned that I don &apos;t care about it , but
It changed a way .
Now I want to tell you that there &apos;s no way to do it .
We have to stop it .
We have to do it too long until it &apos;s going to turn it into it .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
Little changes can lead to the great transformation .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
Before I had to come back to the next situation where I went to you for two minutes , trying this , trying to do this , at the same time , trying to do this , at the end of the painting , in the 18th century , when you go back to two minutes , trying to do this , in the middle of a few minutes , trying to do this , in a way , try to do this , in a way , try to do this , in a way , try this
This is what you have to do .
And then the brain is able to get the best of that situation .
There &apos;s a testosterone to testosterone .
You wouldn &apos;t have that situation when I didn &apos;t show you who I showed you who are .
I remember this situation with the feeling that I &apos;m going to say who I &apos;m going to say , and I &apos;m flying it .
I want to ask you before anything you adopt a position of power , and I also want to give you the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) So I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you , I showed you
I remember it with them because they can do it in private .
They only need their bodies , privacy and two minutes to change the journey of his life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The Triptych . &quot; &quot; — probably it &apos;s a good option .
( Laughter ) First of all , I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s the big problem in the world ?
And I should say , before I go on , ask every one of you who get you to get familiar and paper because I &apos;m going to ask you to help you see how we do it .
So he roiz and paper .
After all , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world outside there .
I &apos;m going to list some .
800 million people go out of hunger .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to water .
Two billion without sanitation .
Several million people died of HIV and AIDS .
The continental lists .
Two billion people that have been seriously affected by the climate change — and <unk> .
We have many , many problems there .
In a ideal world , we would solve everybody , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question I think we should do — and that &apos;s why we are in the middle of the economy — is saying , if we don &apos;t really do it all , we really need to start asking ourselves , what are we going to solve first ?
That &apos;s the question I wish I would ask .
If you have to say , 50 billion dollars to spend in the next four years to make this world , what would we spend ?
We &apos;ve identified 10 of the most big challenges of the world , and just just read it . &quot; &quot; We change climate change , including post-traumatic stress disorder , post-traumatic education disorder , sanitation , finance , education , finance , sanitation , movements and water supplies , sanitation and walls and walls and walls and buffers and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and walls and
We think these are in a lot of ways , very high risk of the world .
So , the problem would you see would be wondering , what do you think are the greatest ?
Why should we start solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s wonder about a real problem .
Well , that was the punchline , and that was the story of what we talked about .
But let &apos;s try to get a problem , there &apos;s a problem if you ask people to focus on the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
You probably have the biggest problem that we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we are ?
So the problem is not to prioritize the problems , but they &apos;re constantly giving the solutions to the problems .
And then it was , of course , it &apos;s a little more complicated .
To change climate change , it would be something like Kya .
For diseases , it could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
To the conflict , it would be the forces of the U.N. , and so we could go on .
What I would like to ask you to try to do , and that &apos;s about 30 seconds — and I know it &apos;s kind of impossible — writing what you think are , you know what you think are the greatest priorities .
And also — in this case , there is , naturally , where the economy goes down — write what we would not want to do .
What should be the end of the list ?
So please , it &apos;s just about 30 seconds , perhaps speaking to people , and you just imagine what should they should be the primary priorities and the least ones of the solutions that we have for the world world .
Now , the striking process of this process — of course , I mean , I would say , I would have to say — I would only have 18 minutes to you , right ?
I &apos;d like to <unk> <unk> , and make me think about this process , and that &apos;s what we really did .
And I also recommend it , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m safe , and I &apos;m
So , since then , you have to ask yourself , why would you have done a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the progression is incredible .
Nobody wants to do it .
Of course , all the organizations would want to be at the top of a list like that .
But they also all accepted that they would need not to be at the highest .
And there &apos;s a lot more , but there &apos;s a lot more things that numbers like this .
There &apos;s 60 years that exists in the United States , and it &apos;s still not going to have a basic list of the big things we can do in the world , and said , well , what would we do first ?
This means that we don &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not going to — every decision is a place , so despite the fact that it &apos;s not just about it , and it &apos;s not surprising that it &apos;s so good for it , and it &apos;s not surprising that it &apos;s so good that if we really did it , and we were laughing at that .
So what I &apos;m saying is that we had , for a long period of time , a very long period of time , a situation where there were multiple choices .
There &apos;s a lot , many things we can do right there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , and the ones .
We had no idea .
Imagine that in a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the prices are .
You know you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a doler , could be 1,000 dollars .
Could it be a familiar pizza . Could it be an individual pizza , right ?
We want to know these things .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s trying to do is to make the precursor sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> - to put the prices of these subjects .
And so it basically , this was the process of the precursor of Co<unk> <unk> .
We have 30 of the best economists in the world three of every area .
So so we have to prioritize three of the greatest economists on the planet to think about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be their cost ? What &apos;s their cost ?
The same with conversion disorder .
Three of the best experts say , what can we do ?
What is the price ?
What would we do about that , and what would it be ?
And so forth .
So we took some of the greatest scientific economists , eight of the greatest economists in the world , including three Nobel laureates in 2004 , put it in the U.S.
So we call it &quot; &quot; agagles . &quot; &quot; The stakes from Ed University are supposed to call them the Real AM .
It works very well in Europe , but there &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did , it was a list of poems .
And then you ask you , why economists ?
And then , of course , I &apos;m so happy that I &apos;m going to get that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The topic is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , questions about malaria .
If you want to know about the weather , you ask a clip .
But if you want to know what the two might solve you first , you can &apos;t ask any of the two things , because it &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what makes economists .
They knew .
So , that frees something strange , and we have to do it first , and we need to do it .
So this is the list , and this is the list I want to share with you .
Now , of course , you can see on the web , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;re going to talk about this as a day .
So we found that there were a list in which they said that they were going to work together — basically projects where we would take a dol-head , and they &apos;re going to be less than a result .
They were the right projects , the good , the good .
And of course , they are very powerful projects we should begin by doing .
I &apos;m going to start since the last way we can end with the best projects .
These were bad .
As you can see the end of the list is changing climate change .
( Laughter ) Now , this shortage of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things that people will say they shouldn &apos;t go back .
And I &apos;d like to talk about it , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why came out ?
And the fact , I also try to talk to again about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things we don &apos;t need to agree with lists of lists .
And the reason it turned out to say this is by Kaggle , or doing something more than Gertrude Stein — is not a good business just because it &apos;s very inefficient .
I &apos;m not saying there is global global warming .
It &apos;s not a big problem .
But that &apos;s what we can do that &apos;s very little , a very high cost .
What we found in show is the media from all the secular models , and Kychoa , if all the world has reached , would cost a billion billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Two or three times the global aid help to the development of every year .
And to do it very little .
And all of the models show you what it &apos;s going to take care of about six years ago .
So a type in Bangladesh that &apos;s used to have a flooded to 2100 can hope for 210 .
What &apos;s wrong , but not very good .
So the idea and saying , well we spend a lot of money doing something good .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that the majority of that amount , about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the basic problems in the world .
We could make clean water clean water , sanitation , basic education and education to all human beings .
So we should ask ourselves , we want to spend twice a little bit ?
Or half the half of doing something really is good ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out that it turns out on a bad project .
We &apos;re not saying that we have all the money in the world , we don &apos;t want to do it .
First of all , when we don &apos;t have the first one , it &apos;s not our first priority .
The right projects — I &apos;m not going to comment on all — I &apos;m not going to comment on it , but it sounds strange , just a little bit , just a little bit , just a little bit , just because , it &apos;s just a little bit .
It would be a lot of good , but it &apos;s also a lot , but it &apos;s very easy .
Again , what we did and suddenly started thinking about two sides of the equation .
If you look at the great projects , there &apos;s a lot of sanitation projects .
Again , sanitation and water is incredible , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four wonderful national occupations that should be , when least , the first that we solve when we talk about how to solve the problems of the world .
The fourth ever tested is malaria — treating malaria .
The malaria gap is about a couple of millions of people infected every year .
It could even cost a wider point of GDP per year for the past year .
If it &apos;s invested in a thousand billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce the OPEC .
We could prevent death 55,000 people , but what perhaps perhaps is , we could avoid a billion people infected every year .
We would want to be measured by his ability to address many of the other problems that we face , of course , in the long run , and also the reapting of global warming .
The third one is free .
Basically , the model showed that if we were able to reach the free range , and especially by measuring the victims of the USA and Europe , we could basically rise the global economy of the United States and Europe , and we could basically put the global economy into the Third World .
Again , we could really take 200 or 300 million people of poverty , radically and faster , and very quickly , between two and five years .
That would be the third thing we could do .
The second one is going to be trained in malnutrition .
They don &apos;t mean they haven &apos;t expected to have a very economic way to deal with malnutrition , is saying , the lack of self-sufficiency .
Basically , half of the world &apos;s population has stopped the island of iron , and vitamin D .
If you invest 12 billion dollars , we could make a profound achievement in that problem .
This would be the second imperative we could do .
And the best project would be measured in HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could potentially avoid 28 million new cases of AIDS .
Again , what this makes it and what &apos;s going to mean is that we have two different ways of treating HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment and the other is the invention .
Again , in a ideal world , we would make two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t make any of the two or where we didn &apos;t do it well , we would be able to invest first .
And treatment is a lot more expensive .
So this is what this is saying that we can do a lot more investing in it .
Basically , for the amount of money that we &apos;ve used to do , we can do X on treatment , and 10 times more likely .
So once we think more , we need to focus on it more than treatment , as the first option .
What this does is it really makes us think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like you to look at your list of habits , and you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , do you get it right ?
Have you ever come to you to do something like what we &apos;ve done here ?
Well , popular German , one of the things is again changing climate change .
And a lot of people think it &apos;s very , but it &apos;s very unlikely that we did that .
We &apos;ve also allowed climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t solve all the adopters .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if you focus on problems , you care the most right thing .
We can do a lot more good than little .
And I think , the truth — Thomas Schrling , one of the audience , one of the audience , said , very well .
One of the things that people make life , and in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of climate change , people will be much richer .
Even though the early adopters impacts the U.N.
What a person in the developing world in the developing world have been as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , they &apos;re just two to four times more rich than we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
But the problem is , when we talk about saving people in Bangladesh , we &apos;re not talking about a without talking of a poor trailer .
We &apos;re talking about a fairly rich female kid .
And so the real topic , of course , is that we want to spend a lot of money helping a little bit , to a couple of years , a fairly rich world ?
How can we help the poor people , or we want to help the poor people , in particular , in Bangladesh , who really needs help , and who can help us overcome it ?
Or as he said , let &apos;s imagine the rich , imagine that rich — as will happen — a wealthy man , a wealthy man , a wealthy year of a rich in the world , and saying , &quot; &quot; What do you really need to care so much better for me to change climate change , and that would need a lot more ? &quot; &quot; So I think what we really need to do is we need our priorities in order to make our grandmother , and we need much more ? &quot; &quot; So
Even if you don &apos;t agree with a typical way to see this problem .
And of course , that &apos;s fundamentally because the climate change has a very good photo .
You know we have &quot; &quot; El Day &quot; &quot; — it seems great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the meaning of what I want to see you , right , but I don &apos;t think I don &apos;t believe it , but I don &apos;t think I don &apos;t believe it , but I don &apos;t think I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a movie .
So in a lot of ways , I think it &apos;s most ways , and all of course about our priorities of the priorities of our priorities is an defensive problem .
And to make sure it &apos;s not just that way , it &apos;s not just to be able to feel good , but to make sure that it &apos;s not just to make it possible , it &apos;s not just to be able to feel good .
So it &apos;s not going to do the things that have the greatest compelling things about doing things that have the greatest compelling assumption , but it &apos;s also going to be about making places where we can actually make a bigger .
The other objection , I think , that matter , that matter , that &apos;s what I &apos;m — or we are — we &apos;re showing a false deal of forged encryption .
Of course we have to do it all , in a ideal world — it would be completely out .
I think we should do all the things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In the 1970 , the developed world decided that we were going to spend twice what we did right now , right now , in the 1970s .
Like our help get rid of half .
We don &apos;t think we &apos;re in the way to solve all of the great problems .
In the same way , people also say , but what about the war of Iraq ?
You know , we &apos;re going to spend 100 billion . Why don &apos;t we spend it in the world .
I &apos;m pretty sure .
If some of you can talk to the Bush so that it &apos;s okay .
But of course , the theme is still saying , if you have the other 100 billion dollars , it &apos;s still going to be a little bit of the best possible way , right ?
So the real problem , it &apos;s beginning to start and think about what the proper priorities .
I should mention briefly , is this really going to the right list ?
You know , when you ask the best economists in the world , you &apos;ll end up by asking these white men and old men from the U.S.
And they &apos;re not necessarily a really good way to look at the whole world .
So we invited the 80 hales of the world to solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying in university , and they talked English .
Most of them were , first in the developing world .
They had the same material material , but they could get away from that way , but they could actually make their own lists .
And the striking thing was that the list was very similarly — with malnutrition and disease at the bottom of the end .
We have done this many other times .
There were many other people and students and university students and things .
They all had the same list as a list .
And that &apos;s a great hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a way forward to start thinking about our priorities . And saying , what is the most important thing about the world ?
Of course , in a ideal world , I would love to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do it all , we can start thinking about where we start ?
I see the Confucius of Co<unk> a way as a process .
We &apos;ve done this in 2004 , and we hope back to a lot more people , to get a lot better data in 2008 .
I dream the way right for the world . But also to start thinking about it .
To start thinking about saying , we don &apos;t make things that little bit high cost , and the things that we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we do make wonderful things that we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we do make wonderful things that we can really do , but we have to be honest with it , but we have to be honest and saying , if there &apos;s a lot of things we do , we have others we don &apos;t do .
If we care a lot about some things , we &apos;ll end up with no other things .
So I hope that I hope helps us to make better change , and think about how we work better for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I was running out of the house without keys .
I &apos;m just going to come home to the house to visit a friend by the other side of the city , because that temperature contains two scales .
And I was in lithium , searching in the pocket , and I realized I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , he could see the window by the window of the washing of water , where she had stopped .
But they were all closed .
I couldn &apos;t see it in the house of my friend &apos;s house , because the morning he had a flight to Europe , and I would need to do it safe .
So , I hope , and she &apos;s going to sit cold , and then I pasted it in the window to get it out of the window .
I &apos;m going to cost a lot of money , but they didn &apos;t even feel a little bit more money .
Well , I &apos;m going to give you an science to science , and I &apos;m going to give you a sense of science .
It sheds a lot , which elevates the heart rate of lifespan every time .
So by the next morning when I went to sleep , I worried through the window , and I teamed up with the window and I started to have in Europe had the privilege of the <unk> uda &apos;s mind .
And until arriving at the airport , I didn &apos;t forget that it was the passport .
So I went back quickly to the house , with snow and ice , and in 40 minutes , I went back to the airport , and I &apos;m going to take my head to the other person &apos;s hand , but let me take my hand to another person .
Or , in the case of that , there &apos;s no bad news .
And so it tells me , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you , and so it tells me , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you , and it tells me I &apos;m going to tell you
It was something that &apos;s created from the psychologist &apos;s psychologist who wrote a few years ago , and that was also a few years ago , and it &apos;s also called it .
A team of experts get a team of experts that &apos;s trying to determine what happened , right ?
And then you live , like it &apos;s explained , and then you try to determine what you can do what you can do .
What I want to talk about today is what we can do today .
A few things are going to make it easier .
I &apos;m going to start to avoid it .
We exhibit places all around the house for things that are easily .
Well , this seems kind of common sense , and it &apos;s like that &apos;s like this , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of important things , and where they can catch fish , where they live the tribes and the enemy .
And the hippocampus is the part of the brain in the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain in the brain .
In fact , there &apos;s been somebody who did the experiment to cut it out of the way the way the way the way the way the audience was the way the way the way that he works .
But it works well with things that you don &apos;t see too much , and it doesn &apos;t look at it .
So there &apos;s so far that there &apos;s a place to the keys .
To go , a specific mug , a specific mug .
If it turned out to a place and it &apos;s moist , it &apos;s going to be in your place when we &apos;re looking at it .
And when we traveled out , we had a photo with the mobile device .
Take an email from an email to kick .
These are seem to be attracted to .
You remember that when you &apos;re under stress , the brain emits it .
The cut is toxic , and the mind .
You recognize that there are also some stresses that are not going to be able to make the best of you , and you should make some system .
that when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision that when you &apos;re confronted with a decision of a medical decision .
We &apos;re all going to be somewhere in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a
And I want to talk about it .
Or any decision that we need to do is or any decision that we need to do to make a choice or any decision that we need to do that we need to do it , or any decision that we need to do that we need to do it or any decision that we need to do .
So let &apos;s say that you go to the doctor , and this says &quot; &quot; I have the results of the test , and it has a little bit high . &quot;
You know the cholesterol cholesterol was high .
And you &apos;ll be thinking that having the primary cholesterol is not very good . And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want you to care a drug , you don &apos;t care , and you know it &apos;s one of the medicines of drugs and you know that they are one of the medicines that are one of the medicines . &quot; &quot; I mean , I think I had a medication .
You should ask a statistic .
It &apos;s the number to deal with &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s the number .
It &apos;s number one number of people who have to take it before we help a person .
And we think of what point of statistics is that ?
The number one should be one . My doctor didn &apos;t care .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
We don &apos;t know a lot of good mechanisms .
Red Kinsey estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So at the end of the level of the Koran , what do you think is ?
How many people have the suitcase before you help somebody ?
So this second , the results of the results that this second is the results of the results that this second is the results of the results of this second , and this second , the results of the results , and this second , the results of the results that this second is the results of the results of this second , and this second , the results of the results that this second is the results of the results of this second , and this second , the results of the results that this second is the
I even tested the data .
( Laughter ) And you think you &apos;ll be able to be able to let you , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you think you &apos;ll be able to imagine , and you

And I tend to change things too . &quot; &quot; And we change in the muscles and the rest of me , and I don &apos;t think , &quot; &quot; One five % . I don &apos;t think it &apos;s me .
You have 15 times more likely than the drug medicine and the weed .
I &apos;m not saying if you were going to make it open or not .
We should have this conversation with your doctor .
You know , you can get access to this information to speak to you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to speak to you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to you about you to talk to
I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact , at the &apos; academic , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact , at the &apos; academic , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact , MNT said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles , but in fact , I &apos;m talking about this number to smiles .
For prostate cancer , the prostate cancer is 49 .
Yes , there &apos;s going to be able to do that by every person who helps .
And the side effects are in this case by 50 percent of the patients .
They tend to blame , they become full , incontinence .
So the idea of time is it &apos;s going to be the conversation .
The ideal is not having to create this in the moment .
We also have to think about subjects like the quality of life .
They are things we have to think about now and talk to the family and .
You remember the : underneath stress the brain emits it , and one of the things that &apos;s happening in that moment is that it goes a lot of systems .
Evolution to make it .
Because if the body got downgraded into these things , it &apos;s because if the body has formed these things , and we don &apos;t really limit quickly , because if the body has made it all these things together and we don &apos;t really limit fast .
I mean , one of the things you &apos;re going to see is that the things that have shown how it evolves and their colleagues .
So we need training to be able to think about anti<unk> on this type of land .
I think the most important thing is recognize that we all have momentum .
We &apos;re going to be wrong .
So the idea is to think antithtation in what they can be wrong , to establish systems that can minimize the damage or just to avoid those things are bad .
So by looking at that night , I was able to see that night with the front of the door of the door of the house of the house and an easy code of remember .
They &apos;re not totally organized to make it not completely organized .
The day .
Are they free ?
Anybody ? No . Well , no .
&quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Look , how do you look like that ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about it .
You see , you see me , you see me like this ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Look , you see it .
It seemed boring by having to talk to me , but it seemed boring by having to talk to me .
And just a word did that a young man who was a little boy who was a young man who was a young man who was a young man who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a little boy who was a young man
How can you talk that ?
So I started thinking about it .
I and a lot .
So how do we get there ?
Right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right now right now , right

Language is not one , two or three words or letters put out .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , if you were a son , or if your son goes and you say , &quot; &quot; Be English , &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll see when people were going on the street saying , &quot; &quot; Do you live on English ?
How would you feel that ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , it &apos;s better off stop and stop talking to you .
What I mean , what I mean is that these express us in a particular trend .
I have a friend who &apos;s talking to the French man who got married .
One time I asked her all .
And I told me , &quot; &quot; All right , but once I spent the entire night trying to figure out how to make it all the way out there were the way I had .
So let her not tell her that she &apos;s telling his husband , and it &apos;s normal he didn &apos;t understand it ; his way of thinking is different .
She also said , &quot; &quot; He tells me , &quot; &quot; he tells me , &quot; &quot; he tells me , and one night , I tried translated into it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know my hands and we stole it . &quot; &quot; He had tried to read his hands , and he stole my hands and stole it into it , and he says , &quot; &quot; ... I bought my hands and stole them . &quot;
( Applause ) Well , what we did for our Arab language ?
We try to negotiate the civil society , but we try to make the civil society .
( Laughter ) Even a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Why do you care ?
( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think there &apos;s a question
At the campaign to preserve the Arab Arab to the next year : the next year : the next year , the next year , the next year .
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; No . We didn &apos;t have to shave this style , because that way we can &apos;t understand it .
And when somebody speaks about it , I hate Arabic .
We &apos;re going to ... ( Applause ) So we want to change our reality , and to be convinced that our dreams , aspirations and day .
We have to view how we think we think .
After that we were going to take pictures of young men and girls with Arabic characters .
( Laughter ) Famous groups of young people and girls are .
We are very , very hard . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t we . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Are we very happy ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Are we very happy ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t we . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Are we very happy ?
And any one says , &quot; &quot; Hey , I used a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No . I adopted the word &quot; &quot; thighs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ll then say , &quot; &quot; Internet .
If you think you have authority on us , what will you do with us , what will we do with us , what will we do for us , what will we do for our language , what will we do for our language ?
The creativity in language is the way .
So let &apos;s start from right now .
One sounds that sounds different and global .
It could take the Arabic back to the bottom .
But we have to know it , and I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a solution , and we have the chance to be part of it .
So in short , what can we do here ?
Let &apos;s zoom in — and who &apos;s out there ?
Please , of course , I &apos;m still going to , even my time .
But they didn &apos;t want to write in Arabic with radio characters .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a bit like this . It &apos;s not a language .
They could take on a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back to that world and gossip .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
The babies identified first by their father first to their father &apos;s father .
So when you were born in my daughter , I will say , &quot; &quot; This is Daddy , my band . &quot; &quot; And I like a faith that I don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; Thel &apos;s &quot; &quot; .
What is it happening in the mind of a baby ?
If we ask about this about 30 years , most of the people , we would say that this baby is irrational , and we would say this baby is irrational , and it wouldn &apos;t be in account for somebody else &apos;s angle or not to understand a effect .
For the last 20 years , the science of the development of the development of the developing theory .
So in a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of science .
This is an example of this .
One thing that might be thinking this baby is going to think this baby , which could be happening by its head , is to address what &apos;s happening in another baby .
And finally , one of the most difficult things for all of us is to address what other people think of and feel .
And maybe the most difficult thing is to understand that what others think and feel is not the same as we think and feel .
I mean , anybody who &apos;s so much of the politics can say the hard to do this .
We wanted to know if babies and kids could understand this very complex idea of other people .
So , the question is , how can we ask ourselves ?
The babies don &apos;t talk , and if we ask a three-year-old child who tells us that they think , only we &apos;ll be able to make a documentary about it , to be asked by years and things like .
So how can we wonder ?
It turns out that the secret was broccoli .
Beth Ride , one of my students , and most of me , gave babies two dishes with food — one with broccoli , and another one with a nice mustache .
Every baby babies , even in Berkeley , would like you like , you know , you don &apos;t like the broccoli .
( Laughter ) Next , what he was going to count was a food company .
And he said he loved it or not what he tested .
Half of the time , he did it , he said , &quot; &quot; I want you to enjoy the way that you would like to wear , and you don &apos;t like it .
But the other half , they took a little bit of broccoli and he said , &quot; &quot; M<unk> , broccoli .
I put broccoli . M<unk> .
I looked at the burrow . Ahhel : Yes . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just like you &apos;d like the opposite of what you loved the babies .
We did this with thousands and 18 months .
And then finally , she would say , &quot; Would you like me a little little girl ? &quot;
The question was : Do babies the babies , what would they like them ?
The striking thing was that babies of 18 months , who was going to start walking and talked to them , and talked to the dog , would you like you to sit down and the broccoli .
On the other hand , the babies of 15 months were going to sit down to her , and she looked like she loved the broccoli , like he couldn &apos;t understand it .
And then I would look after it for a long time , put it in a long way , and thought , &quot; &quot; We would like to go the whole world .
So there &apos;s two main data revealed this .
So one side is that the babies of 18 months have to discover this important assumption of human nature : we don &apos;t all want the same thing .
It &apos;s more , you understand that you can take action to help other people who burn it .
And more interesting , though , is that babies from 15 months are not doing this ; what do the kids of 18 months are doing this profound act of being age in three months that &apos;s separated from the time of 15 months .
So babies know more and they learn more than we do .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that came in the last 20 years showing this fact .
What can we ask is , why are kids learning so much ?
And how do you learn so much too little ?
I mean , the first view , babies seem a lot like me .
And in many times , it &apos;s worse than it &apos;s going through , because we have to use a lot of time and energy just continuing alive .
If we prioritize evolution to look at this mystery , the mystery of why we lost so much time taking a lot of time with babies , it turns out that there &apos;s an answer .
So if you look at some different species , you can &apos;t only be able to , but it &apos;s also not only one single prime species like us , but it &apos;s also the way that it &apos;s going to , but it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between the space of childhood , and the relative size of the brain and intelligence and the flexibility in the species .
So here &apos;s an example of this , these birds that you can see here .
So a band of band we have to give up from New Cal<unk> .
The corps and the other circle , like , paste , are the very intelligent birds .
Just like the chimpanzees are as smart as the chimpanzees .
And this is a pet scientist who has learned using tools to get food .
On the other hand , we have our ancestors .
So you go , like the ducks , just like ducks , paste you , are kind of like stones .
I &apos;m very excited about it , but I &apos;m not very good at doing anything else .
And it turns out that babies from New Yorkers are the ones , the ones you had .
They depend on that their momagles worms to send the worms to the two years of life , which means a lot of time in the short life of a patient .
Today , the sharecropper are adult in just a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why you &apos;re going to tell you so much of the scientific journals that you &apos;re going to do so that you &apos;re going to go through the scientific journals and the soup .
There &apos;s something in the long run that seems to be related to knowledge and learning .
What could we have to do this ?
Some animals , like the pink , seem to make a very good thing .
So what we would do is it &apos;s very good to save a new environment .
Other creatures , like the speaker , are not particularly good doing anything particular , but they &apos;re very good learning learning things differently .
And of course , we humans are actually far far away in that adoption .
We have more brains with our bodies , much more than any other animal .
More intelligent , more significantly , we can learn more , we can survive , and we have migrate by all the planet , and even space .
Our babies and children depend on us for a long time that babies from other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) At least , until the 23 , we still keep calling them the same way in their mouths .
Okay , why do we look at this simulation ?
One idea is , that strategy was , the strategy , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way of going into this world , and it has a huge disconnect .
And it turns out that if it learns everything , if it &apos;s inadequate .
Wouldn &apos;t it be good for us to tell us , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Would I ever have an apple card or a spade ? &quot;
It would be better to know all of that before they &apos;re going to eat the mads .
And the way evolution has solved this problem was , it seems to be , in a field of work .
So we have this period of time in which we are fully protecting .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . It &apos;s just to learn .
And then , of adults , we can take that that we learned from babies and children and put it in the practice of the world .
One way of thinking about this is that babies and kids are small , and kids are like the Department of Investigation .
I &apos;m people &apos;s healthy people who look at it , and they only have some good ideas , and we are the production of the production and the Age .
We have to take all of these ideas that we learn from children and put them in practice .
Another way of it is , instead of thinking babies , we &apos;re thinking babies , and the kids like adults who are a different way , thinking about them as an event in a different age of the same species ; like the random ones and the tendons . But babies would be the random Islands in the same way of adults .
If babies are right , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows that it is , that kids are getting to learn , and that &apos;s the story of evolution in very powerful learning .
And in fact , the brain of a baby looks like the computer &apos;s computer learning more powerful learning .
What the real computers are to do .
There &apos;s been a revolution in our way to understand the machines of learning .
And all of the causes of the ideas of this man , the dare by Thomas Hood , a statistical statistical evidence of the 18th century .
Babically , Carl Sagan provided a mathematical device that was used to the probability of the probability to distract us and describe the way scientists discovered things in the world .
What scientists do it is to plant a hypothesis , something that we can begin .
And then they make that point out with evidence .
And the evidence is to change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that it &apos;s going to change the hypothesis .
You &apos;re going to see it , you &apos;re going to see it with new tests , and so you &apos;re going backwards .
What we called was a mathematical protocol that could do that .
And math math is the basis of the greatest cultural programs we have today .
Ten years ago , I suggested that babies were supposed to be doing the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s going on , this beautiful electromagnetic force , I think it &apos;s something very similar to me .
So at the end of the baseline , we found out on the face of the vastness of the Earth .
So , I think babies are doing very complicated calculation with probabilities and so that they look like this .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove .
If we ask an adult privacy about statistics , you can feel pretty stupid .
How are the kids doing statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine that we call the Inet SEet .
It &apos;s a box that comes out of it , and it sounds like when you get away from it .
By using this simple machine , in my lab , and also in the lab , if we &apos;ve done dozens of studies about the good that are the kids learning about the world .
So I &apos;ve shown you just one that we &apos;ve done with TM.ner , one of my students .
If you show you this detector probably you probably would start to think that the way that reactivate it is to put a wall that &apos;s about the way it is to put it .
But the case is that it works in a very strange way .
If I graduated from a wall that goes on the detector , something that we didn &apos;t think we would see in a beginning , the detached of two times .
We have that if we put the wall on top , what would it be , only in two times every six times .
So the chance it even has any more extra tests .
It turns out that strategy was going to turn out the object is more accurate than the other .
So we will explain this data to our children four years and we gave them to experiment .
And with security , the children four years old use the data , and they looked at it by the way at the time .
There are two key data in this fact .
The first one , the first one , who are young than four years old , and the first one , reminds me that it &apos;s five years old .
that are learning to count , who are learning to count , who are learning to count .
( Laughter ) But Minesweeper has been doing complex calculations that you &apos;re giving a measure of probabilities .
The second point is that they are using the evidence to get the evidence to get an idea , a hypothesis about the world , that seems kind of just a little bit .
So in studies that we do in the laboratory , another similar fact , we &apos;ve shown that our children four years are better understanding than adults , given the same task .
In these days , the kids are doing statistics to disconnect things around the world . But scientists tried it , after all , and we wanted to see if the children experience too .
It &apos;s what we usually call &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a lot of interesting studies , recently , showing that these games are showing that these games are kind of like a remarkable research program .
We &apos;ve shown this in the world &apos;s lab called &quot; &quot; Shaging are .
C<unk> ers have been used to have been found out of Bartet .
It showed up to the kids that the middle class would work and the red triangles , and there &apos;s nothing shown there .
What we &apos;re going to see now is this boy by starting five hypotheses .
Did you know ?
( Video ) Child : You know on the other side .
Audience : Well , the first hypothesis .
( Laughter ) Child : Nothing . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Man : This kettle , but this didn &apos;t .
Work : So he &apos;s a describe experience .
( Music : Why did this do that ?
( Laughter ) Yeah , I don &apos;t understand it .
Prime Minister : scientists are going to recognize that face desperate face .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
He said , &quot; A two .
Child : So he has to be .
Child : Oh ... can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) SS : Now it comes to the next idea .
I asked the researcher to try to get it on the other .
He worked hard .
( Video ) Man : Oh , it &apos;s because the light goes up there , not until there .
You can see this box there &apos;s electricity , but this doesn &apos;t .
Audience : Well , that would be the fourth chance .
Child : Now yeah .
If you make four papers .
If you make four leks in this , then you put it and two to two to you .
Audience : Well , that &apos;s the farm farm .
This child is — it &apos;s a very cute child , and it &apos;s a very typical child , but a very typical child .
If you look at how kids play the kids , if you ask the kids , what they do is we experiment .
Very typical 3 years .
Well , how do you feel that like this creature ?
What do you feel being used to be one of these boxes that can make five hypotheses in two minutes ?
If we put the theory of psychologists and philosophers , many of which babies and children are just conscious , or even not the absolute thing .
But I think it &apos;s the reverse .
I think babies and children are more conscious than adults .
This is what we know about how an adult works .
Consciousness and attention of an adult person is a focus .
What &apos;s happening in adults is that when we decide that something is important or relevant , we take attention .
Consciousness on it is what we &apos;re going to become , and the strong , as the ones that the rest of it is .
We also know how to do this in the brain .
When you pay attention to something , the front of the brain is , the front of the brain , is a sign that makes a little part of the brain if it gets rid of it , has a signal that makes a little part of the brain if it &apos;s going to become more peaceful , better to learn .
We have such a very drastic focus on purpose .
If we look at babies and children , we see something very different .
I think babies and children seem to have a clearer insight to a torch .
The babies and the whole world are very limit to attention one thing .
But give them a lot of data from a lot of sources of many sources .
And if you look at your brains , what we see is that it &apos;s been lied to a neurotransmitter that has induced into the learning and plasticity , and the self-discipline doesn &apos;t get the cable .
So when we say babies and children have problems to pay attention , what really means is that they &apos;re not paying attention .
I don &apos;t want to make fun of the interesting things that I might think something about just as important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness we have to expect of those Bowals that are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a way to feel that kind of child consciousness as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases where we are in a new situation where we are from a new situation we haven &apos;t been , and when we go to a city for the first time .
In those cases , it doesn &apos;t counter-damage , but it turns out that it seems that in three days in Paris , there &apos;s more awareness and experiences that every single month in Paris is going to work in the house .
So right now , that magnificent coffee , that magnificent coffee that we take down in reality is the effect of the gut , the effect of babies .
So how can it be a baby ?
It &apos;s like to be a boyfriend in Paris , for the first time , after taking three items .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling , but that &apos;s a wonderful feeling , but you don &apos;t expect to cry .
But it &apos;s okay .
I don &apos;t mean too much about the magnificent ones that are babies .
It &apos;s been an adult .
We can do things like rejection or crossing street .
And it has a sense that we &apos;ve been able to have a lot of effort to do that babies think that babies .
But if we do what we want to be like , these are going to be open , to be open , to be open to learning , and creativity , innovation , innovation , perhaps at least sometimes we must make adults a little bit like children .

( Laughter ) So these are simple objects : deafness , you have , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like , you , like ,
It &apos;s the things that victims of genocide in Bella are the things that victims of the genocide .
We are all made of these foreign objects and ordinary victims .
The fact that some victims used to take objects in the air , like the paste of his teeth is a signal that didn &apos;t have the idea of what it was .
They used to tell you that they were interchangeable .
These objects were recovered of my land in my field , and we wanted to talk about , the foreign hand bodies of the new livelihoods of the new GM estimates of war .
And it &apos;s maybe the big breakthroughs are the greatest amounts of fear .
Over the next four years of the conflict that was dishata or Bella at the principle of the 1990s , about 300,000 citizens , we &apos;ve changed most of the world , probably killed and some 1000,000 were killed during the operations .
The most was killed , well in the early days of war , or on the end of the conflict , they were in the end of the army .
The international court gave the international asylum in Africa , or death rates of humanity and genocide for crimes and genocide for crimes and refugees from death and genocide .
Land<unk> is the destructive destruction of an ethnic group , political , religious and race , religious and race .
So <unk> <unk> is so much that the metals are so hard to flourish in the world .
It &apos;s like the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement , and the third sign of its own existence , as the insurance causes of the destruction , as the destruction of the creation , and the assumption of its existence .
The genocide is not just the deficit of the identity of identity is the denial of identity .
There are always hints , there &apos;s no perfect crime , there &apos;s no perfect crime .
They &apos;re always going to get rid of the suffering that &apos;s more than their bodies &apos;s bodies , or that we are born memory .
( Laughter ) So these objects , they have widely understood a lot , and the objective of them are a unique process of objects that disappear in the first act of genocide in Europe from the Holocaust .
No parents should be born without trying to figure out how to read or not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -<unk> ing .
So once we recovered these objects that victims were used to its head by its head , we analyzed it , we analyzed it , and light hits if we looked at it .
You &apos;re going to get rid of plastic bags like you see at CS I have a lot of plastic bags like what you see in CSSme .
And it also seems to be if the tools are in the visual phenomena of victims of victims but also as much as individuals in the honor of war .
Sometimes it &apos;s called the verses to identify them , but the visual ousness is a difficult process , ineffective and painful process is a difficult process .
One time , doctors and lawyers knock them going to look like the narrative of the narrative of storytelling .
A lot of you can do it , even though it doesn &apos;t create a way , or just like this , if we don &apos;t have the capacity to figure out what &apos;s going on .
So a few years I decided to photograph up every single object to make a sense of visual file that we had to do to make a visual file that we had to do .
It seems like me to promote inousness .
And in this case , they can recognize the objects or at the same case , and in this case , they can recognize the objects or at least that the photos are still the way that the photos are still the way .
So a picture is empathy and some of these objects unattached objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a commitment , if you want , and the outcome is the way it &apos;s possible to make a document .
When you identify it at the very same time , they &apos;re going to get the bodies out there and these ordinary objects , and when you identify it as well as you identify it , it &apos;s going to get the bodies out there , and when you identify it as you identify it .
All of his simplicity makes these objects , they &apos;re operating for the identity of the victims of the first reminder that these people would have experienced the fact that those people would have experienced it .
Thank you very much .

A few years ago , so I decided to follow the footprints of the American philosopher , an artist named Slinen .
There are some things I learned about these challenges of 30 days .
I don &apos;t really know how much it was that the months before I didn &apos;t slow down , but the days was much more memorable .
This belongs to my challenge of taking a photo every day for a month .
It would never would have been so turer by Jesus because she would never have been so turer by neuroturer .
I also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood I &apos;ve also understood
So right , the secret is not to sleep deprivation .
But then you look at your novel .
It &apos;s terrible .
I don &apos;t have to say , I don &apos;t have to say , I don &apos;t have to say .
No . If I want to say , &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot;
And I learned that by making small change and cheaper , it &apos;s more likely to keep it all .
In fact , they &apos;re okay .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share my story .
This is picture ?
Because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t handle your cameras .
With all , my interested in the picture started when I had to make my first digital camera to 15 years .
And I thought it was a little bit different , because it was a little bit different , because it was a little bit different , because it was the process of design .
And when I was a picture of a picture with a camera , the process happens when he gave me a picture .
To me the picture I had to do with being in the secular place at the moment .
I mean anybody could do it .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process would begin to cover the velt .
( Laughter ) They all like this : a constructive one .
But it has an unexpected gyrus .
And yet , though , it keeps us a cooperative level .
Or photos like this — dark and colorful again , but it &apos;s not all about the common objective of it .
I mean , when I say , I &apos;m saying , Conalism .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually be really captured but I always want it to it , but I always want it to it .
( Laughter ) So what you need to think is a moment to discover the magic .
So this has more than seeing to capture an idea that with a truly moment .
But what is the trick that makes it real ?
Do you see the details or the colors ?
Do you see it with light ?
What creates the illusion ?
The times is the illusion .
But at the end , it &apos;s about our way to interpret the world , and how can it be repaired in a two-dimensional atmosphere .
It &apos;s not about it &apos;s not realistic , but we think it &apos;s realistic .
So I think the basics are very simple .
I was doing it as an architect in the fact that we take different pieces of reality and we went back to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you an example .
So here we have three physical objects perfectly imagined that we all can relate to a three-dimensional world .
But you can actually create something that &apos;s still three-dimensional ; as if you &apos;ve learned that there are .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t be there .
So we aim at our brain because the brain just didn &apos;t accept the fact that it actually has no meaning .
And I see the same process by combining the photos .
It &apos;s really interesting to combine together .
So the things that make a picture , it seems realistic , I think it &apos;s the ones that we don &apos;t even think we don &apos;t even think about ; the things you &apos;re missing in your life .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have this . Because it &apos;s not a rare thing .
So I would like to say that there are three simple ones that follow for realistic results .
As you can see , these pictures are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first one is that the first shot is that the photos are combined with the same angle .
According to , the photos , combined with the same kind of light .
And these two images were to cover these requirements ; it &apos;s been designed at the same time and the same kind of light .
The third point of it is to make all of you to tell where they start , and then they look so different pictures with a perfect chest .
It has to be allowed to say how to put the image in reality .
Making it out the color , the contrast and the shine , and shine in the branches that there &apos;s between the different images of the air , like the depth of the field , and , of course , we run the boundaries between the different images and we make it sound like this picture , despite the fact that an image that an sounds in reality may have hundreds of layers .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) I could think that this is the picture of a landscape and the lower part is what it was manipulated .
But this picture is completely generated by the photos of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier to think that it &apos;s easier to create a place that is , because it doesn &apos;t need to compromise the ideas that has in the head .
But this requires a lot of designers .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew I had a lot of months to design , to find the different places for designing the different places .
For example , the fish was captured in an exit .
The back are a different masterpieces .
The sutism was captured in a rock of stone .
And yeah , even I became red at home from the island of the island to make it better .
So to get a realistic outcome , I think it &apos;s necessary .
It &apos;s always a little bit about it , an idea .
So we have to combine the different pictures .
And here every piece is very good .
If a good thing makes a good job to take the photos , the outcome can be very beautiful and again .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that &apos;s true is our imagination .
Thank you .

So on this slide you have to look at its age in the horizontal axis .
After puberty , we come out of the map .
by a technique we &apos;re using around a technique that we &apos;re using around the world with a technique that we are using around the world around the world .
And the adoption of the German is completely different .
It changes our models of the critical time .
We had to establish a group of control in control of control .
But we asked them , &quot; &quot; But we are saying paper paper paper , &quot; &quot; but we are saying paper paper that paper shows that paper , and we said , &quot; &quot; But we are saying paper paper paper , &quot; &quot; but we are saying paper paper that paper shows that paper , and we wondered what paper paper was that paper was that paper , and we said , &quot; &quot; But we are saying paper paper paper , &quot; &quot; but we are saying paper paper that paper shows that paper , and
And another group that had only exhibit an audio and another group that had only been driven to a audio and another group that had only been to play the audio and the other group that had only been to play with the audio and the other group that had only been to play with the audio and the other group that had only been to play with the audio and the other group that had only been to play with the audio and the other group that had only been to play with the audio and the other
