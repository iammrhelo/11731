( Arabic ) ( Arabic ) It &apos;s called S@@ ag@@ ag@@ h@@ la@@ en Island , who &apos;s the name of Allah , who &apos;s the name of Allah , the god@@ name .
( Spanish ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on a media family .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but when I was born , he was a man of business .
If your children were children or girls , if their children were children or girls : they would go to school .
So I suppose I was fortunate .
My mother was getting at the age of 16 .
Of the 16 steps , we &apos;re living five .
You can imagine that I had to pass when I was a girl .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , she would see women being fed by the dog , or the children being brought to a chicken .
At that point , when I finished high school , I started wanting to be a doctor .
It was meant to help women and children .
So I remember my education , but he wanted to go to university .
To me , in my country , I didn &apos;t have to have women in the service of any of the people who had to judge in medical school , couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father sent me to America .
Look for America .
I expanded my studies .
As soon as I was finished my education , I passed through my country .
You know , when I was finished , I was going to end up my training , the stranger was happening to my family and my country .
They took months , and I didn &apos;t have bad news .
My family found out in a mine@@ field .
So , instead , I finished , I brought my family up to my family .
I want you to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I was talking about the bad news , when she was still in my country , I went to my heart .
I wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go there because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
It was just a university .
He was fine .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
They would look to them .
So it &apos;s not happy .
I wanted to go back to my house .
So I went back to the camp .
And when I came to the field of I@@ da Vinci , there was seven million and a half million dollars .
They were at the top of the 90 percent of women and kids . Most of men were in the war or they were in it , and they know that they were in the ballpark . And they know ?
And when I was told , when I was being told when I was told when I was told , when I was told the years I had to think about it .
He in a widow for five kids , and eight kids , sitting there , crying , without knowing it .
He in a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , without studies , or research , or a place where to live .
Look at kids who are losing their parents , their fore@@ fathers and 12 or 12 years old , they had to take their family head , to be the family head and try to protect their bad , their mom@@ ma .
The situation was absolutely dish@@ ear@@ tening .
My heart suffered from my people , I didn &apos;t know to do it .
At that point , there &apos;s a impulse .
So , I would feel like , &quot; I want to do this for these people ?
How can I help them ?
I &apos;m one person , who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education changed my life .
It turned out to me . O@@ den gave me a position .
It gave me to trust . It scares me a career .
I submit myself to my family my family , bringing my family to the other country , to make my family safe .
And at that point I knew what I was providing for my people was education and health and that was what I tried to do .
But think about it ?
Well , because of that , women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Furthermore , after the fMRI station in Afghanistan , people are not really trusted .
I was really hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; How many of you are ?
Somebody came from the United States .
Anybody who we raise in there .
They told me , of course , not .
So what I really needed was to gain to trust this community .
How am I going to do it ?
I &apos;ve been , I &apos;ve been exploring and watched .
I asked questions .
I found a man .
I was 80 .
It was just the end .
I went to his tent at me , and I told him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
And I looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; Look , how do I think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; Finally , he gave you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , he gave me a teacher . And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , he gave me a teacher .
It was a year ago , we had 25 schools , 15,000 kids running to school , and it was incredible .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
So of course , we were doing our work , forming teachers , ruling in the civil rights rights , human rights and laws . We &apos;re going to kick all sorts of things . And one day , we know that , we know that , we know , we &apos;re going to , we know that , we &apos;re going to , we know that , we &apos;re going to , we know that , we know that , we are doing all the types of things .
One day , one day , one day , I was in the office , and , one day , one day , I was in the office , and , one day , one day , I was in the office , and , one day , one day , I was in the office , and , one day , one day , I was in the office , and , one day , one day , I was in the office , and , one day , one day , I was in the office ,
So , suddenly I &apos;ll see that all my personal work running out of the door , and suddenly I saw that all my personal work running on the door , and suddenly I found myself , being the leader , who does it ?
You fear it . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is game .
But as a leader , you have to keep your posture .
You have to maintain your posture and show it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And those people put in mass to my office .
So I took my home .
They lived â€” nine , nine , nine .
These were the men the most awful men can see never .
( Laughter ) Small people with a little nasty , empty black clothes , and went into mass in my office .
And it sticks to sit and take one .
They didn &apos;t want to take it .
And of course , the voice of the voice that were employed very fear , and I was really affected .
But at the same time , they keep me safe .
And , of course , at that point , you see as seen as seen , covered by feet by a black man , a black Kenyan , a black Kenyan , a black Kenyan , a black Kenyan , a black Kenyan , a man by a black Kenyan , a black man , a black Kenyan , a man by a black man , a black Kenyan , a man by a black man , a black Kenyan , a man by a black man , a black Kenyan , a man by a black Kenyan ,
The only one that I saw was the eyes .
I asked me , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
Don &apos;t you know that the school is entitled to women ?
&quot; &quot; What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And she looked at me and he said , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And she looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the house of somebody .
See some students . We all learned the Koran , the holy book .
You know ? The Koran says that if you study the holy book of women can be good , and they can obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then he goes on one thing : it &apos;s like this person . ( Laughter ) At that moment , they &apos;re going to talk about it .
They talked about them , and they said , &quot; &quot; We are , let &apos;s face it , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re going to offer you it , and then it &apos;s going to offer you it , and it &apos;s got it .
So my personal staff gave up to my office .
They were killed of fear .
They didn &apos;t know why they were not killing me .
They didn &apos;t know why they had not taken me .
With all , we all were thrilled .
No , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) Of course , they claim to be alive .
But also , by calling them when during the fall of the Taliban , when the magnets had the power was another story .
We laughed at us , and we were taught to 80 girls , and we taught 80 girls , 3,000 students , 3,000 students , were announced to us without screens .
And the fall of the Taliban , we went through the country and open a school after another .
We open centers of education for women .
We open clinics without stop .
We worked with women and children .
We &apos;re focusing on productive health .
We &apos;re trying to refine some types of concepts can imagine .
I was so happy . I was really happy with my work .
And one day , when I was working with four educators , and a man , we drove over the north of the course of a moment , again , I had to go back on the road , did the 19 kids .
With chills , you block the road .
I told my driver who goes on and answer it , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; My name was and said , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell you . &quot; &quot; My wife came up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , I can answer you .
What we want ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and they love me .
At that point , the women would walk inside the car .
I &apos;m very affected , and I &apos;m like , &quot; This is the end . &quot;
We &apos;re going to kill us all .
He had no doubt .
But still , when the moment comes out , they make the forces of everything you think you are and what you do .
It &apos;s your heart .
Trust your weight , and you can follow that .
So I came up on one side of the car .
My leg went and walked away from the car .
Did I ask them , &quot; What can I help them ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; We know it &apos;s .
We know where it goes .
Come on every day of one place .
They called women , and they also gave them the chance to have a job .
( Laughter ) So let &apos;s face it . What about it ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; M@@ <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay .
What we know , the only one that we can do , for time , in which we played a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know anymore . And you know what it means .
Obviously it was a tramp@@ sman .
So then I went away and said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s face it . &quot; &quot; And I came up in the car , sat down , and I said to the driver â€” I sat down , and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , maybe we would help women .
We just had money to teach them to them , to let them go to school , and nothing more .
When I came to the office , obviously all the educators were running .
They ate their homes . Nobody was there .
My mother was the only one he was there , and I had no voice .
I was commissioned , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
Because we offer education in the north .
Women of women came out to teach us .
So I was there sitting there , and suddenly we &apos;re here talking about pulses , because at that point , one of my wonderful trips asked me to tell me , because at that point , one of my wonderful cousins were asked me to ask me .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , k@@ k@@ man . &quot; &quot; And I reply .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . I tried it .
It was equal to me , and he didn &apos;t really care about asking .
&quot; Okay , let me go . &quot;
I told the whole story .
Then he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next two , go and helps them .
He asked me . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I did the same way , they know that they were not there , they were just a little further away , and they were a little bit further away , the same boys in foot and point us to stop the car .
So I stopped the car .
I came up and said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; A condition . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; A condition . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; A condition . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , a condition . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , a condition . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; A condition . &quot; &quot; And I said
So I took the records to the mosque and to sum it , and I would like to do it .
Now , they are the best educators .
They learn English , they learn how to be , learning computer and sound .
All the areas we don &apos;t know , in the mountain of mountain , they come up with me . They go back and go .
And they protect us .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education changes to change .
When we educate people , they change and , in today , we need to work by equality .
You can &apos;t educate women and forget from men , because men are the people who make it more difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started to educate them , because they must be conscious of the potential of women , knowing how much of the potential of women , and those women can &apos;t get the same jobs that they have .
So we form men continuously , and I believe deeply deeply deeply and so that we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and I believe deeply deeply and so we form men and
I live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful , beautiful , peaceful country .
We take all the parts .
The women would receive education : lawyers , engineers â€” and we went home to another .
We don &apos;t prioritize the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out without security problems .
But we still want to Afghanistan .
And I want to tell you the other part .
Now the women in Afghanistan are very , very hard .
Guess they go . They have to be graded .
They studied to be doctrines , again .
They study to be the teachers and the business business .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share it with you by love , by compassion , by trust and prejudice .
If you have these things , we &apos;re successful .
We have a poet , Ma@@ ag@@ z@@ ar P@@ <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And he said that if you have compassion and if you have love , you can make the world .
And so on , we were able to .
And if we were able to Afghanistan , I &apos;m safe to 100 percent that anybody can get it around the world .
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So I was a doctor at UCLA University of California , L.A. University of heart disease .
So what I used was that when I was used to a psycho@@ analyst .
One old chimpanzees are sensitive to a facial diagnostics , and we care as a brain disorder .
I could ask me if I could go to the zoo to search for a possible cause .
We need to let the clear of the United States with the United States , and they &apos;re highly prone to catastrophic people who are very concerned about their patients .
But sometimes , let &apos;s face the medical community , especially for some longitudinal studies , especially for some longitudinal studies , especially for some longitudinal studies , especially for some intervention .
Putting 700 of the brain programs in the case of this chimpanzees , it &apos;s expanded to me , and I learned that the cha@@ sty of this day , I learned that the cha@@ cop@@ ing of this neighborhood was not slowing down . I &apos;m here on this picture , whether the heart of a piece of a day , and I learned that the cha@@ sty of this book was not fluorescent .
And this process , I &apos;ve been doing in a lot of human patients , was identical , with the exception of that , and that glue .
We struggle with symptoms struggle , struggle with symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my patients ; for their patients .
And when instead came out in the same days , I was going to attend to UCLA Medical Center on UCLA Medical School .
And I started to see a picture clearly : this one thing : &quot; &quot; I just started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started to see one thing : &quot; &quot; I started
And animals , if we &apos;re working on the same species and animals , basically , the doctors and <unk> ors were throwing the same diseases in the humans , and animals , of heart disease , or compulsive disorder , and the same diseases , like anxiety , citrus , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ness .
Well , I have to take a memoir .
I found that I studied deforestation and biology during university â€” even I &apos;ve done my favorite thesis on the morning of the morning â€” to learn more about the significant dangers of animals and human illness was a touch of attention to me .
And I started asking myself how to be , with all of these battles that we never asked , what would we have asked , what would we have to do and ask , to have another perspective on one of my patients ?
Have you ever been a fellow serving ?
Have you even more , why should it be ?
All doctors asked this some connections between animals and human beings .
All of the medicines we prescribe , we take that we &apos;re going to make our families tested before in a animal .
But there &apos;s a huge difference between an animal or a drug or a drug or a human disease , and that animal has evolved by himself as a heart disease or diabetes or PTSD .
Maybe maybe , part of the surprise that our world has changed between urban and not urban .
We hear about these children &apos;s children who think it &apos;s growing up in the trees or that plant gas .
Humans in this day are going to turn increasingly to turn more and more venture capitalists .
And this creates a psychological reactor among the human patients that are still treated and the animals that live in the ocean , and the animals that live in the oceans are in the highways .
But I think there &apos;s still a deeper point .
Now , the doctors and the scientists , the doctors and the scientists , the doctors and the scientists , the physicians , the doctors , is only one species , and the scientists , the scientists , the doctors , is only one species , and the scientists , the scientists , the doctors and the scientists , the doctors and the scientists , the doctors and the scientists , the doctors and the scientists , the doctors and the scientists who had our species , the Homo sapiens .
But in our underwear we don &apos;t just end up .
I &apos;m going to tell myself when I go back to Mozart or I &apos;ll see me on my Mac@@ Box the photos that he did Mar@@ ge to see .
I &apos;m suggesting that this is called the definition of the human selves , yet recognize the malarious way of biology as a one , to the part .
Well , it was , but this was a little girl .
Now , when I see a human patient , I always wondered : What do I know doctors of animals about this problem I don &apos;t know ?
What could I possibly do better to my human patient , and more : Could I take better to my human patient , and how could a human animal ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the way that we &apos;re trying to get the connections to me .
Gener@@ ally ill heart disease .
As a year , the ordinary peoples of humans had discovered , &quot; &quot; they had a &quot; &quot; per year .
It was to be described in a gentleman called the game that lost the savings of the entire life in a row of data , in a head left outside of the altar .
But it turns out that this new human diagnosis was not new and unique .
Kids were used to be used by when we tried to figure out whether or not they were operating in animals , from course , to the collections of a company , since the 1970s .
How many of the human lives could save if this knowledge would borrow from the medical doctors and the lawyers ?
It discouraged me .
Some human patients are getting themselves .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s no way to cut .
Some patients are also going to kill themselves .
There &apos;s been a lot of junk that you &apos;re saving , and again , even if you go down .
But prisons , they have very specific ways of treating themselves , and even prevent lobsters by the animals that behave like this .
Could I be able to be able to be asked by the <unk> ing of hacking , of parents and of patients who are going to suffer from them ?
De@@ pressure came up and psychosis , first .
Sometimes , at the time to give the light some of the women in depression , sometimes a severe depression , and even in states .
They can reject their own son , and they were supposed to arrive at the man@@ hole .
The <unk> ters of death are also the ones that know when instead of a water , a little bit after the birth , it can &apos;t stop its scarf , den@@ ying it , and some cases , to kill it .
But migrants have been involved a treatment to address this anonymous syndrome that means increase oxytocin .
Oxy@@ tocin is the hormone of the binding , and it makes it a bit more interested in its compli@@ cate@@ dness .
It shouldn &apos;t be this information at the disposal of smallpox , and we are makers of family doctors , from the family of family and the patients who are faced with a high school ?
Now , despite the promise that it &apos;s all about , the distance between our lives is being large .
To explain it , I &apos;m really afraid what I &apos;m going to have to do with some evidence .
Now , there are doctors who can be a self-@@ expert to the professional who are not supposed to end .
I mean , I think the Connecticut , we have chosen and psychologists , but especially in Austria .
Well , of course , most of the medical doctors had no idea that it &apos;s more difficult to get in today &apos;s days of life at a moment of life , and when we go to medicine , we learned everything that it &apos;s relevant to know about a species , the Homo sapiens , but when we go to medicine , we had to learn about the health and the Homo sapiens .
So I don &apos;t blame for mobilizing generations to sit with them and ignore them with my fellow inmates .
So here &apos;s a punchline of <unk> <unk> : How do you call a <unk> <unk> who can only handle a species ?
He expanded this gap in my passion , and I &apos;m doing through programs like Darwin called Darwin &apos;s , in the 20th century that we invited experts in , and biologists evolved to our medical doctors to help our own our nature and our residents .
And through Silicon Valley , we were asking ourselves , we invited ourselves from medicine and we &apos;re going to be able to take collaborative arguments on the disease , and the populations are broken by humans .
So at the conference , we learned how the treatment of a cancer diagnosis can help the treatment of a chest , and it can help us address the greatest treatment of a child mortality ; such as understanding the grace of a fetus of child education ; and how to understand better the treatment of the separation of slavery , and how to understand the treatment of the separation of the separation of the foreign land , and how to understand the treatment of aid .
At the conference , first in the U.S.
For the end , humans are also animals , and it &apos;s time for us , doctors , and we hooked up in a response to the health that runs every single species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and the most appropriate rulers are being records by doctors that are not human .
And one of the best ways of treating human patient is nurturing a lot of attention of attention how all the other patients of the planet live , grow , doctors and dogs .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; was . &quot; &quot; U@@ p@@ <unk> !
( Applause ) Having prostate cancer was , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine , as you can imagine .
I didn &apos;t know anything about Hurricane 9 .
So in cultures around the world , when you have genomes , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you have bosses , when you
Life : life , in a complex , is replaced by medical data : your credit card , medical testing , the results of the lab .
Suddenly on a diagnosis in a disorder with legs .
The doctors start talking to talk about a language that you don &apos;t understand .
Take the sign with your body and your muscles .
People are starting to change too much because they start treating a disease rather than the person .
They ask me , &quot; &quot; What would you say the doctor ? &quot; &quot; even before they say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; Whereas so much of it , I think , &quot; &quot; Hello , what &apos;s the doctor ? &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; Hello , what &apos;s the doctor ?
Do you ask the guy who â€” you know ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to work with Palin .
Are you who studying ? Are we doing love ?
Have you ever done it , &quot; &quot; What did I do to do this ? &quot; &quot; P@@ judge : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to change something in my life every time ? &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s something that can do it ?
Is there any other option ? &quot; &quot; And , of course , doctors are the ones in all of these cases , because they &apos;re very professional and committed to design .
But they also are really used to treat patients , so I would say that sometimes you &apos;re looking at it , and you &apos;re going to make it , literally , a patient .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is that you avoid any way in knowing your family , and your friends are going to teach you some way to modify your life and friends or teach you some way to modify your risk .
But with all of you , I &apos;m going to thank you to the waiting of a very professional idea .
As I was in the hospital , I asked me that print me in the hospital , I asked me , print me out to me .
It was really hard to get that , because it &apos;s not very uncommon to ask your own .
I &apos;ve talked to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; Very good , Canadians don &apos;t represent me .
I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , the cure , is , will have to face the whole of my being . &quot; &quot; So the next day , I went to the next day .
I was going to change my relationship to the hyena , and I was decided to learn more about it before doing something as dramatic as an operation .
I &apos;m an artist , I use a lot of an open process of open , open information into my work .
So my big bet was actually spreading everything , and it &apos;s so easy , and it &apos;s so easy that anything else could do it .
So I created a website called &quot; &quot; La C@@ <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; which I &apos;ve created a web , called &quot; &quot; La C@@ <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and , I created a website called &quot; &quot; La C@@ <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and then I created a website called &quot; &quot; La C@@ <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and then I created a website called &quot; &quot; La C@@ <unk> , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and then I created a website called &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve had to have that sort of rubble , but that &apos;s why we can talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) And I think this word , &quot; &quot; La C@@ <unk> a , &quot; &quot; because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; can have a lot of meanings .
Now , in our Western culture means to eradicate or to make a disease , but in other cultures like South Asia , of the Latino world , of the Latino countries of Africa , can represent many other things .
I mean , of course , I was interested in doctors and the rest of the health professionals , but they also had me to cure the proposal for the artist , by the poet , for software , or so not by all of the musicians .
I was interested in social cohesion , and I was interested in training a psychological revolution , and I was interested to drive the courage , to be interested in designing for a whole new way .
And it worked .
The fourth &quot; &quot; La &quot; &quot; has been around the world .
I took a lot of attention about I@@ ke@@ a and the most enlar@@ ous people in the world , and most of 3,000 people get caught me in a very little bit of time through emails , social media â€” Most of them were celebrated for me as a person .
For example , we created thousands of videos , images , photos , and artistic prosthetic sockets .
We &apos;ve got the example of Francis Mos@@ i and his act .
Or what he did is he did the artist , L@@ ank@@ sy , called a 3D sculpture of my tumor , and I put it on the bottom of it .
Now you can also have my genomes !
( Laughter ) If you think you think it &apos;s cool , we can share the same pattern .
And this was what was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , diverse researchers , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , physicians , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , physicians , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , physicians , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors , physicians , doctors , doctors , doctors , doctors ,
Having all this information and support , I &apos;ve been able to take a team of clinical trials , traditional physicians and a few hundreds of volunteers that I could talk about , which is very important .
We were able to formulate a strategy from my own cure by different languages and as different cultures .
So the current strategy slowing down the whole world and thousands of years of human history , that we found quite stunning .
( Video ) Computer : Be an example .
So I could take my time to you .
I took the doctor I wanted to work with , I picked up the hospital in what I wanted to be , and how many of thousands of people who were supporting me , and how many of these people were supporting me .
All the world would feel that it could be useful to help me , and this was the most important part of La C@@ lin@@ a .
Did you have the results ?
I mean , as you can see , very well .
( Applause )
My life changed my life and my lifestyle .
So it was very intense , and it was very intense , it had a network of electrodes tied to my brain on this side , so it was very intense , it had a functional network of electrodes tied to my brain .
And just before the operation , we were able to analyze this map with the doctor to understand the risks that was going to run and had some of my wish to help .
Obviously , no .
This is the real key of La C@@ lin@@ a .
Millions of people share their stories , their experiences .
The doctors arrived talking to talk about people who typically don &apos;t have to follow when it &apos;s about the demand .
I &apos;ve created myself , I &apos;m in a continuous state of translation among many different languages , where science has found in emotion and the conventional research with traditional research .
&#91; SODIS &#93; : So the key point of La C@@ lin@@ a was felt a part of a truly committed society and connected to global well-being of each one of their subjects .
This world world is mine , for instance .

I don &apos;t have the idea of what we &apos;re going to play .
I don &apos;t mean what &apos;s happening to me .
I didn &apos;t realize that there was something of music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start what I &apos;m going to start with .

So <unk> <unk> , as we call it , is an incredible space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that &apos;s working holy is that we don &apos;t want to think about the future of thinking about the future , or in the past .
You &apos;re still alive right now .
We have to take a lot of decisions when one goes to the <unk> .
We had no idea what we were going to play .
So we had a gift of a song called &quot; &quot; E@@ j@@ el . &quot; &quot; But that could actually happen or not .
We all listen . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician from a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about somebody else &apos;s error .
The way I &apos;m perceiving as a mistake is when I &apos;m in the middle of nowhere , you don &apos;t see a mistake .
The single mistake I don &apos;t want to think of perceiving it is what another did .
Every mistake is an opportunity .
It &apos;s even hard to describe what it would be like .
For example , if I &apos;m painting a color , as if you &apos;re playing around the entire life , you would look like this ...
( Music ) If Christian Christian , if Christian . ( Music )
You see , all fits in the entire life of colors .
If it comes to M@@ i .
You see , all of course in the inside of this emotional ideas that we &apos;re painting .
However , if we touch the # # Gu@@ .@@ A majority error .
You see , we &apos;re going to play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this stuff .
At some point , I was supposed to add this bill .
And we &apos;re not going to re@@ wire it .
He &apos;s going to play for a second , and then I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;ll talk a moment .
We &apos;re going to see it &apos;s what happens when we touch it with this stuff .
( Music ) ( Music ) Trust it , somebody might think of him as a mistake .
I would just say , if it &apos;s about a mistake if we don &apos;t respond to it .
A lost chance .
So it &apos;s im@@ minent . We &apos;re going to paint it again .
He will play it . I don &apos;t know how to limit it , but it &apos;s a way to change .
We &apos;re going to embrace their ideas , or not .
( Music ) Did you see his grade .
And I created a melody .
This time it changed the texture of it .
It was a little more rhythmic , a little bit more intense , a little bit more intense .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The single mistake is , if you &apos;re not conscious , if every catch is conscious and don &apos;t recognize its fellows to rethink the idea and we &apos;re not going to allow creativity .
This is really incredible .
It &apos;s a storyteller .
And I know why I talk to everyone when I say we don &apos;t make sure .
We know it &apos;s going to be able to climb by the <unk> ness and make music as a matter .
And what do you think about this is ?
We are all musicians of jazz , our BS is not the most right for the expansion .
( Laughter ) I just wanted to show you how we &apos;re facing .
And the other translation is we don &apos;t make micro@@ referrals .
There are people who do it .
But that &apos;s true , that limit the artistic wisdom .
If you tell the band that we put it together and I want you to go back and say , you know , I &apos;m going to ...
Come on , let me do something .
One , two , two , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit out because there &apos;s a little bit out of the ideas .
I mean , &quot; &quot; I hope &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy by this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music , the best thing I can do is to listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more than to see what I can do .
If I want to talk to the music , the first step for me is to be patient , the first step to me is to be patient , listening to what happens to me around me .
When you do it , motivating and inspired the other musicians and they damage it , it &apos;s going to do it .
See , two , two , two , two , three .
( Music ) It &apos;s something completely different when I shot my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more berries .
It &apos;s not about spreading home to my vision .
It &apos;s going to be at the moment , so we accepted each other , and let &apos;s make it full .
Thank you .

He wrote this to his love .
I &apos;m going to be sincere , and I &apos;m just these amazing talks and ideas that are being exposed to , and I think they &apos;re being exposed to you in the position of stepping up here to talk to talk about it .
All the world sees television .
He helps us . He lets us feel a few things .
Here in America .
The average person on television is about five hours a day .
Right ?
A year I live on the television , so that for me , it &apos;s something special .
But a lot of people don &apos;t like .
They , in fact , burned .
It &apos;s useless , and things worse , believe me .
My mother , when I was a girl , said , &quot; &quot; The box . &quot; &quot; My intention today is not supposed to be if there &apos;s the old television or the Spanish television â€” my idea today is to tell you that the television has consciousness .
If I think television has been consciousness is because I think television shows directly the moral needs , social policy and emotional emotional needs of our own â€” television is how we actually have our values of values .
All of that is intrinsic to humans , and it gave us our sense of consciousness .
We don &apos;t talk about a good television or bad television .
We talk about black television .
We talk about the 10 programs in the audience over 50 years .
As that rate grows not just what you hear , you know , it &apos;s the idea of our social scars and collective laughter , if you don &apos;t also , like those 10 programs for years reflecting the idea of our social consciousness ?
So how does it make television over time , and that &apos;s analogous to our society ?
And by analyzing the theme of evolution , from a basic biology , if a basic level , if you know that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four basic basic mathematical mechanisms .
They adapt , relationships , power , and the wish of being .
As human beings , what we have to remember is we developed the time we developed it , we evolved in time , we evolved with the basic animal instincts .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel fear , compassion .
This isn &apos;t that in the animal kingdom .
The other thing you see is the entertainment .
I think about television .
This is something that emerges from the animal world clearly .
When animals can play it , but they don &apos;t have to catch up .
So let me try to figure out what &apos;s going on from this unique relationship of humans between the television programs between television and human consciousness .
Why does it evolve ?
The kid imagery was the sketches of the demo , and we &apos;re sitting in our shoulder .
The television works like our consciousness , try and respect us at the same time ?
To begin to challenge these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
We filmed 50 years ago , and we found that as we came back 50 / 60 .
We came up in the top of the audience that spent 50 years â€” thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people almost 3@@ -@@ 3@@ 600 - - - and 1970s , and we poll as if they were emotionally emotionally .
How would you sit here at all of these programs ?
Did you sit there a ritual ?
Do you sit down to the collar ?
What &apos;s meant to you ?
So our TED audience , I mean that it took the time in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotional needs are universal universal .
And second , a 80 percent of the most popular the most popular programs of the U.S.
I want you to tell you that our audiences will be identified .
I want you to thank the two people before I &apos;ve been going to the first slide : Why did it really inspired me to think about the idea of consciousness and the tramp@@ ps that consciousness can hit us on the day the day , by the way , through the <unk> -@@ C@@ arian G@@ ay .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to make the data , I want to get out of the very known TED Talk to TED speakers to Hans Rosling .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
So here you see , since 1960 , the 1950s .
So there are two things we &apos;re going to start the state of storytelling , and the state of imagination , that for this study , we define the exhibit as the television programs that are going to make me feel better about the world .
E@@ <unk> - performing arts are the programs that don &apos;t buy the difference between good and harm .
At first , you see that in 1960 what &apos;s happening now .
So we see television .
In@@ fra@@ er starts to moral age .
I end up at the end of 60 , dealing with old moral age increases , and literacy low .
Why ?
The crisis of the brand in Cuba , the murderer and J@@ F@@ K , the movement for racial leaders , the Vietnam War , the Mississippi of Martha , the Mississippi of Martha , the Mississippi of Martha , the Intergovernmental Panel on Kennedy .
Look what happens .
1970 , the posters don &apos;t get it .
E@@ k@@ ra old moral age .
Hold on , more Ronald Reagan , a television coverage , is the control .
It &apos;s clear to me .
But look , you can &apos;t , it can &apos;t , the I@@ agreement , the <unk> <unk> of Ch@@ ats , Chernobyl .
E@@ an@@ ra k@@ ra becomes the dominant tendency of 1990 to the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This graph shows a similar trend .
But in this case , we have the happiness of the red bubbles â€” the social and the reverse , in blue and green .
So at that time , we have &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and national programs that reflects happiness .
It will increase increase . The happiness opens up all .
Same requirements starts to rise .
Shake the social comment increases .
We get to 1969 and look at what happens .
The happiness , the amplification and the social philosopher , not only in our society , but there are two programs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
What was the number one ?
The number of <unk> <unk> and socially privileged are name , &quot; &quot; Ro@@ <unk> and Martin &apos; &quot; &quot; My name and Martin &apos; &quot; &quot; My name and Martin &apos; is &quot; &quot; The Patriot Game , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; My name and Martin &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; The Patriot Game , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; My name and Martin &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; The Patriot Game , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; My name and Martin &quot; &quot; is the name and
They all live together .
The viewers responded in a spectacular way .
Let &apos;s see this green peak in 196@@ 6 .
When you hear the term , success without precedent , who mean ?
I mean , in the early days , I don &apos;t mean that in 1963 , &quot; &quot; S@@ m C@@ est@@ on Fe@@ ed S@@ <unk> .
This was the first program that allows the viewers to say , &quot; Oh , my God , I can comment on what I think of the Vietnam War , on the president , through television , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I mean .
Well , in the same way , look at what happens .
1970 , the bubbles , the bubbles came out .
We don &apos;t see television by entertainment .
And the social and the same rate , and the same rate of themselves .
Now this .
How did I get the 70 ? Norman Lear .
We have all in the family , &quot; San@@ ford and communications , &quot; and the main program on the world 10 to the &apos; 70s by the &apos; 70s , &quot; &quot; M@@ ick@@ ford .
In the 50 years that we study , seven of the 10 episodes of the most revered programs came out during the Civil Rights Movement , five of 10 to 10 times during the year .
There &apos;s just one generation in 20 years , and we &apos;ve learned , &quot; &quot; Oh , hey ! The television can do that ?
Can you make me feel that ?
Can we change it ?
So this audience , I want to tell you that the new audience has not invented the problems .
Archie Bun@@ ker was pushed out from his pajamas from his trunk from the rest of us .
This is another graph . With other variation : knowing it and imagination , who are programs put it like , &quot; &quot; Having a sense of reality , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; So they do it in front of the red dot , pause , which is a statistic of mine .
You &apos;ll see that every time your fantasy and imagination is , you know , it &apos;s going to fall out of it .
We want to see programs about people saving money and continuing ?
No . ( Laughter ) So we found the beginning of &quot; &quot; The Patriot &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; The Patriot Game , &quot; &quot; which was translated out of death in 1973 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million dollars . &quot; &quot; One peak in the 1980s â€” another peak of programs of control and power .
What if there were in those programs ?
Gloria and rich .
&quot; &quot; Anat@@ omy &quot; &quot; <unk> .
It &apos;s just a thick piece of our national psyche , so hard to fix it .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
You &apos;re either in my head , I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard or read about the fall of the bottle , and the march of understanding .
As we say about it , the X is the place .
Up to the 1990s , the years of humor , you &apos;re like &quot; &quot; Fri@@ end@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But look , the X is the place .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , humor succumbs .
Why don &apos;t it ?
We had the presidential 2000 text by the Su@@ ab@@ ma .
The popcorn of the most technological bubbles .
It &apos;s September .
This is a part of a social lexicon .
It turns out what happens in time .
So in the course of the century , the Internet would go out to the question .
What do the people want to do ?
I would think it &apos;s going to starve or broken .
It gives me happiness , my world go down .
Don &apos;t , you want to judge .
I can get it outside of the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin &apos;s dance .
I can choose the new triumph . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired . You &apos;re tired .
Great , right ?
So the radically different thing that are these programs , of pure entertainment , were there for 50 years â€” that was what I said at the beginning of the beginning ?
We are animals , we need our mom@@ selves .
There was not a couple of television who had no television and dominant mother .
In the 1700s , June P@@ le@@ <unk> in the summer of a program , &quot; &quot; Leo it . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a great . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
To give you a book , the archetype of the Hon@@ ist , who talked about abortion , celebrated , even though , even after abortion .
In the 1980s , it came to the first &quot; &quot; dy@@ er . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) In the 1980s , he came up the way the way of Beethoven &apos;s T@@ Q .
( Video ) Man Brown Brown is a Jewish judge who had the idea of being a single mother .
The mother of this was the mother and Van Meegeren .
So I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s about a demo or a sitting in our consciousness , sitting in our prism , what I know is that the picture .
So all of you , women and men from TED@@ Women , the audience of TED@@ Women &apos;s viewers , the audience of TED@@ Women &apos;s speaking of the television .
But it &apos;s also going to give away because of the Koran that goes up in the morning to be able to reduce their ideas in our own screens for these years .
Dan &apos;s life on the television , safe , but you like to follow it through the consciousness of collective social media , gives life , longevity , power or not .
So thank you so much .

As I went into a prison prison in Cambodia , I found myself a 13-year-old boy who was tortured and said , &quot; &quot; I used to make a lawyer .
And as I looked at the eyes of my eyes , I realized that hundreds of letters that had written in the political , never letter was written for him , because it wasn &apos;t an 18-year-old boy who did something important for somebody else .
It wasn &apos;t a politician ticket .
It was a 10-year-old boy who had a bicycle .
And what I found myself was that not only was in Cambodia , but from 110 countries in the developing world that they were interviewing , 93 of these Muslim countries on the development of the laws that are poor to a lawyer and the right to not be tortured .
And I realized that there was an amazing thing of opportunity for all of us as an amazing community of opportunity to all of us as we have our world community level .
We often think of torture as a form of torture of politics , or that &apos;s exclusive only for the worst , but in fact , 95 percent of the parts today are not to trapped in political .
I &apos;m for people who are in the aftermath of the court system , and unfortunately , they concluded that torture is the cheaper way of research that &apos;s cheaper , cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper than having a lawyer or access to the situation .
The day today we &apos;re managing it is possible for us as global community community , if we take that decision , put that decision , put that decision , put that decision method of research during our lives , but this re@@ burst of three things .
First of it comes out , providing power and connection to the world scale .
The second is to ensure that there is a temperament and systematic access to the situation .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started asking myself , and if we go back ?
Could we do something about those 93 countries ?
And I founded the International Space Station , which has been a particular quest to end with the fin@@ alizing of the research method , and put it in the face of these 93 countries , including the research method of research and calling in a court .
However , my early childhood experiences came out of Cambodia , and remember my first trip to Cambodia , when I was , in 1994 , even fewer than 10 a.m.
And even 20 years later , so there was only 10 a.m.
And the first group of community advocates and I still remember , as a man , who said , &quot; Well , what do you do about investigating ? &quot;
And the room was still in silence , and finally , a woman stood up , and he finally said , &quot; &quot; K@@ <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to get more than one percent of people and I &apos;m talking about it . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to get more than one percent of people and I &apos;m talking about it . &quot; &quot; And we talk about it , and we talk
And these astronomers had to be able to decide to decide that they would start to defend themselves and supporting them to be able to deal with these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came out , on the top quartile , and the rest of them , and they support him , while the hell did the judge , while the hell did the judge , then they were saying , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not , we &apos;re not ,
She said that in reality , she watched the person out of the person who were going to run out and thought , but the police came out , and then she didn &apos;t have anything on it .
So then she was out there . He had it . He had an abortion .
And when it took his case to a judge , for the first time this came out and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except except by helpless , and by the way , it &apos;s going to be a lot of evidence . &quot; &quot; And the advocates who started to take action one , and the advocates who were going to take cases of the story of Cambodia .
But it &apos;s not either .
I used to think , well , it &apos;s just unlikely .
Or also does other countries ?
But it &apos;s going to be so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it &apos;s happening in so many countries â€” it
I went into a prison , and not there was a 13-year-old boy , but there was a 13-year-old boy who had a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I pasted myself in arms to his baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But he wasn &apos;t a baby , the girl had three years .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here , but I &apos;m here because she was accused of stealing two liters and an apartment to his baby , and he still was in prison .
And when I went back to the principal of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You must let it in freedom .
A man would take it off . &quot; &quot; And he responded , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can &apos;t talk to you , but look at my prison , the 80 % of the two million people here are without lawyers , what can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers started to organize a system where they could take the cases .
And we realized it wasn &apos;t just about the Catholic Church , but the connection of pottery that made the difference .
For example , in Cambodia , what happened was that they were not entirely it , but he didn &apos;t have it , but he had the same way in China , and the same way in China , always told me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the desert when we can &apos;t remember &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; And the same way in China has always been saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the desert when we can &apos;t remember it . &quot; &quot; I said ,
I mean , we can &apos;t help create the fairness as we don &apos;t have to help create the resources , and then they adapt , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know what the lack of resources never been to the media . &quot; &quot; And so we tested it with success to 68 years .
So it &apos;s all the solution that we &apos;ve found was , and then , the solution is , and then , the solution .
I &apos;m recently in Los Angeles and I decided to meet myself with another group of mine . What did they tell me that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , now we don &apos;t have the police in the streets . The police is one of the main reason we had the revolution . &quot; &quot; And the police is one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were both of the main reason we had the revolution .
What is happening then ? I picked up with one of the different development of development and they were in the state of the development , which turns out to be the normal tendency , instead of thinking .
We show up to a manual that was actually great .
And he asked me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll copy it . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s all about him . Cat@@ gs can come back to the police station .
They were perfectly formed .
But he said , &quot; &quot; I just have a question . Before everybody came up to the house of the fiscal , who would happen to them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , you say , &quot; &quot; Tor@@ mi@@ ds . &quot; &quot; And after a pause , he said , &quot; &quot; I wonder .
And so the key things are not just about the toughest , but I &apos;m finding a way to try to get a way to try to make a sense of the judgment , because they are running in the system for people who are being tortured .
And as I tell you this , they are also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , &quot; &quot; it seems like if I could do it , but can we do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it looks very beautifully .
And it &apos;s a lot of why I think it &apos;s possible .
The first one is , the first one is that the people on the ground are able to create miracles through their commitment .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> tic , but it &apos;s also meant to tell you about the world that they are looking at these key bits .
We have a program called A@@ <unk> A@@ an , and we realized that there were people drowning and who wanted to help , but how could we support them ?
So it &apos;s just a competition in line where you can gain five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to have some innovative idea of dealing with the fairness .
And there are 30 <unk> ers across the world , from the Sri L@@ ank@@ by Y@@ ata , or the Democratic Republic of Congo , which with five billion dollars , which with five billion dollars , programs spread out and all the way that it is .
And there &apos;s not just these Neanderthals , but there are also many people who understood what they understood what their contacts are , and how they can take them to them .
For example , in China announcing the laws that the cops could breathe to people as a candle .
And while I was sitting together with one of our creators , I said , &quot; &quot; And how could we spread it ? How can we make it happen ? How can we make it happen ? How can we make that happen ? How can we make it happen ? How can we make it happen ? How can we make it happen ? How can we make it happen ? How can we make it out ? How can we make it out ? How can we make it out ? How can we make it
This is fantastic . And he challenge me , &quot; &quot; You have money ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve talked about the fact that we need to form and support advocates .
We need to try to breathe in selection in selection .
But the third and last point , the most important , is that we adapt to this .
And usually people say , &quot; &quot; Well this is really good , but it &apos;s too strong .
It would happen to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason I see here is that this point of view is because that &apos;s exactly the same view that we &apos;ve been able to end with slavery or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who were working .
One of our favorite poems of the possibility , which they share each other , is , it has value , friends , the way it &apos;s not clear , and there &apos;s a lot of game , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not really clear , and there &apos;s a lot of game , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not just the way , but in the bottom , you can &apos;t end up as a global community community , but in the bottom , you are not just a lot of it ,
And I always end up , because I know that the question is going to be , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure to talk to you , and why can I do it really ? &quot; &quot; Well , the first one tells you that what can you do . &quot; &quot; Well , second place you &apos;ll be like to say what you can do . And secondly , let &apos;s take a look at the International Space Station .
So this was a friend of four years when I met him . He was in a Cambodian prison in the crash , but as I was born in prison , we all had a lot of gratitude , and he had a lot of gratitude , and she had a lot of gratitude , and she had the only one that he could get and got out of between .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s going to be , and when you go back in the started growing up , which is what also grows ? The head .
What I was going to was going to happen by the first few minutes later , and then finally , very soon , was the head of power , and then then finally , very fast , moving the head of the first place , and then he grabs me , because what he wanted to do was to go back to the first one .
And of course , he never had to go to the whole world every day , but he wanted to go back to all the 15@@ 6 feet , and then we took it back to his fingertips .
Or if they were dark , it was like arms and it went on their fingertips .
And most of the inmates said that it was their largest le@@ m@@ es@@ on and his sun and the sun , and I thought , and I thought , and I thought , here &apos;s going on .
Put me in a prison without almost anything , without a sense of materials , but a sense of its own journey , which in my view we &apos;re all going to be in one . And I said , &quot; &quot; No , I can &apos;t do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;ll make the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I thank you because I thank you because I thank you because I thank you to have the ability to imagine a new world with all of us together and try to make this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
A couple of people think there &apos;s a formula for TED : &quot; &quot; Making a talk to TED &quot; to TED . &quot;
&quot; Tell a story of childhood . &quot;
Use a secret .
You adapt to an inspiring act called action .
No .
It &apos;s not like there &apos;s a TED speaker .
In fact , if we &apos;ve been used too much of these mechanisms , you &apos;ll look a clip or manipulate it .
But there &apos;s one thing that all the great TEDx Talks have in common , and I &apos;d like to share it with you , because listening to you several hundreds of wonderful actors , like these .
It gave us their audiences of the audience of the audience , and learned directly from them all the secrets of a great talk .
And even if these shots and their subjects seem completely different , they all have an active ingredient .
And it &apos;s this : The main task as the speaker is transfer is transfer by the head of the speaker , a stranger , and beautiful object that we call it .
Let me explain to you .
This is Hyderabad .
It &apos;s just to give a TED Talk , and frankly , it &apos;s pretty unlikely .
( Video ) ( Video ) Il@@ da : Holy kar@@ y dog !
( Applause ) One 200 people , a lot of what would you have never seen before you feel that your brains are synced by H@@ ids and each other .
They &apos;re literally beginning to take the same pattern patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to take a look at the brain &apos;s brain .
There are millions of neurons in an audience .
But look here , right here , there &apos;s a couple of millions of people in a way that represents a single idea .
In the mind of all the audience .
It &apos;s like there &apos;s a pair of minutes , a pattern that involves using millions of command neurons , only people listening to a voice and look at a face .
But then , what is an idea ?
Well , you can imagine it as a pattern pattern that helps us understand and navigate the world .
So ideas come from a lot of ways and <unk> ers , from the complex and analog architecture of the simple and ethical .
So here &apos;s a pair of broken examples from the TED stage .
Sir Ken Robinson , creativity is the key of the future of our children .
( Video ) Steve : What I hope is that creativity now , and we have to engage with the same status quo .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So E@@ ie &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is beautiful .
( Video ) Esther Har@@ dy : It &apos;s strong , it &apos;s physical , it &apos;s elegant , resists <unk> .
CA : Chad &apos;s &quot; &quot; A@@ di@@ sts &quot; &quot; is more than a single identity .
Video : The simple story is A@@ di@@ e : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that full .
CA : Well , your mind opens up ideas , and it doesn &apos;t get random .
They are ed@@ ingly connected .
Indeed , it makes an unbelievable framework that &apos;s your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like sailing in the world .
And you take millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a little component of the world is the idea that the gates are loved ones , then in the green of this , they respond to this .
But if another component of your view of the world is the idea that the leop@@ ards are dangerous , then in the green of this , they respond very much differently .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your view of the world are crucial .
You need to be the most troubling that it &apos;s possible to be possible , a candy for the sake of it .
Now , different visions of the world &apos;s world can be very different .
For example , how is it to your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) D@@ alia Moga@@ hed : What do you think about you ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of a woman , &quot; &quot; an affair , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization , &quot; &quot; an organization ,
Or , like , &quot; &quot; neonatal &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; a terrorist , &quot; &quot; by &quot;
CA : You fear it &apos;s the answer , there &apos;s millions of people out there who respond very different .
If you communicate in the right way , they are able to change the way , always the way that somebody sees the world and turn its actions so much as much as in the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that makes human culture .
So if you accept that your main task as a master task is to build an idea in your mind of your audience , here &apos;s four instruction instruction to address that task : First , just just like your talk to a single idea .
The ideas are complex things ; you need to reduce the content to be able to focus on the simple idea that I love you , and have the opportunity to explain it .
You give you a context , I share examples , that .
So I put an idea of an idea , and what &apos;s a thread that has a whole set of whole talk about it , so it turns out that it &apos;s going to make a sense .
Second , let your tell you a reason to tell you a reason .
Before I start to build things in the minds of the audience in the audience , you have to have your chance to get it .
And what is the tool to make it ?
Curiosity .
Rem@@ ote of curiosity curiosity .
You know , you know , you know , it &apos;s made out to identify why something doesn &apos;t have any meaning and accurate .
If you can reveal a disconnect connection in the world of somebody , you &apos;ll feel the need to cover that gap .
And when I was that wish is much easier to build the idea .
Third , it turns out , and your thought , it &apos;s a piece of physics that your audience knows .
You use the power of language to weave online together , you know that there &apos;s no language in your mind , your language .
See where they are .
Kids are often forget that many terms of a lot of terms and concepts that they see are completely crazy for their audiences .
Well , they &apos;re playing a crucial role to show how they fit the pieces , because they reveal the shape of the pattern , it &apos;s based on a thought that she understands it .
For example , when Jennifer insisted he had to explain incredible novel called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like if , for the first time , you had a text message to edit DNA .
It lets you cut down and take a lot of genetic information . &quot; &quot; Well , an explanation is like this offer a great moment of interpretation of a while in our mind .
It &apos;s important , so that &apos;s important , so testing the talk with friends of trust , and to see that parts are more satisfying .
Give it . Here &apos;s the thing the end : it makes your ideas .
So I mean , I mean , that &apos;s a question : &quot; What does this work ? &quot;
And I need you to talk to the answer .
If the idea only benefits to you and your organization , then I &apos;m going to feel say , you probably don &apos;t have the existence .
The audiences will see through you .
But if you make the idea that the idea has the potential to shape the day or change the perspective of somebody else &apos;s perspective or to inspire somebody else else else , then then you have the essential ingredient for a good talk , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
We only have a 25 percent of what we &apos;re listening .
( Laughter ) So I promise you that I would promise you every day I would promise you every day I would promise you every day I &apos;ll promise you every day .
( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling ) ( R@@ umbling
And the art of the conversation and the conversation about the conversation and the conversation is the art of the conversation .
A world where we don &apos;t listen to each other &apos;s one another .
To re-@@ recreate the ear , to re@@ mixing and submit , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , and the ear , the ear , the ear , the
It &apos;s a lot of the ordinary sounds .
So for example , this is my pen .
We see that ordinary sounds can be very interesting if we get attention .
My passion is my passion .
Imagine you &apos;re on a street of any place from any place of America , and I mean , you know , what &apos;s the name of this apple ?
And you say , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; No . You know , this is El@@ k .
This is two , that the 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the name of this apple ? &quot; &quot; So he said , &quot; &quot; Well , apples . What &apos;s the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; So he said , &quot; &quot; Well , apples , you don &apos;t have names .
The streets are names , the apples just are just un@@ go@@ ked in the face of the street . &quot; &quot; The movie &quot; &quot; White , a bit messy , a little bit messy and an inch .
Now , imagine that you &apos;re on a street of any place in Japan , there &apos;s a person that you have on the side of the side and ask questions , &quot; Sorry , how do you call this road ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the apple of 17 , and that the 16 . &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
See apples .
Google Google here . There &apos;s the apple 14 , 15 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 19 .
All of those apples are names . The streets are just the name of no name among apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know what the hell you know about your house ? &quot; &quot; He told me this : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is it . &quot;
He was born .
The first house would build an apple is the number one .
The second house that &apos;s built is the number two .
The third one is the number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I love how we often have to go on the other side of the world to meet us from things that we are facing by the other side of the world . &quot; &quot; I love it to be true .
Like , for example , there are doctors in China that believe their job is to stay healthy .
So every month that you are healthy , you will pay you , and when you meet it , you don &apos;t know why you &apos;re talking about it in your job .
( Applause ) We think that the problem is the strong weather , the beginning of the music â€” one , two , three , four .
But in the west of the west of Africa , one &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; exploded , &quot; &quot; as the end of an audience .
So let me listen not just at the same way , but in the way you say , two , four , four , one .
And this map is also true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a quote that states that have any real thing that tells you about India , the reverse will be true .
So we don &apos;t forget , so let &apos;s not forget about TED as a place in another place , that for any brilliant idea that we need or listen , the other might be true .
He <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
