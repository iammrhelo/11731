And it &apos;s going to be the end of this year , the next to the <unk> , the person that &apos;s using a <unk> .
They &apos;re going to tell them that they &apos;re going to be able to get them wrong .
Now this is a very mysterious idea , but I think it &apos;s a very strong thing to be , as a kind of a <unk> .
I thought that I was after a job to write a little bit of a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> death death .
The teacher was born , and the friends of the family to write a weekly post to the post that was the one after his death .
So this is what he said at the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s this . I was dead , and that &apos;s my last website .
I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m just going to be my body of my body , my family , and my family , and I &apos;ve been inspired by a message that I was writing as a first piece of my blog from a <unk> in a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And so what &apos;s the thing that the prophet , the <unk> , could be more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more <unk> , on the right , is that all of the things that are all the most heroic ones
A little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little <unk> .
Now , 48 hours of video footage , YouTube is going to be a YouTube video .
<unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> per month .
When you &apos;re talking about your parents or your grandparents , they have made a few <unk> or a different phone , or a video or a <unk> that &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> .
But today we &apos;ve been the most amazing <unk> <unk> that we have to live in a living with a million more than a lifetime of our own .
I think it creates an incredibly advanced opportunity for the purposes of a <unk> .
For a few minutes , I &apos;m not going to be a <unk> , so I would like to be able to get a little bit of a <unk> figure out that the future and the future will be .
We &apos;ve already seen some kinds of things that we &apos;ve been learning to do with our own and our own lives in the way that we &apos;re going to get to our own death and our partner in the way we can &apos;t get the death of our death .
One of them , I can tell one of them , and I found myself in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Adam : <unk> .
<unk> : Adam ?
And this is how .
<unk> : <unk> can you all live in any room at any time , even in the <unk> .
And what is this ?
<unk> : <unk> on the <unk> , when I was a <unk> , it wasn &apos;t too much .
( Laughter ) And so , if you &apos;re a <unk> , or not true ?
This <unk> does not really , and it &apos;s just to create a message or a video that can be translated into Facebook after you can be a little bit of a chance to be able to be a member of your own .
Second , I &apos;ve got a thousand years old .
It &apos;s going to be able to connect the online <unk> and the <unk> , the videos and the connections that they can get after you can get a chance to get a death .
But then it &apos;s only a little bit of a difference .
Many of you probably heard about the Nigerian Society in the <unk> , as he was going to be able to get more than a Christmas hour of a video .
I think that with the ability to be able to understand the human ability to understand the human psyche and the subject of the data , is the best of the data that will be done by the <unk> , the <unk> , the videos , the videos in the <unk> — that we are going to be able to get in the <unk> <unk> .
And I think that &apos;s just a good thing to do , to our own <unk> , to the extent that we can get the best of the <unk> to the <unk> , the way we can get the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the technology that we created , and the technology of the technology that we created , the technology of the technology , the technology that we created , the technology of the technology , the technology that we created , the technology of the technology , the technology that
Now we &apos;re going to go a few <unk> .
There &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> — my <unk> , and he &apos;s going to put all of your records in the <unk> , everything that you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s good for what you could write .
So you can see , the product can be a bit of a <unk> .
Imagine that something like this is going to look at five or 10 or 20 years old , and you can imagine that there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to look at .
And the challenge is , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
And if the contractor could be able to get a <unk> <unk> , a few of thousands of people have a <unk> , a thousand <unk> <unk> that man has created a whole life .
The <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> shot in the United States in 2008 when the New York Times <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What if we could use this technology for the <unk> of our <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ?
I think it &apos;s all possible , and it &apos;s a bit of a solution to the <unk> , and the ability to be able to get into the data that is in the <unk> <unk> .
And I think we &apos;re all going to do it , we &apos;re going to think we should be a bit of a good thing , and if we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and if that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be for the moment , and what that means is to improve life and what we do .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
You &apos;re a little girl .
The first <unk> is from the <unk> <unk> .
The other thing that &apos;s going to do is that they &apos;re from the <unk> <unk> .
We really understand more about the realities of the reality , and we really understand the reality of the Higgs boson .
I &apos;m sorry to say that you can .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk>
The piece of the piece of the universe that you want to understand .
And then you can do it with a little bit of them .
In our offices , we have to have a solution to the Universe that we have in our own , and we have to be able to get to the surface of the Universe .
And these systems are <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the fish , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the
Interestingly enough , these systems are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk>
What about the genetic system ?
As a <unk> , while the traditional behavior of the <unk> , the <unk> behavior of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
And then you try to understand the system that we have , and try to understand the system that &apos;s going to be a good thing to do , and that &apos;s how we can do it .
It &apos;s on the top of that system .
The <unk> , literally , the system doesn &apos;t have any of their parts .
And in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
But why not in the wrong way ?
Where does the electricity ?
We &apos;re going to <unk> on the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You might have heard that no one had seen that no one had seen that no one had seen as looking before you look at that .
&quot; How do they get ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Are they going to be ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are they going to be ? &quot; &quot;
Or , the <unk> , the <unk> .
These are companies working more than one of the things that has been done for 6,000 .
It &apos;s also a network of <unk> and <unk> , a network of 600,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of all the <unk> .
And in the center , the structure of the structure .
But they &apos;re going to take 95 percent of the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But what is the question of what &apos;s going on , and what &apos;s going to be ?
I can make other things as well as possible .
It &apos;s a little bit more <unk> .
And so , as a result , it &apos;s a <unk> net .
and these are the principles of <unk> <unk> , and these principles are <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk> <unk> and these principles of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk>
And I want to argue that I want to focus on what &apos;s going on in the way that we talk about the <unk> .
It &apos;s really about <unk> , when we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I imagine this , you see the scene with a little bit of a piece of paper — like this man , he goes to the <unk> , and he goes to the <unk> , and he goes to the <unk> .
And I imagine that this is not a <unk> , because it &apos;s not a <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> and a <unk> .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s happening with us without our own knowledge .
I &apos;m also going to be a bold and ambitious argument that meant that I was thinking about the words , I &apos;m going to live in a life .
You can tell , and I &apos;d like to argue that a lot of the things that we &apos;re going to do is to get the message that we &apos;re going to be able to get to the subject , perhaps most of them are have a problem .
So love , love , we &apos;re going to get .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> .
We &apos;re going to get rid of the <unk> .
The thing that makes us crazy , and it &apos;s good for us to do it .
<unk> &apos;s heart rate and then you get a <unk> .
So our <unk> <unk> is in a person to stop violence or to be a <unk> .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like this .
And they &apos;re going to take us to the <unk> and the <unk> .
And so , the message of this is &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you &apos;re going to get the positive of this word in a <unk> — ( Laughter ) — you see , it means that it means and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; to be the <unk> . &quot; &quot; As a rule , I was a saying called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; with a very nice lady , with a very good <unk> ,
One of the <unk> <unk> that is in the words of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So we &apos;re going to do that , because we &apos;re going to get a love of love with love , which is the <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> ?
So how did that happen ?
How do we get to the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> ?
And why are we talking about this as a good experience , how do we get ?
It &apos;s hard to do , but I have a few more <unk> .
And so I want to argue that I wanted to be a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> , which is a love of love .
When I first started to teach the kiss of love , I was going to give this one crazy thing .
In the history of the <unk> culture of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s a few examples .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> is just crazy &quot; &quot; is just crazy to the book , &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; is the book of the book , &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; is always the crazy word &quot; &quot; crazy &quot; &quot; is crazy .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to the <unk> , so the <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to go in 20 years old , and it was enough to be able to get good relationships from the early days .
It was a whole new way to come up with a few years , because it &apos;s a very high rate for me and a little bit of a <unk> .
I remember one moment .
I &apos;m going to go to bed in the room in the last year , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go out of my door .
There was a <unk> , almost <unk> , we were going to be able to get into our apartment , and we put our own things in the room and we would have a <unk> .
I wasn &apos;t even looking at this kind of thing , and I was very nervous , remember , as I was going to get it .
I was 22 , that was my first place in the book that was going to be a little bit of a thought that was a little bit more .
I had a week to my house , and I knew the name of the city , which is the city , and the city , I needed to be able to get to the wrong thing , but I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do it , but I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do it .
I wasn &apos;t going to be able to get a little bit of money and so little money , and I had no idea .
And I could get a little more <unk> for me to get this kind of opportunity , but I &apos;m not a <unk> .
I &apos;m just going to just go on there .
And then the <unk> .
But despite my own <unk> , a small voice in my head , he thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> . It was a <unk> .
I &apos;m really excited about the same thing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a feeling of feeling that I had a <unk> experience .
Now that &apos;s really , it &apos;s really odd for me , but I &apos;m in 22 years old , I &apos;ve got a little bit of a <unk> , and I &apos;ve been a <unk> and a little bit of a piece of art , and I thought that it was pretty good , but I thought it was a guy who was a joke , and I thought it was just a guy who was a joke , and I thought I was going to go .
I think , in a way , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , a <unk> , because I thought , that &apos;s so love and working .
It &apos;s not supposed to be a <unk> , a <unk> , that there &apos;s eight songs there , 14 songs , two <unk> and one of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; The <unk> &apos;s Love . &quot; &quot; A few hours later , he went to our apartment .
We &apos;re going to panic .
It &apos;s a real <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; My favorite love is like a joke , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the real <unk> .
But if you look at somebody like this , as a parent , it wasn &apos;t good for me , and it wasn &apos;t good for me or for me or for it .
But I think that the same thing is not very good about this .
Most of us have a little bit of a little <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s actually a <unk> that &apos;s been a <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
It &apos;s really true .
It &apos;s a <unk> 1999 , a <unk> <unk> , so that the rate of the <unk> is very similar to the people who are going to be able to get into the people with the <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So the same thing that &apos;s going to be about is that the same thing that &apos;s going to be done with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
So there &apos;s a few things that love that &apos;s going to be about to be connected to the human spirit and the <unk> .
And other people are concerned that most of the people who are being treated as well .
The <unk> <unk> that was going to be a Nigerian class , a little bit of a <unk> , a bit of a sense of how somebody else &apos;s going to be in the head of the head .
And most of us are going to be like this when we first got to the first place .
It &apos;s usually for a few months to have a few months .
When I came back to my trip to the <unk> , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my room , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my room , and I &apos;m going to ask my little bit of my life , I &apos;ve been a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my room .
I said , if I had my friends , I was not able to understand my mountain , I was going to get them wrong .
So I was a little bit of a deal with them .
And it was probably the most part of my life in my life .
But I think I &apos;m going to argue that I should be a bit of my life , because if I was a little bit of a <unk> , I would be a <unk> , and I would be a <unk> , and I would be a very good one .
And if I would argue that , then we would end up with a whole bunch of things together .
It &apos;s a crazy crazy , because there &apos;s no rule , because there &apos;s a great rule that &apos;s been done by a big deal , but we talk about love , as it would be true .
Our experiences and our experiences , and the labels .
Our critics say that love is good , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the love of the <unk> , when it &apos;s a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
So , you know , you &apos;ve probably heard about this — you &apos;re talking about the <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a little bit of a <unk> from the wrong I &apos;m going to be the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So our culture is a spiritual language to be able to get into the public and to make sure that the love of love .
So we talk about the <unk> , and we talk about the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to talk about it .
It &apos;s pretty interesting to be able to make the positive value .
The <unk> and sometimes we have this idea of our own , and we &apos;ve been able to focus on our own language and the story , and then our story of the story of the prophet and the story of the prophet .
And the interesting thing is that this is all the way in the culture that the <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be able to get the right and crazy &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and we want it to be a good thing .
It &apos;s a toy .
( Laughter ) To that , we need to change our culture , or change our way .
Imagine that we were all less likely to be more than a human being .
If we were more inclined to get more <unk> , more than a new new , more <unk> , and then we would be able to get to love .
I know that it requires a lot , but I &apos;m not the first person that I &apos;m going to do that .
The book &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; is the book that we live in &quot; &quot; <unk> Mark <unk> and George <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be able to be able to do , and even though they can &apos;t be able to be able to adjust our own assumptions as a <unk> that is the ones that are stagnating .
The teacher and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of art .
I love this way to write about this thing .
The creator told that the <unk> <unk> , which is essentially the way to connect all the things , or the ideas that are going to be in the <unk> .
The teacher and the creator told the story that the conversation was about the <unk> of art , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And these ideas are good for good , and they &apos;re also working in the public health care system , but they also work in other ways , and they &apos;re also working in other ways , and they &apos;re also working in other ways that they &apos;re going to have a lot more positive ideas to experience their hands .
So if love is the ultimate art of art , love is a self-fulfilling experience of the art .
<unk> <unk> , love <unk> , love requires <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And love with the <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> , every single experience of the <unk> .
When I was a <unk> , it never occurred to me that it wasn &apos;t going to be the most important thing to love .
When the first time you get the first old , or if you had a <unk> , you couldn &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do anything .
Where does it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Right ?
And as a <unk> , we have a moment of <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
He &apos;s a <unk> , he &apos;s going to just run out of the <unk> .
I understand that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when I read this <unk> , I read this <unk> , and I was 14 years old , and I had the meaning of the meaning for me .
The love of love is something I &apos;m going to do with the person who is not just that I &apos;m going to be able to do with my own , but I &apos;m not just going to be able to do anything with me , and that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be a powerful thing .
But that &apos;s still hard .
The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , and when I feel a bit of my life , I should be able to ask myself , my job to do this , is to speak up , to my partners , to talk to me about what I wanted to do .
It &apos;s also a <unk> .
But it &apos;s much better than the second one that &apos;s love , the loving love .
This is the third thing that &apos;s not about to be able to do , or the <unk> .
Instead , it requires a good partner and a good thing to do , when it becomes difficult , that it &apos;s hard to get it to the right , that it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s actually a <unk> <unk> .
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and how to do that , or not to be able to stop thinking that you &apos;re a <unk> .
This one is going to allow us to say things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not good at all . We don &apos;t have the good things for us . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s not for us .
Or , &quot; &quot; These relationships are <unk> than I &apos;m going to be , but it was great . &quot; &quot; And the great thing about the truth is that he &apos;s not a genius , that he &apos;s not a genius or not to himself .
This is the first one that we can do , how it &apos;s going to look at what it is going to look like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was going to go on a trip to a trip to a trip to a city of <unk> , which is in the city of <unk> , which is in the city of <unk> , which is in the city of <unk> , which is in the city of 5,000 miles .
You know , it goes when you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go , and we &apos;re not a car , and the most ardent of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> path .
And I was going to get a little bit of a <unk> , and I was going to be honest about that , and I was going to be a little bit of a conversation about that .
&quot; What is this for a <unk> ? &quot;
Her eyes on his forehead .
And so what &apos;s happened is that the original hand is very accurate now that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the <unk> , and she &apos;s going to go on a few weeks , and then I was a little bit of a few more <unk> , and then the <unk> , because the excitement of the beauty of the fence , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , because the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
I was about that .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s this kind of thing , this is a <unk> room for a <unk> . ( Laughter )
In the last five years , I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about this , which is why we sometimes understand the way we know the way we know , and how we &apos;re going to be a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to focus on the human being .
I &apos;ve been talking about , I &apos;ve been spending the last five years in a conversation about the Nigerian state .
I have a career in a career that you can see , but it &apos;s a big deal of a big deal : that &apos;s a competition in the room .
( Laughter ) Now , most of us would be from a very good idea from the idea of how we &apos;re going to be concerned about their own , or not the way that we think about the ability to be able to do their own .
We know that we know .
We realize that sometimes every single person in this room is a <unk> .
We are people , we &apos;re going to be smart . Okay , so let &apos;s say .
But when you look at the right , I have this time , and I have been doing this for this time , and all of the sudden , there &apos;s a very strong idea of the human being , and the other side of the <unk> , and the <unk> I can &apos;t imagine that the <unk> .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this 30-year time .
We have a <unk> on the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be the same thing to do with the same thing , and it &apos;s going to be a good thing to give you a voice .
In the clinical care , we &apos;ve all been going to be able to live in a life of a belief that we are always going to be right .
It &apos;s a challenge to me .
And I think that &apos;s a problem , and each of us , on a personal level , or a cultural level , and we all share a society .
What I want to argue today is that it &apos;s a great deal because we &apos;re going to get the <unk> of our own <unk> .
Secondly , that &apos;s why this is the idea of the <unk> approach .
And I want to argue that maybe you can &apos;t take a sense of the <unk> of the <unk> , and if you &apos;re a libertarian , it &apos;s the best of all sorts of things that are in the arts and creativity that you can do .
So why are we going to get into the <unk> ?
The one is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s take a bow , you can , because you &apos;re going to go together , you &apos;re going to get wet ?
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> . Excellent , great , great .
The <unk> , with the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re all the answers , but they &apos;re going to focus on the other question .
You ask the question , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the sense of the feeling of the <unk> that you &apos;re not going to be . &quot; &quot; You ask , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the sense of what you &apos;re not going to do , &quot; &quot; you ask me , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the sense of what the sense of that is you &apos;re not going to be . &quot; &quot; You ask the question , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the sense of the feeling that you &apos;re not going to be wrong . &quot;
( Laughter ) The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , as they were going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s been a whole , not ?
For example , maybe a sense of how you feel , or the sense of the kind of thing that you &apos;re seeing , or even the sense of the feeling , as I got to the same sort of <unk> .
But the state of the state is not a very clear of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
Remember the <unk> companies of the <unk> , where they had the <unk> <unk> hour , but the <unk> didn &apos;t get wet ?
Almost everything in every single one of this is going to be on the same thing that the <unk> would be able to do with the <unk> , and the <unk> that is not the same thing that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , because the <unk> is the <unk> , and the <unk> .
But every time you get a cliff with the rocks of the rock right now .
What &apos;s wrong , especially when you &apos;re just six years old , is what it is for granted .
It &apos;s just continuing to be a <unk> , and it wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> , and it wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> .
So this is why he &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
When we &apos;re in a sense of a bias , we don &apos;t know that the things that we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to be able to get the <unk> , and then we &apos;re going to get the <unk> .
The <unk> , we &apos;ve already been surprised , we &apos;ve been able to get this kind of thing , but we still feel that we &apos;re still seeing in the ground .
I have to tell you what I &apos;m saying is I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a <unk> .
There &apos;s a sense in the <unk> , the sense of their own .
( Laughter ) The conclusion that we have to do with this idea is we &apos;ve got to be able to get our own <unk> .
I &apos;m going to make this a little bit of a <unk> .
We have no idea of a <unk> , that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a <unk> , if we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
There &apos;s another reason why we &apos;re going to get to this point of the story , and it &apos;s more tolerant of our culture .
Imagine a <unk> school .
You &apos;re going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a number of them .
In fact , it &apos;s not .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s how you &apos;re going to be in school and you know that we think of thinking about what &apos;s going on .
He &apos;s going to be a <unk> and he never does it .
So , even though , as a result , you &apos;ve learned that , the people who are <unk> , the ones that are the ones that are being intercepted , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the orangutans to succeed in life , and never be a <unk> .
We &apos;ve done these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Most of us , and I think , especially in this room , the way we &apos;re dealing with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Or , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s the same thing , right ?
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re all the kind of things that you &apos;re going to do , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and you &apos;re
The future will be .
The only thing that &apos;s going to do is we &apos;re going to be able to get into something that we might be in a certain way .
Because the thing that &apos;s going to happen is that if we do the idea of the dangers we &apos;re going to do , we &apos;re going to make something wrong with us .
And so we &apos;re going to focus on our own , because we feel like we feel like , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Let me tell you about an incident .
Several weeks ago , the name of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a hospital in a <unk> .
And this was a <unk> <unk> student who was one of the <unk> students , and he &apos;s one of the things that I had in the hospital .
A few years old , a woman &apos;s been born and turned into a room .
It &apos;s a <unk> under the <unk> , and he was able to get her into her <unk> and her her mother &apos;s room .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , says , &quot; &quot; Why are I going to be the wrong thing ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why are I going to be the wrong thing ? &quot; &quot; And the reason that the guests did it , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , not the <unk> .
When this young man , I had a <unk> , he said something very wrong .
&quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; he was just working on the <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why , I &apos;m about it , because the belief that the dangers of the things that you &apos;re going to have on the wrong end of the solution , maybe it &apos;s a very good thing .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we all look at , we &apos;re going to see , as we &apos;re going to see , as a <unk> , what is happening in the world .
And when we &apos;re in our own <unk> , it &apos;s just about the opportunity to be able to do something about the ability to be able to do something about the ability to be able to make a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a huge problem for the <unk> .
But that &apos;s also a problem that &apos;s been a problem for a society .
<unk> on the counter is that it &apos;s a sense of their own .
That means that your own <unk> is the dominant reality of the world .
So with this , the problem is that the people who are concerned about people is that you &apos;re going to have to be a little bit of a bit .
And so , we believe that most of us are being inspired by people with other people &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first thing we think is , if somebody is us , it &apos;s not a belief that they don &apos;t have to be able to do anything .
They don &apos;t have to have any information that &apos;s in your mind , and if you &apos;re a bit of it , you &apos;re going to get them to the point of the information , and they &apos;re going to be able to get them to your own .
If that doesn &apos;t happen when we realized that they were going to be the most ambitious and we don &apos;t have to go on the side of the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to get the ones in the other side — that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do .
( Laughter ) Before they &apos;ve got to have a lot of money to get the marshmallow , they can &apos;t be able to get it .
And if that doesn &apos;t work , if we realize that people are not the ones that we are not aware of , the ones that we have to be able to do , we &apos;re going to be able to get the wrong thing , we &apos;re going to know the truth , but for their own , the ultimate truth , but for their own , the truth , but for their own , the truth , the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s a disaster .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
What I &apos;m more interested in is the most mysterious , I think , is that this is something that is absolutely about as a human being in our human psyche .
The placenta , we want to believe that our own selves is the ultimate <unk> , that we can get them to see and the appropriate thing to do with the <unk> .
And we want to be able to get the same thing for the most exciting thing , and there &apos;s the exact same thing .
It &apos;s the same thing , and it would be incredibly <unk> .
The idea of our mind is not that we can see the light of the world that is there .
It &apos;s what we can see the world &apos;s not as well .
We can have a conversation about the future , and we can imagine that we can be more different in other places .
It &apos;s because every eye of the eye , we can see the most of the most pressing areas that we see in the world and see that , and that &apos;s , and that &apos;s .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re going to be a <unk> .
And in about 1,200 years of being able to shake their way through the words of the gay self , I think , &quot; &quot; I think and the printer &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; written by &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be the <unk> and the printer . &quot;
The conclusion that we have to realize that the fact that our <unk> is not the ultimate <unk> system , is not something to do for a good thing or a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> society .
Because we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know what in this world .
We &apos;re going to get the animals from other animals , we &apos;re going to try and try and try and try and do that light .
I think that this is a <unk> , and the ultimate and the <unk> of our own <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> , I started to listen to a lot of the <unk> applications , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> life . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> life .
I &apos;m listening , listen , and I started telling you that all of the things that I &apos;m talking about is a little bit of a <unk> .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , the thing that I thought was , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Now I always always , like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m always crazy .
It seems to me everywhere . &quot; &quot; The <unk> was the same .
But after the months , I have to take a chance to interview , I &apos;d like to interview a <unk> program .
I was going to get this one out of it , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really what it is . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s really what I &apos;m going to do .
It &apos;s a statement that the software that has been tested even though is the most frightening thing to do is the most frightening thing .
It &apos;s like this : &quot; &quot; I thought this is something that &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s really happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is that , &quot; &quot; the thing is , &quot; &quot; What is it that we need to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is that we need to do that .
We need to be so bit of a bit of a bit of the <unk> and the <unk> , so we can bring these kinds of things together , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , in the same way , in the same way , the ability to be able to make sure that we are going to be able to do that .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s the kind of thing that we do , we &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of a mess .
But you know , our own things are so important , because we are our lives .
We think that &apos;s going to be true , and it &apos;s actually going to happen .
George Bush thought that the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it was really an accident .
And also , the creator of Mubarak thought that the ultimate act will be the end of their life as not as a coward , and then the <unk> , and the <unk> of the son &apos;s son .
And it was really an accident .
And so you &apos;ve got to think that the <unk> and the teacher with the schools , and the teacher and the teacher and the teacher and the <unk> .
And it was really an accident .
I should argue that I was a little bit of a book , which I write a book , something that &apos;s not going to be a good thing to do , to the subject that you don &apos;t have to be .
And it was really an accident .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a life .
We &apos;ve been able to focus on the ideas of the world , which is to be able to do that — to the better , the <unk> — not . And the light is the <unk> and the <unk> .
Not a <unk> , but the whole idea of the race there is a very strong human being in the <unk> .
We &apos;ve been a <unk> <unk> , a whole week of innovation , and the labels and the <unk> , but you know why we need these innovation , and the innovative and the <unk> ?
Because half of the ideas that were crazy , and there was a real life to change the light , and the ability to change the light — the <unk> at the TED Conference , which is what &apos;s right there .
( Laughter ) Not a <unk> , or not so much ? ( Laughter )
Where are my <unk> <unk> ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re going to go over here .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
We &apos;ve got another idea .
We &apos;ve got another story .
We &apos;re going to go in a next one .
The <unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ve heard , are seven million times , as a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , if you really want to be a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re going to get out of this chaotic and changing space of your own and <unk> space and more and more and more and more and the news of the Universe and the answer to the Universe and the answer to the Universe and the prophet and the <unk> and the <unk> of the Universe and the answer to the Universe , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Danit Peleg : ( Applause )
Five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At first , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , he started to <unk> the <unk> , and he had the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Fortunately , these plans were the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But I &apos;m sorry to forgive you , in the midst of a <unk> , a <unk> center of the Swiss Embassy .
And I had a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in a <unk> , <unk> , and I had a <unk> , and I had a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and a <unk> , and a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
But when I was born , I was born in our family , and I started to get a little bit of a <unk> .
My father showed me that one of the things that you see is a little bit of a <unk> , because there are most Muslims .
My experiences show that if people are invited to one of them , they have a lot of time to realize that in the real way we want to think in the real thing we want to do .
But in every single <unk> , every single person has a small <unk> , a few people who are so empowered to have their own <unk> , that the more people that feel the best to make the difference to make other people live in their own .
A few months later , a father who had a friend who had a friend who had a friend of mine who had a friend of mine who had a friend of mine who had a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> .
He said that the next thing I &apos;m going to do with it is .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
And that day , my last year , I had a little <unk> in a small <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s also a <unk> , and especially my most recently , the most important of the British flames .
My <unk> friend &apos;s friend &apos;s friend and he said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the father , the father , the son .
They &apos;re all very hard to do with this , but only a few years later , I realized that it &apos;s all the meaning of it .
They saw the same thing as a parent , a little bit of a piece of the thing that was my father .
And the result of the people who had been arrested for the <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a thousand percent more than a thousand .
These were men who are the men who are going to be .
<unk> people , I &apos;m going to <unk> , which means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means .
I &apos;m going to be a place for 20 minutes , and that &apos;s my kid &apos;s child &apos;s opportunity to make me the opportunity of a friend of friends .
Every time I started to feel a moment in the same room , an hour of the time to get more things and more and more to get the other person .
I was always born in the classroom , and I was often a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve been able to get my own business in a way to get my attention to my attention , but as a kid , for a new child in class , I was going to talk to my career , but as a kid , I was going to be a kid in the classroom .
And I got a good game .
And what I mean , I think , is that my social skills were really , really , really , really , really , really , really , the best thing to do with the human life .
I was inspired by the people who were inspired by the <unk> <unk> , as a lawyer or race .
What &apos;s going to tell me ?
The first of the subjects that the first challenge that was given was that the original mindset was in the <unk> <unk> year .
I was able to put a program in a <unk> way to get a <unk> in a <unk> .
The <unk> of my group was the violence .
Members of our groups are the most different layers of the public .
One day , I think , I &apos;m going to tell you that one of my new friends was a <unk> .
Because this is a few days of a few days of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
I had never had friends of friends before , and I &apos;m thinking , I &apos;m going to argue that I was a <unk> bar that I had a <unk> , which I had a coma for almost a whole life .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> was a village in the <unk> <unk> Park . It was a park of a park .
I &apos;ve been going to bring people all around the world and cultures , and that experience is fundamental to the fundamental people of my personality .
I wasn &apos;t a good thing to do with this .
As a scientist , I &apos;ve been able to be able to do something that was possible for me to be able to do something about the next few years , and I quickly realized that many of them were a little bit of a bold and I quickly realized that many of them were a little bit of a bold and more creative , and I quickly realized that many of them were a little bit of a bold and more creative , and I quickly realized that many of them were a little bit of a bold
I got a little bit of a <unk> , and I had a sense of being able to get to my sense of honor and to give me a sense of the other good people , and I would have been able to get to the other people &apos;s good people , and I would be able to get to the rest of my good people .
It &apos;s a sense of a little bit of a <unk> , which I was in a kid with a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was
I &apos;m going to be wondering how it is to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going
And then the <unk> <unk> , and every single one of John <unk> , who had John <unk> me to be able to be connected to myself about my own own selves and telling me that race , the race , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of anything .
And so many of the assistants have been made of me , which I &apos;m going to do with this , which is what I am like , is that I &apos;m so excited about this .
And so often , the teacher &apos;s often , the <unk> , the <unk> , I know that the <unk> of my <unk> , the more <unk> I &apos;m going to be .
And one day I was talking to my mother about how I started to write my mother , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a man in my heart .
And so she looked at me and I had a look at the eyes of the eyes and the more than enough to be able to go , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do the people . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do the people . &quot; &quot;
I realized that I was going to be able to get the power of energy to make this kind of thing to look at themselves .
Zack <unk> is not my name .
I &apos;m going to put it in my family when my family was , and I started to start making a life .
So I would ask you to get my own <unk> and I would ask myself to be a cardiologist ?
Well , that &apos;s simple , that &apos;s simple .
I do this work in a way that someone else has a dream of a story and a dream that I had rather a lot of money , and I don &apos;t know , but I wasn &apos;t a very good job .
Instead , I would take my experience from the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
I do this for a good job for the <unk> and for them to be loved , and they &apos;re also getting a lot of pain on their own .
So memory is a conversation about how I &apos;m talking about these kinds of things that I &apos;m going to do with these kinds of things , and I &apos;m going to talk about these kinds of things .
I &apos;m a group of a group of things that violence is not a single person &apos;s being a person &apos;s , and that son is not going to stop the gates of my parents .
I &apos;m not a father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . Every one of you . ( Applause ) Thank you so much . ( Applause ) Thank you so much . ( Applause )
Or it can be a problem with a child , or a kid , and it can be a better way to do it , or to give them a better sense of what it might be like , or to give them a better sense of what it might be like , or to give them a better sense of what it might be like , or to give them a better sense of what it might be like , or to give them a better sense of what it might be like , or to give them
and they &apos;re not the best for the other .
You can help make a big difference in less than a little bit of a <unk> .
When I was a <unk> , I would argue , if I was a <unk> , I would like to get a little bit of a <unk> , and if I was a <unk> , I would like to get a <unk> , and I would like to get a little bit of a <unk> , and if I was a <unk> , I would like to get a <unk> , and I would like to get a little bit of a <unk> , and if I was a <unk> , I would like to get a <unk> ,
And where my favorite , I had my <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; When my friends are going to be a kid in my <unk> , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> man in my <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be my <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be my <unk> , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , &quot; &quot; in my <unk> , I was going to be a <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going
And I &apos;ve done a lot of the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s not there .
So the way that you look at the question is , the question is , the question that you should be told about a few options , because the reaction that we should be told is a little bit of a problem , because you can see , you know , the reaction that you should be told about a few more things , because you can see , you know , the reaction that you should be told about a few more things , because you can see , you know , the reaction that you should be
But it &apos;s not possible .
When the good good is , it seems to be a good idea , but it seems to be a very mysterious idea .
And then , on the next hour , and so forth .
The career , a career , a career , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have a career to you .
We have a <unk> <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk> , we have a <unk> , and we have a <unk>
When you get to the <unk> , you &apos;re going to get to the <unk> , when you &apos;re going to get a <unk> , if you &apos;re going to go on a <unk> , if you &apos;re going to go on a <unk> , if you &apos;re going to go on a <unk> , you &apos;re going to get to the <unk> , if you &apos;re going to go on the street , if you &apos;re going to go on the street , you &apos;re going to get a <unk> , if you &apos;re going to go on
You &apos;ve made a beeline for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a beeline for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a beeline for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a beeline for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense of identity for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense of identity for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense of identity for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense of identity for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense of identity for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense of identity for
It &apos;s a <unk> , or the interaction we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to make a beeline for , and we &apos;re going to
I &apos;m the one who love the <unk> .
When we get to the <unk> , we are going to be able to get to ourselves , and if we are the most important thing we are .
You &apos;re going to get the most important thing to do .
Several years ago , I decided to go to the path , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan
I was a <unk> <unk> through these <unk> .
Instead of being arrested , the <unk> wasn &apos;t going to be more <unk> than a few months old .
This one was from my grandfather when I was doing it every day .
I never had a <unk> , I never got to the <unk> .
I &apos;m also going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk> , and I &apos;m also a <unk>
In fact , the way that the <unk> <unk> is not to be sleeping , you don &apos;t have to sleep to bed , because the way that they &apos;re going to get to bed is not to be ready to be sleeping , because the contrary to the contrary to the contrary to the contrary , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
But the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
I &apos;m not going to say that I &apos;m going to go , &quot; I &apos;m going to go on the <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to say that I can say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> . &quot;
I realized that when I was doing a little bit of a change , I realized that I was going to be able to do that , because they &apos;re not going to be able to do that by the same thing that they &apos;re using .
They &apos;re actually <unk> .
( Applause )
I was incredibly nervous in the world that the world had been a <unk> in the world to be a <unk> .
In 1975 , when I was a year , women in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , whether they had a place or a place to be a little bit of a kind of crazy thing .
They &apos;ve been published in the <unk> <unk> <unk> — 90 percent of women — and they asked them to ask for a question .
The student wasn &apos;t working in the wrong day , because nothing works when women are not .
( Applause ) A few five years later , the Iranians had a chance to become the first ingredient in the world , which is the equivalent of the <unk> path of the woman &apos;s child .
I will never forget that day when the president was born , and I was going to get the same day , and came back to the balcony of his house , and she was going to come from the couch , and then she was going to be on the balcony .
( Applause ) It became a <unk> <unk> for me and every one that was growing up in that hour , including the <unk> .
She often talked about a story about the book that she would put in front of a few people on the page and said , &quot; &quot; And the <unk> can also be the <unk> , if you &apos;re going to get wet ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The Higgs boson really is a matter , but even with the same power of a <unk> , which I was like , &quot; &quot; Who am I so so comfortable , so if I was offered a <unk> , I was like , &quot; &quot; Who am I so
Who am I so comfortable with that to be a good thing ? &quot; &quot; And the women are less than the <unk> who are less than men .
The U.S. was in 2011 in 2011 , the <unk> , the 62 percent of men &apos;s loans to their <unk> , but only 45 percent of women .
We &apos;re going to see 16 percent , and that &apos;s the case that the <unk> is not so much fun .
It &apos;s a real superpower , because I &apos;m not suggesting that it &apos;s going to be a lot of a good leadership and more legal leadership .
Because my decision to be able to do something that I &apos;m going to do is to make a decision to make my own <unk> , even without the <unk> <unk> , to walk forward and try to take that to the world that will be able to have meaning and to be able to make the meaning and to make the sense of what we want to do and the good things that we want to do with it , and the good news is that they want to be .
It was to take a trip of my life .
It was wonderful .
The first student came from 20 <unk> <unk> .
And then the rate of the number of <unk> , the number of nine , followed by the <unk> , and finally , the race of the day , the two men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the drama of the drama .
You know , you &apos;re wondering , you know , the United Bang is the greatest drama , but I can tell — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we are in the <unk> <unk> .
First of the last 20 years , the president of the last 20 years , the idea that it wasn &apos;t about the <unk> , it was perhaps the key to the <unk> .
Then he was going to be a <unk> , and he was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was the family he had to do .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because the president of the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> .
And a few days of the connection with his family , and her family had been also turned into a <unk> , and she was also going to be in the <unk> .
Before the <unk> , he said that it &apos;s good because there are two men who can become their own <unk> <unk> .
So nine minutes of the day , in the course of 45 days , the right thing to do is not quite good .
I don &apos;t even have a place in the room for a <unk> .
I was one percent of the <unk> , and I was one percent , and it was a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> said that I had to take all the steps to get my place for the <unk> and get my place for the <unk> , because the <unk> decided to be able to get a half a half percent of the voice on the first <unk> .
On the day , these were the most ardent of the <unk> that I would be able to do with three women , and I would argue that it &apos;s only two and two percent in the day of the day of the day .
( Applause ) And the thing about the puzzle .
The problem with which we have to be able to do with the same thing and to get into that journey , was to be connected to the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> .
Some of the things that are made of a <unk> is a <unk> for the <unk> and the <unk> .
You can &apos;t get wet .
I was just turned out to be able to get access , and I was just going to be able to get access to the media .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , the thing that &apos;s going to do is I got to the media that &apos;s in the media , a few months before I was in front of the book , and I was there for 31 times in the same time .
And I don &apos;t want to say that the good thing is that it &apos;s going to be a good thing .
I mean , I &apos;m not suggesting that the reason in the world is a great deal of media , because in the media , the media is a legal and <unk> , and we have to get the message to the next , and we need to be able to change the way we want .
When I was able to get access to the TB , the first question is , &quot; Are you going to be able to do this with a <unk> ? &quot; &quot; That was a question of a question .
The message , from one minute to come from one of the two to two percent of their voice to understand .
But the media is really a matter , and every time I &apos;m in the TB , we saw that I was in a hurry , and we &apos;ve seen that I &apos;m not going to be able to do that , and why we should be able to deal with this .
I had a little bit of a <unk> <unk> , never at the first <unk> .
I was a <unk> of the real question that I had to do with all the other things that are going to be the opposite of the rest of the world .
I &apos;m going to get it to this , but I &apos;m going to tell you a great media .
There was no one in the world who had no longer any of my own or <unk> .
( Applause ) The Dodgers will be a <unk> .
But there &apos;s another very important experience .
I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , without a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> .
This <unk> experience and access to the resources , perhaps the most important , the good , the good , the good , the new things that we do , but also to make a difference .
Our company was a <unk> , and we , maybe , changed the tone for others .
Mo is the reason for a lot of money , because I wanted to show you a little bit of a bit of a bit of a <unk> .
If we have access to the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> the information .
I &apos;m going to go on Facebook , and I &apos;m going to focus on Facebook questions for a little bit of a sudden .
All the things that we have to do with the original , we &apos;re going to put on Facebook , because we were in the <unk> <unk> , when we were the <unk> <unk> .
When I was born with a <unk> of young young men , I started using a camera .
I mean , I &apos;m going to do that , and I would argue that I would take every single step in the career that I had ever seen in the museum of a company .
I really have a lot of fun and more creative and more <unk> , because I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a lot of fun and more and more , because I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a lot of fun and more and more , because I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a lot of fun and more creative and more <unk> , because I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a lot of fun and more creative and more <unk> , because I &apos;m going to
But it &apos;s also growing up in the number of <unk> frauds .
It &apos;s a new way to give a company and a way to do .
I &apos;m sorry to tell you , you know , you don &apos;t know the money and I don &apos;t worry about money .
And it &apos;s not that , but it &apos;s true , and it was the less powerful resources than other people .
The reason is partly that the reason is that , in my view , the time was a piece of a piece of the puzzle , and it was a little bit of a <unk> .
And maybe I &apos;m going to make a little more of the <unk> .
Some of you may be very optimistic that it &apos;s very good .
But even with the media and the <unk> and the <unk> , and only the <unk> , we had a whole bunch of people on the afternoon , when we first got the first numbers .
I &apos;m going to shake myself myself as you can see on the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So the first data of data I was going to do was I was going to be a <unk> with a <unk> .
( <unk> <unk> ) Well , too , I wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> , but we &apos;ve taken a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> , and we &apos;ve been going to be able to get the same thing to the next few pieces of the voice , and we were going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the results were 10 percent of the <unk> in the past .
And so I had this amazing thing to do with this , and I &apos;ve been inspired by a lot of people who have been inspired by the same time .
But actually , I &apos;m making a beeline for a little bit of a <unk> , that I &apos;m going to be able to get more sophisticated than the other people in the morning , and the biggest number of people that I &apos;ve done in 2040 , 2040 .
( Applause ) Now she &apos;s 13 , and she never had been on TB .
But in the afternoon , I was going to be a <unk> , and she was a <unk> , and she was a <unk> , and she was a mother of her mother .
<unk> , that was the ultimate <unk> of my company .
( Applause ) But it was another one .
The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
This one is already for me .
We can do anything that &apos;s going to be visible .
Yes , fear and problems .
( Applause ) The rest of the world &apos;s needs , and it &apos;s time to be a woman &apos;s time , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> person or a <unk> .
I also got to the New Yorker , and I got a new <unk> , &quot; &quot; New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I got a new quote : &quot; &quot; The New Yorker &apos;s <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , this is my most ardent <unk> , because women too often have a lot of people who are too often trained in the <unk> <unk> , as I &apos;m going to be able to do , but I know that we &apos;re just going to be wondering if we do it .
( Applause ) And we have to do more .
On a day , we &apos;re going to be a <unk> , because we felt like we were .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You have to go to this , and you , you , I &apos;m going to be friends and I love , everyone who will work with you if you &apos;re a good thing to do , that the person has been born .
We &apos;re good for the right time , and I &apos;m going to be able to make sure that I could take a trip to that , more than I can tell you on the <unk> .
But it was a bit of a challenge .
I had a little crying of all these things that I had never slept .
And so the reason that we can &apos;t get into the <unk> and the <unk> , and I realized that I knew that there was another day in a day with one of the things that I had , you know , just like , when you &apos;re going to get the wrong person and the person who had a voice to do with this kind of voice .
Now , the good good news is , you know , your good good , you &apos;re going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re going to be able to do it , but you never want to do it .
I want to be a bit of a bit of a bit , and you all know , any of your own favorite , that &apos;s your team .
People are both around the values and the <unk> , but the way they &apos;re going to go in .
For me , this is a challenge , I &apos;m a curious wonder that I &apos;m going to be a good thing to do today , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do today , and we &apos;re going to be able to look at the <unk> and we &apos;re going to make something , but we &apos;re going to be able to do something , but we &apos;re going to be able to do something , but we &apos;re going to be able to do something , but we &apos;re going to be able to do
And I think that &apos;s a little bit of a quote from a <unk> , and a little bit of a decision to tell you how I was going to be good when I was seven percent .
I put it in a position of a visual perspective , because it &apos;s a very good thing to be true , and it &apos;s also a statement to the story of the <unk> .
But one day I was a very keen to show that he &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
It &apos;s very important to be that I &apos;m really missing and I &apos;ve been crying and I worked with a lot of people with me .
We never have to do a lot of it when you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a look at ourselves .
I think it &apos;s really important to be really important to two things : the people who are willing to make you , but not less important than it is , if you don &apos;t have a more , more likely to be able to get the people and the people who are willing to share your own , including the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to be a little bit of a few other people , and I was not going to be able to focus on the <unk> , partly because of my power , and I have been on all the time .
When I was a <unk> , it &apos;s an hour of time , because it &apos;s an hour of time , because it &apos;s a <unk> , I &apos;m not just going to be able to do it , but my own <unk> .
I called our own company <unk> , where the G stands for , and the P , the <unk> , the <unk> .
The first one is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , I &apos;m going to be a good job of the leadership , and I wanted to be able to teach the leadership as a <unk> for a human job .
Another word is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or a <unk> .
I was a <unk> <unk> .
And it was a lot of a lot , and it was a little bit more like this , and it was a little bit of a <unk> .
And I &apos;ve been a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to get it to the other .
<unk> words , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was a <unk> for all of the things .
I wasn &apos;t a <unk> , and I could tell you about Facebook or our websites .
I think that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , you ask the answers to your questions .
The more important words that we have in this room is not to be a <unk> company , we &apos;re going to be a company called <unk> <unk> — the power of the power .
( <unk> ) I &apos;m really excited about finding that a little bit of a piece of money to get to the finish line , but it &apos;s great for the great things .
I can &apos;t tell you what was simple , but I &apos;m not a very good thing , and I think that &apos;s the story of my team , and it was a self-fulfilling <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat <unk> : I &apos;m not going to give you a little bit of you . ♫ ♫ Have a good good . ♫ ♫ Have you to do it , not the <unk> , but I can &apos;t give you a little bit of it .
I mean , maybe it &apos;s in the room to be prepared to be a bit of a <unk> and a little bit of a free person behind you .
We &apos;re not going to be able to have a voice to tell you , but there &apos;s something that we can take to be able to take a sense of what we &apos;ve seen before , and we &apos;ve never been able to do it before , it &apos;s a <unk> .
I mean , it &apos;s enough that it &apos;s enough to remember that it &apos;s a long old to remember , when women were born on the street , and it was really a <unk> <unk> , and it was really a <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to be able to look at this little before , and you can see the <unk> of the <unk> , and you can get the <unk> that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
And you can see the evidence that the media is not going to be able to do that , but in the way that women are going to get the same thing , but in the next few years , women are coming back on the street . Right ?
TBP : So , PM : Can we tell us about this ?
<unk> : 41 years from now , we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> , but we &apos;re going to be able to do this with a <unk> .
So , the <unk> , the women who have a good job in the workforce , because that hour , they &apos;re going to get their own <unk> .
( Applause ) So what happened was that the <unk> and the young people who were going to be able to have a little bit of a <unk> , because the time it was , because the time was the time that was passed on a <unk> .
PM : I &apos;m not going to be able to do this with the right thing , but I &apos;m going to say that you &apos;re going to be a big fan of the <unk> , if you &apos;re going to do that again .
Thank you , <unk> .
<unk> : Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , I tried to think about my career , and I &apos;ve been trying to think about this , and the best example I &apos;ve ever been on is the New Yorker , and the best example I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to be in the New Yorker a couple year ago .
The <unk> <unk> , you look at the Pentagon , says , &quot; &quot; Dad , if I &apos;m grown , I want to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m a <unk> , a huge <unk> as a Nigerian president , because I &apos;ve got access to the world that had been left in the world who had ever been to meet people from the world .
I &apos;m not just going to be 50 percent in America , but we &apos;ve got to leave the world with more than 50 percent of the world &apos;s world , but we &apos;ve got to leave the world with more than 50 percent of the world &apos;s world , but we &apos;ve got to leave the world with more than 50 percent of the world &apos;s world , but we &apos;ve got to leave the world with more than 50 percent of the world &apos;s world , but we &apos;ve got to leave the world with more than
We &apos;re not just going to be able to do with a bold or <unk> , but also the <unk> of the <unk> that live in the most violent business .
It &apos;s the most powerful person , and it &apos;s the most powerful thing that I know , and I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I can tell you that I can tell you , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s violence over women and zeros .
There are some other causes that I &apos;m going to be .
And so , as a result , this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
They &apos;re going to bring these scripts to realize that women are equal to the women &apos;s names compared to men in the <unk> of God .
Several years ago , 2000 , I was a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , and I was going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> — but the <unk> <unk> in 2000 , the <unk> , the men of the men .
So they &apos;re going to be the same , which is essentially a political issue to be a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a woman in a room , or a woman in a classroom where a woman &apos;s sitting in the classroom in a room with a <unk> , she can &apos;t get a little bit of a <unk> , and in a way that you can find out that the woman &apos;s going to be a good person in the room , and in a more responsible way .
But it &apos;s what the media is going to be like , that &apos;s what the <unk> <unk> can be done in a more powerful way .
It &apos;s a problem because men can be able to have a power , such as , as a husband , or a <unk> , and a young woman who is willing to be willing to choose to be born .
So why should I pay them for a good job for a good job ?
The problem is that the problem is the ultimate <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the problem , the <unk> .
The United States , for instance , we had a <unk> increase in the <unk> , and the people who were going to be buried in the <unk> .
One of the 1,000 Americans in the room is in a <unk> .
Now , we have a thousand <unk> in a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> increase .
And since I left the house , I had an increase in 800 percent of women in the hospital in a <unk> .
We &apos;re one of the most iconic things we &apos;ve seen in the world , and I had a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be one of the things that we &apos;re going to do with the first one that is the most important thing to be done with the character that the most common thing we &apos;re going to do with .
We &apos;re now in California , and I was a little girl in the other day that I had a <unk> , four dollar dollars on the 13th of the <unk> .
The person on the floor is the person .
And the <unk> that was sent to this paper that the British law , which is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the more the same as the women who are on women &apos;s rights .
I &apos;m going to be pretty good at this .
And they &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> .
But in the countries , many countries , in many countries , when they &apos;re born , they &apos;re going to be able to live in her life , and they will be able to make it feel so hard to get into her life , and that &apos;s the kind of thing that my mind was doing , the way that they &apos;re going to get to the end of the <unk> .
A little bit of a <unk> , a little bit of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a more <unk> , a <unk> , a more <unk> , a more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more
And then she &apos;s married , and he &apos;s going to be the same thing to be sex with , and it was her sex .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not a law , and it &apos;s not a good thing , and it &apos;s not a law , it &apos;s not a law , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s not a legal thing , it &apos;s
<unk> , for example , 91 in all women who live in the present today , were the <unk> <unk> .
In the countries of countries that are more than 98 percent of women who are willing to do that .
It &apos;s a great deal for all women who live in countries .
The other thing that &apos;s really good is , the one thing that I &apos;m with , is nothing to do with the <unk> , that the <unk> is the person who was going to marry or she was born or she &apos;s married or she &apos;s married or she &apos;s in favor of her family , and she &apos;s been humiliated or when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s going to marry or even when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s going to marry or even when she &apos;s going to get married or she &apos;s in the
It &apos;s going to be the first of their family , and so I become a kid , when the girl was born as a young woman in a family .
Not so much of the <unk> of the <unk> was in the <unk> , and it showed that 75 percent of these women were <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> or 25 percent of the women &apos;s female .
The problem that we have in the world is in a very common world in the world , and it &apos;s slavery , or the people who are known as it &apos;s called .
About half the million people were born in the world &apos;s light in the dark world , in 18 cents .
30 million people live today in slavery today .
The U.S. Capitol , the U.S. government , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the women who are going to have the <unk> of slavery .
In the United States , it &apos;s about 60,000 people living under the domestic or slavery .
Atlanta , the <unk> , where the <unk> , where I &apos;ve been involved in a <unk> , between 200 and 300 women , people are going to be the most competitive , and 300 women , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people , the people
It &apos;s a room for one of the things that I &apos;ve seen .
The <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has a lot of <unk> , and the <unk> has
When the Iranians are willing to be willing to choose to be a bit of a dollar that &apos;s in my own business , which is my ability to do that for 1,000 dollars .
The young girl who had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> can be done by a $ 1 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , Wyoming , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
So that &apos;s another thing that &apos;s going to be a good problem because there &apos;s no way to get a problem in America , and it &apos;s a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> , or a <unk> ,
It &apos;s a place to be in a way to the Iranian women , women are <unk> and <unk> all the world .
So I &apos;m going to have a good approach to this .
So , for 15 to 15 years , the consensus of the law and women are more effective than the law when they were born in the midst of slavery , but the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> went down .
In the United States , we have , in the United States , and , in the United States , we have , in the United States , and , in the United States , we have , in the United States , and , in the United States , we have , in the United States , and , in the United States , we have , in the United States , and , in the United States , we have , in the United States , and , in the United States , we have , in
On one of the other things that was born in the United States , 25 women were born in the United States .
Canada , the <unk> , I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , the <unk> and the other country &apos;s <unk> right now .
This is a friend on the right , which can be done .
We have two big holes in our pockets , our own <unk> and our <unk> system .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ,
The <unk> <unk> that I did , says , I was in a <unk> .
The 3,000 , more than one , and the reason is that the government is not the same as the <unk> , the one that &apos;s like , the <unk> , or the <unk> in the <unk> , or the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> of the law , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the past , that they want to be able to do that , they don &apos;t do it .
This law has to be a <unk> .
I will be a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m now a lot of <unk> , partly from my book , and from other things , that &apos;s how it &apos;s in the U.S. and the other parts , and it &apos;s due to 89 <unk> in America , because the <unk> of the individual who is willing to protect them from the domestic violence .
The <unk> <unk> says , on the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , because they &apos;re going to be able to put on somebody else , but when they &apos;re going to be a <unk> , they &apos;re going to be on the top of the campus .
They don &apos;t get wet .
These things that are going to be in our own business .
It &apos;s a very good thing to be like , &quot; &quot; The <unk> on the right in the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s the little bit of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk>
When I became a <unk> , a student was a 39 <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to get the <unk> <unk> , and so forth — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 hours in the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening now .
If you take 500 companies , you &apos;re 23 of them , and it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , I &apos;ll tell you that the only way that I &apos;m going to tell you , the only way that I &apos;m going to tell you , is that the opposite of the other is the opposite .
It &apos;s what &apos;s happening in our own .
The other problem with the <unk> <unk> , we are the most <unk> we are on the planet .
We are going to be a war in war since World War II .
Our grandparents were in the place of the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to go on the <unk> , we &apos;re going to get the bomb to the people .
<unk> , of course , we have a <unk> , and we have a few of them , of course , we have a <unk> , and we have a few of them , and we have a great deal of the story .
We were going to be a war in 25 different kinds of pathologies , and we &apos;ve been in the World War II .
For years of age , I &apos;m going to be like , we don &apos;t have to say , we don &apos;t have a lot of money — ( Applause ) — we don &apos;t have the bomb bomb .
But in any case , the things that are going to be wrong and the <unk> of the religious <unk> , the primary principles of domestic violence .
The other one is the reason that the men &apos;s , the men &apos;s men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
The guy who can tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s very similar to what I was like , if you &apos;re a little , and a little bit of a <unk> .
The <unk> of the world &apos;s face , the World War II between the war , the World War II , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> rights .
But for this time , there were many white people who didn &apos;t believe that they were the ones that were broken , but they &apos;re not supposed to be because they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> operation , and it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to be , because the <unk> is the most important thing that we have today , because the <unk> <unk> , the truth , is actually , in fact , that the <unk> is actually , because the <unk> <unk> , the reality , the reality , is actually
Even when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not using the <unk> of the <unk> .
The most important system that the system is , most of the men who are going to be the system , are most men who are going to be born in the world , and most men who are going to be more competent than that , and most men who are going to be very good .
Is it a good thing to do today ?
I would say , the best thing that we could do for women with the most important thing , and how you can be wondering , and how do you get to the people that have to be willing to take care of themselves to be more comfortable to end up with the more things that are going to be more comfortable to end up the world .
I had no idea what to tell you what to tell me to tell the woman in the woman &apos;s room .
But I hope that after this scenario , women are going to be able to have their own scores , their scores on college campuses and their own future , and in the future , we need to protect our own <unk> and <unk> .
I have 12 minutes of kids and 10 , I often think of them , and the other thing that I &apos;m often thinking about , and the other thing that I &apos;m going to do is , you know , if they &apos;re going to be a good thing , and I hope that all of you are going to be a good job for women around the world , and we protect them right .
Thank you so much .

When I was a <unk> , the future of the world &apos;s life was a <unk> .
The growth of the population was not going to stop .
The <unk> <unk> was a <unk> .
The cancer of cancer , the <unk> in the background , was going to be the same for the world &apos;s life .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> would be the <unk> .
The first one is not there . ( Laughter ) But I was not going to be able to do that , because the people who are on the average of the population on the average of the person on the street , in a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk>
I had a <unk> life in 30 percent .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on two third .
It &apos;s a <unk> , a million per capita .
The only <unk> that became more ambitious , as a <unk> , is how they got to the <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> shows per capita .
To answer that question , you have to understand how the <unk> is going to be able to get their own and the ability to communicate with their own <unk> and <unk> , and the ability to communicate with their own <unk> and <unk> , and the ability to be understood , and you need to understand how to the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
In other words , you have to understand how ideas are going to be sex .
I want you to imagine what we were going to be able to do with creating a product to build a <unk> .
Over 30,000 generations .
The Victorians , and some changes , the <unk> , the skeleton &apos;s been the skeleton in the clock .
It &apos;s a huge phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s just about five years old in the last five years .
The teacher is going to be the same .
I &apos;m going to have a little bit of different <unk> , from the same way , from the <unk> and the <unk> .
And more than that , with the idea of the ideas , the ideas of the laser , the ideas of the laser , the ideas of the laser .
They were all pragmatists .
And that &apos;s a great deal of technology that I &apos;m thinking , because I think that &apos;s the key to realizing what &apos;s happening in the world .
The brain is also the <unk> ideas : the idea of the <unk> , the idea of the brain , the idea of the brain , the idea of the <unk> , the idea of the <unk> .
They &apos;re going to go together .
How do you get a better <unk> or a cardiologist ?
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
The white species , if you have two different different kinds of <unk> in different contexts , in different contexts , in the same way that they &apos;re going to have to have different kinds of different types of <unk> , in the same way , is the <unk> species .
One is a little bit of a <unk> .
The species of the most powerful people that we have to get into the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So this is the same thing that we have to do with the individual <unk> innovation .
It &apos;s not a good personal , negative personal .
So , what is my mind that &apos;s going to be the same as a <unk> revolutions that have been in a <unk> ?
I think the answer is , it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , a little bit of a different kind of stuff .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> doesn &apos;t do that .
Culture can be no longer .
Maybe we should be a <unk> culture .
<unk> , <unk> culture .
They teach one of the things that were going to be removed from parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; family .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s not that easy to be in the same way that you &apos;re going to get in the same way .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in different contexts .
They don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
So why is the idea of the fetal being ?
The answer is to be born in the year of the year .
And it &apos;s also a representative of his belief in the 20th century that he was also going to be able to get into the <unk> between the <unk> .
Adam <unk> <unk> for four hours and three hours .
Oz <unk> for one hour and she &apos;s going to go on two hours .
Oz is the best for Adam and <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> Adam <unk> .
It can make his own <unk> and <unk> .
If you &apos;re a black lady , Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> , two <unk> , two <unk> , and Adam <unk> ,
It makes sense for the <unk> , and so forth .
Adam and Oz , you know , you &apos;re going to get your time .
And you know , as long as long as you were going to work , you would have to work on , and you would have to work on the next few years , and I think that &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> book .
When you get the first thing , you have to get a little bit of a <unk> .
How much is that you &apos;re going to be wondering ?
How much will you ever be working on a few hours of a week to get a good job for a paper when you &apos;re going to get a <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You &apos;re going to go on a half of your feet in the comparison of 1950 .
You would be 15 minutes to get the price of the price of the <unk> on the average .
You should be working six hours to get a ride on a screen to get a little bit of a ride on a screen to the next to the <unk> , which is a little bit of an hour .
So back to the <unk> and the question of the question , &quot; Who did them for whom ? &quot;
The <unk> on the right on the right was made for me to do some other people .
How much happened that someone did it ?
<unk> ? Is it a cardiologist ? Am I going to get ?
You know , I think there &apos;s a million .
I can make a beeline for a <unk> for me to make a difference for me .
And that &apos;s the way that the community works .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with a kind of a flavor .
<unk> hours , if you were a cardiologist , people were very keen on you .
They were going to be able to do it , and they would be able to do that , and they were going to be able to get the same thing , and they were going to be the same thing in the same way that they were going to be in the same way .
<unk> people were <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> that was going to be able to do with the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
They &apos;re in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get the same food as they &apos;re going to give you a little bit of a meal after the <unk> , the quality of which you &apos;re going to have to be able to do with the same thing , the quality of which you would be able to do with the <unk> , the quality of which the quality of the race will be .
They &apos;re going to maximize the standards of each other .
There &apos;s other things that work with one on one .
<unk> is a little example .
<unk> is a <unk> .
Even though we don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) So , if the behavior started ?
It &apos;s a very good job of working .
But I don &apos;t have that .
There is a new job for the food that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
The men are born and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And I don &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And he knows that he doesn &apos;t need to be a <unk> , so that &apos;s the <unk> .
And everything that I should be , like , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> ,
And the reason that we didn &apos;t have that .
They were highly specialized .
They were very smart .
But there &apos;s no idea that they had a good job of doing it .
There &apos;s no more <unk> than women .
They said women are going to be connected together with men .
There &apos;s no way to the <unk> between the <unk> , because the <unk> are among the <unk> , because the tools that they did , they &apos;re always made with a <unk> .
For example , there &apos;s a place where the <unk> is the place where the <unk> device is .
They &apos;re always born with a <unk> .
And that same thing has been the same as a modern , modern people , and the same thing that we have to do with the same thing , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the
When the person started to be able to get a bold interest in this , it was a reminder that they &apos;re not going to be the same thing that they &apos;re going to do .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in Africa where we see that the <unk> , the <unk> and the other <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And then the <unk> — as a <unk> , was going to be a <unk> , a half kilometers of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what the groups started to do .
And that led to the <unk> .
They &apos;re going to get them to get into the same thing as a <unk> , and they &apos;re some sort of <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re also some kind of <unk> <unk> .
What happens when you get people from the wrong way , from the ability to get the oppressed and the opportunities ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not just a good thing to do with a <unk> , but it can even be a <unk> in the <unk> .
The complexity of the thing is the thing that is being done .
The teacher &apos;s dying rate of people with the same thing they &apos;ve had to do .
Because the population in 4,000 , the world &apos;s population had not enough to sustain the skills that the world has been to be able to do for the first .
The worst thing happened to be born on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> — the worst of the <unk> <unk> <unk> — the worst of the <unk> <unk> <unk> — the worst of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> — the worst of the female superheroes were not the same for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The reason that the <unk> is the equivalent of the <unk> <unk> of the American American , much more <unk> .
The good thing was to be .
So let &apos;s go back to the <unk> and the <unk> , not only who did this for a person who did it for a person , but who knew how to do that ?
No , there &apos;s no one , literally .
A person on the <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t know .
I was a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to do , &quot; &quot; which he had a <unk> , and that no one knows how to make a difference , because people who don &apos;t know how to do the wrong things , because people who don &apos;t know how to do that , because they don &apos;t know how to do it .
What we did in the world is the way we &apos;ve done in the <unk> , the path of the <unk> and the <unk> — we created the opportunity to make things that we don &apos;t even know .
It &apos;s not what &apos;s in the language .
But when you do this technology , the technology is in the technology , but when the technology is solved , the technology is the technology of the technology , but the technology of the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology
In fact , I &apos;m not going to be a <unk> , a way to look at the level of the public , or the <unk> , the groups of the most ambitious groups than other groups .
It &apos;s not my own <unk> .
And the <unk> has a matter of good ideas , and how good they are , and they &apos;re not the same as common as common one .
We created a <unk> brain .
We just put in a <unk> .
We are the neurons that are brain neurons .
The mental ideas , the ideas and the ideas that one of the other people &apos;s favorite , the <unk> , the step , step for the <unk> .
It &apos;s not less than that , it &apos;s not that way .
So we &apos;re going to get ahead , we &apos;re going to get rid of the wrong things .
The war of war , depression , <unk> <unk> .
The other thing that I &apos;m going to do in this century is I &apos;m absolutely sorry .
But I &apos;m also convinced that the wealth of the people who are going to be the ability to get people &apos;s ideas and the opportunities that are really good at all , I &apos;m also convinced that technology will be a little bit more complicated than I &apos;m going to be able to do .
Because in the way , through the <unk> , the next to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
Thank you .
