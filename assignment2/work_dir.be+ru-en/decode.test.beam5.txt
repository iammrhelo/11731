Yes , it &apos;s going to be about the end of this year , and it &apos;s going to be the end of this year , the person &apos;s going to be using .
They &apos;re going to tell them what they &apos;re doing .
Now , this is a crazy idea , but I think it &apos;s a very powerful thing to do , the old things that we need .
And I thought that I was going to be able to write about this , and I was going to be able to do that in the way that I was born with cancer .
Her family was a friend of his family and friends to write a late-night interview , which was a parent after his death .
That &apos;s what he said at the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s this . I died , and that &apos;s my last website .
I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be my body of my body , my family , my family , and my friends , and my friends , I &apos;ve been talking about how the first piece of my blog was going to be able to get better , and I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a <unk> that would be a good thing to do , and more <unk> , and more <unk> , on the right , is that all of the things that are going to be better than that ,
A little bit of <unk> .
Now , 48 hours of video footage , YouTube videos are uploaded to YouTube .
<unk> 200 million hectares .
<unk> <unk> <unk> generates 90 <unk> per month .
When you &apos;re talking about your parents or your grandparents , they have made a couple of <unk> or different types of videos or videos or videos that are going to be in the <unk> <unk> .
But today , we &apos;re going to have a tremendous amount of <unk> <unk> that are going to live in a living way to live a lot of our deaths .
And I think it creates an enormous amount of opportunity for <unk> .
For example , I &apos;m not going to be disappointed , so I &apos;m not going to be able to make a sense of what I &apos;m going to do , and that &apos;s what the future will be .
We &apos;ve already seen some kinds of things that allow us to decide what we need to do with our memories , and we &apos;re going to be able to get to our own death .
And one of them is one of them , and I found myself in a way that I was going to get into the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> ) Adam : <unk> .
<unk> : Adam ?
And so .
<unk> : <unk> can take you anywhere at any time in any time , even in the <unk> .
And what is this ?
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; yet &quot; &quot; as I said , &quot; &quot; Not yet .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s not true , right ?
Now , this <unk> does a very simple thing to do things , to create a message or a video that might be based on Facebook after you &apos;re going to be there .
Second , I &apos;ve been diagnosed with a thousand years old .
It &apos;s going to allow the Internet to look at the <unk> <unk> , the videos and the videos that they may be able to get after you &apos;re going to be able to get the risk of a death .
But then it &apos;s just a little bit of a difference .
Many of you may have heard of the Honey , which is , as he <unk> <unk> , as he <unk> a little more than a child in a video .
I think , with the ability of machines to be able to understand the normal language , and I think it &apos;s a data that will be possible for a data , and it becomes possible for a data to be able to live in a whole life — <unk> , <unk> , videos , videos , <unk> , <unk> — that we &apos;re going to be able to have a <unk> .
And I think , as soon as it is , for our <unk> , it will be possible for us to be able to make a sense of how we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , because we have to be able to do this , and the technology that we &apos;ve created , and the technology that we &apos;ve created , and the technology that we &apos;ve created , the technology that we &apos;ve created , the technology that we &apos;ve created ,
Now we &apos;re going to take a couple of polygons .
There &apos;s this kind of <unk> — my <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> all of his records in the <unk> , everything that you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s good for what you could write .
So as you can see , the product can be done .
Imagine something that &apos;s going to look at five , 10 or 20 or 20 years old .
Now , we &apos;ve been going to take a step forward , and it &apos;s going to work on the web , which is how people are going to make people .
And if you could be able to have a <unk> <unk> , a handful of thousands of people who have created a lot of thousands of people who have created a whole life .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> from the United States in 2008 , in 2008 , when the New York River <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what if we could use this technology for the <unk> of our <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that they made , as they lived ?
I think that it &apos;s all possible , and it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do with the data that we have , and that &apos;s the ability for them to be able to get the data to the <unk> .
As a result , I think we &apos;re all going to do it , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it ? And if that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to do for life , and what that means is that it &apos;s going to be true for life and what &apos;s going on .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
You &apos;ve heard a little bit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first <unk> is from the <unk> <unk> .
The other one is from the <unk> <unk> .
We really understand more about hyperbolic reality .
I &apos;m sorry to say this .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a piece of the reality that you want to understand .
And then you can do that , and they &apos;re going to go .
I mean , we have to be able to deal with the smallest of the Universe that we have in our lab .
And this is the system of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Interestingly enough , these systems are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What about the genetic system ?
It &apos;s like a <unk> behavior that &apos;s like a <unk> behavior .
And to try to understand the system of the system , and try to understand the system , and to try and understand the system that we can do , and that &apos;s what we do .
It &apos;s the system .
<unk> , literally , it doesn &apos;t matter from their parts .
It &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> .
But why isn &apos;t it going to be ?
Where does the electricity ?
We are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
You can see that no one had seen that no one ever looked at .
&quot; How are they going to be ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Do they get wet ? &quot;
Or , you know , <unk> .
These are the companies that have been working more than one hump , and there &apos;s 6,000 .
It &apos;s going to be on the <unk> , and it &apos;s a network that 600,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of all the <unk> .
It &apos;s in the middle of the structure .
But they &apos;re going to take 95 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But how do you answer that ?
It &apos;s going to make other people to do it .
It &apos;s going to go through the <unk> .
And this is the same thing , and it &apos;s a <unk> net .
and these are the principles of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
To tell you , I want to focus on what &apos;s going on in the way that we &apos;re talking about .
In fact , we &apos;re talking about this experience when we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I imagine that , if you imagine that there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a picture of this , it &apos;s like this man , he goes to a <unk> , and it &apos;s not a <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
And I imagine that this is so , because it &apos;s not the case .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s happening with us without our knowledge .
I &apos;m going to go and I &apos;m also talking about the English language , which means that I &apos;m talking about , I &apos;m going to live in a life .
You can say , and I &apos;d like to argue that a lot of the things that we &apos;re going to have to be able to do , is perhaps even a large part of them — have a challenge .
So love , love .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> .
We &apos;re going to get rid of it .
It makes us crazy , and it &apos;s good for us .
<unk> hearts and then <unk> .
So what we &apos;re going to do is , we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to lose sex , and we &apos;re stagnating .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
And they &apos;re going to take us as a little bit of <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; by saying &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you look at the positive of this word in a <unk> — ( Laughter ) — you see , it means that it means and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — you see , it means that it means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; with a very , very angry party .
There &apos;s a little bit of <unk> <unk> on the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the words of the <unk> <unk> of God .
( Laughter ) So we did the same words to celebrate love with love , which is called <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> ?
So how did that happen ?
How are we going to be able to do this with a little bit of <unk> and <unk> ?
And why are we talking about this as a good experience , how do we cheat ?
It &apos;s hard to say , but I have a couple of <unk> .
And so that &apos;s what I want to do , and I want to give you a little bit of <unk> , which is the love of love .
When I first started to study a kiss of love , I would argue that this was crazy everywhere .
In the history of the <unk> culture , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s a few examples .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> is just a crazy word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) There &apos;s always a crazy thing to do that &apos;s crazy .
I said , &quot; &quot; Look at me , you know , I &apos;m going to get rid of the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m going to go in 20 a year , and it was enough to be done in 20 years old .
It was a lot of relationships for the first few years , because it &apos;s a very high rate for me , and it &apos;s a very high <unk> and a <unk> .
I remember one moment .
I &apos;m going to go to bed in the room in the last year in America , and I &apos;m going to panic , as I got around .
It was a <unk> , and it was almost <unk> , and we went into our apartment , and he was going to turn his stuff into our apartment , and he made it different .
I wasn &apos;t looking at it , and I wasn &apos;t looking at it , and I was very nervous about how I was going to make it .
I was 22 , that was the first part of my mind that I was going to be a very , very one .
I was going to go home to my lunch house , and I knew the name of the city , which is a city that I needed to be able to do , and I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do it , but I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do it .
I didn &apos;t have a lot of money , and I had no money , and I had no idea .
And I could make sure that I could take it as a moment of opportunity , but I &apos;m going to panic .
And I &apos;m just going to just get there .
And then you get a <unk> .
But even though I had a little bit of a little voice in my head , a small voice in my head , he thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> . It was a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be able to do that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m going to take a little bit of a sense of self experience in a hoodie .
Now , this is really odd for me , but I &apos;ve got a little bit of a confession for me , but I had a little bit of a <unk> , and I had a little bit of a <unk> , and I thought , it &apos;s pretty surprising , but I thought it was pretty good , but I thought it was a joke with a joke that I had just left .
I think , in a way , I &apos;m going to be able to be an outsider , because I thought it &apos;s so love and works .
It &apos;s really not supposed to be a <unk> , because there &apos;s eight songs there , 14 songs , two songs and one of the <unk> and one that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> Love . &quot; &quot; <unk> hours later , he went to our apartment .
We <unk> .
It &apos;s a real <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; My favorite love would love to be like crazy .
But if you look at somebody in this way , it &apos;s like a little bit of a <unk> — it wasn &apos;t good for me or it &apos;s for me .
But I think this is not a very good type of thing .
Most of us , we have a little bit of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a belief that it &apos;s not a <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s not so easy .
It &apos;s really true .
It &apos;s a <unk> , 1999 , <unk> <unk> , so that the rate of autism is going to be very specific to the people with the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s also the same thing that &apos;s going to be done with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So there &apos;s a couple of <unk> that love that love to be connected to us with our <unk> and <unk> .
And the other thing that you know is that most of the things that most people have done in this way .
And so what &apos;s interesting about this is that the high income rate in the middle of the conversation is that it &apos;s a little bit of a sense of what somebody else has ever seen in their head .
And most of us , as we get older , is when the first time was .
It tends to be many months for a few months .
When I came back from my trip to my trip , I spent a lot of time in my room , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my room .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not able to understand that when my friends can &apos;t understand the mountain .
So I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of them .
And it was probably the most part of my life in my life .
But I think I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be honest — that &apos;s my job , because if I was an outsider , then I would be able to do it .
And if I would argue that , then we would end up with all kinds of things together .
It &apos;s a crazy crazy thing , because there &apos;s no rule , because it &apos;s not a big rule , it &apos;s a great deal with a great deal . But we talk about love , as it would be true .
Our experiences of our experiences and our peril .
Our critics say that love is good , and it &apos;s a good thing to do with our <unk> , and she says that love is good , if you &apos;re a <unk> or a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , you &apos;ve probably heard about this — you &apos;re talking about this , you know , you &apos;re talking about the <unk> , you know , that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
( Laughter ) So our culture is going to be a compassionate , so that &apos;s going to be good enough to get into love .
In this case , we talk about the <unk> , and it &apos;s crazy .
It &apos;s a pretty interesting thing to do .
And we &apos;re going to look at it and we &apos;re going to focus it through our own language and the story , and then our story , and the story of our story , and the story that we have to do , and the story of the story that we have to do .
Interestingly , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the culture , which is the <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to go down and crazy , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
It &apos;s condescending .
( Laughter ) To do that , we need to change our culture , or change our way .
Imagine that we were all less likely to be healthy .
If we were more ambitious , more innovative , more <unk> , and so instead of being able to stay in love with love , we would be able to do it .
I know that it requires a lot , but I &apos;m not the first person that I think it is .
The book &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the book that we live in &quot; &quot; <unk> Marc <unk> , &quot; &quot; and George <unk> , and George <unk> <unk> the solution of this <unk> .
They are <unk> , and they can &apos;t even be able to be able to tell our stories as individuals , as the ones we know .
It &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , a new <unk> , a new <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> art .
I &apos;m very happy to think about this way .
And it &apos;s told that it &apos;s not a good thing to say that , by the way , and there &apos;s a way to look at all the things , or the ideas that are going to be in the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> tell the story that they were talking about , and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And these ideas are good for the good news , and they &apos;re also going to work together in other relationships , but they also work in other ways , and they &apos;re also working in other kinds of ways , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ideas .
So , when love is , it &apos;s the <unk> art of art , love , love experience .
<unk> <unk> , love <unk> , love requires <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) And love is a bit of fun and <unk> .
<unk> , every single one of the things that we do .
When I was a <unk> , it never occurred to me that it wasn &apos;t going to be able to love .
When you get the first time to the first place , or if you could not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be there with four days ago , she wasn &apos;t a <unk> or a <unk> .
Where does it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Right ?
And as a <unk> , at the time , at the time , we &apos;re going to have a little bit of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
He <unk> , he <unk> , it &apos;s just a little bit of it .
I understand that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when I read this <unk> , it &apos;s also about 14 years old , and it was the meaning for me .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with me , which is not what I &apos;m going to do with me , and not what I &apos;m going to do with me , is that I &apos;m not going to be able to do anything with me , and it &apos;s a huge force .
But it &apos;s still hard .
It &apos;s about <unk> and <unk> , and when I feel that I &apos;m going to be wondering : May my job in these things , I have to speak with my partners , what I wanted to do .
It &apos;s also <unk> .
But it &apos;s much better than the second <unk> that love love is crazy .
This is a version of the book that is not based on the <unk> , or the <unk> .
Instead , it requires a little bit of a partner with a partner , and she &apos;s going to be able to get better than it is , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s actually a <unk> <unk> .
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and whether you &apos;re thinking about yourself and how it works , and to start thinking about what you &apos;re going to do .
And this is the same thing that &apos;s going to allow us to say things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not the good ones . &quot; &quot; Perhaps that &apos;s not for us .
Or , &quot; &quot; These relationships are <unk> than I am , but it was great . &quot; &quot; And so it was great . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what it was like . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what the truth is , the beauty of the truth is that he doesn &apos;t mind whether or not anything .
And this is the same thing that &apos;s going to allow us to figure out how to look .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was going to go on a trip to another , and I was going to go on my hometown of <unk> , and that &apos;s what I got in my hometown of <unk> , which is a city called <unk> .
You know , it goes , you know , you &apos;re going to go , and you &apos;re going to go down , and we don &apos;t have a drink , and we &apos;re the most ardent of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And I was going to go back to 3,000 miles , and I &apos;m going to go back and talked about what I was going to be like in this room .
&quot; What is it for a <unk> ? &quot;
Her eyes on his forehead .
And so what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s going to be very accurate now that it &apos;s going to be done right now .
( Laughter ) And so I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; which was a little bit of a couple of <unk> , and then I got a few more <unk> , and then I got a little bit of a <unk> , because the excitement that she understands .
That &apos;s what I am .
( Laughter ) Here he is , it &apos;s a <unk> room for the <unk> . ( Laughter )
In the last five years , I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about this , which is why we &apos;re looking at understanding our understanding of ourselves , and how we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to look at ourselves , and that we are concerned about human beings .
To mention , I &apos;ve spent the last five years that I &apos;ve spent the last five years a year .
I &apos;ve got a career in a career that you can see , but it &apos;s a big deal with a huge <unk> competition .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us are going to be from the wrong way of thinking about their own identity , or whether it &apos;s not to think about the ability to be able to do it .
We know this .
We realize that we &apos;re going to look at each other in this room .
We are people , we &apos;re going to <unk> . OK , let &apos;s say .
But when on the right side of me , this time , I was going to take this time , and all of the sudden , all of this is going to be a very good idea of the human psyche , and I can &apos;t imagine that it &apos;s not possible to imagine .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this 30-year time .
We &apos;ve got a little bit of <unk> at the same time , and it &apos;s going to be good at the same time , and it &apos;s going to be the same thing to do with our voice .
In order to survive , we &apos;ve all been going through life in our lives , and we &apos;re always going to be right .
So this is a challenge .
In my view , this is a problem , and each of us , on a personal level , and we all share a society .
What I want to argue today is that it &apos;s a great deal because we &apos;re going to be able to do this with our <unk> .
Secondly , that &apos;s why this is the idea of a <unk> approach .
And I want to suggest that I want to argue that maybe you can take a little bit of a bit of a <unk> <unk> , and if it &apos;s true , it &apos;s the best of all sorts of different things in the arts and creativity and creativity that you can do .
So why are we going to be able to do this in the <unk> ?
And one of the things that we &apos;ve seen is a little bit of <unk> .
Let &apos;s look at you , you know , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of <unk> , you know , if you don &apos;t get wet ?
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> . Okay , good , great .
<unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re all pressing the answers , but they &apos;re responding to another question .
And you ask the question , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the sense of what you &apos;re not going to do , &quot; &quot; you ask , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you &apos;re not going to do . &quot;
( Laughter ) Now , the good news about this is to make sense of experience , as they did , and the whole whole thing is , not ?
For example , you might be able to have a sense of whether or not the sense of whether or not even the sense of that , but even the sense of what I &apos;m going to do with my own <unk> .
But the state is not very clear about the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is here .
Do you remember the <unk> companies of the <unk> , where you have a <unk> <unk> hour , and a little bit of a <unk> <unk> ?
Almost that , in every single one of the things that is going on in every single one of the things that we have in front of the cliff , and it &apos;s a little bit of a cliff , because it &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , and a <unk> .
But every time you get a cliff with a cliff right now .
What &apos;s wrong , especially when you &apos;re just six years old , is what it is to do .
It &apos;s just going to be the same thing as it does , and it wasn &apos;t going to look at it , and it wasn &apos;t going to look at it .
So this is why he <unk> <unk> .
If we &apos;re in something called something , we don &apos;t realize that we &apos;re going to be able to understand that we &apos;re going to get a little bit of <unk> , and then we &apos;re going to get a little bit of it .
<unk> , we &apos;ve already been surprised , and we &apos;re still going to look at it , but we &apos;re still looking at ourselves in the ground .
I have to say that I &apos;m going to give you what I said .
There &apos;s a sense in the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s the sense of their own .
( Laughter ) Now , we &apos;re going to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of <unk> .
You know , we don &apos;t have a little bit of an outsider , if we don &apos;t have a little bit of a <unk> .
There &apos;s another reason why we &apos;re going to get closer to that , and it &apos;s more tolerant of our culture .
Think about it as a <unk> school .
You &apos;re going to be <unk> , and you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it .
In fact , it &apos;s not .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re going to do school , and you know that we think of thinking about what &apos;s going on .
He <unk> and <unk> , and he doesn &apos;t do it .
So , well , there &apos;s been a few more people , and you &apos;ve learned that , you know , the people who are <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be successful in life , it &apos;s never going to be done .
So we &apos;re going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> .
Most of us , and as I think , especially in this room , it &apos;s been treated by the way that we &apos;re treating the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Is it a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s the same thing , right ?
( Laughter ) So , you know , you &apos;re all the kind of stuff that &apos;s going to be like , you know .
I will be .
It &apos;s only when we look at what we might be in a certain way .
Because in this sense , when we do that , when we do it , we said something wrong with us .
So we &apos;re going to focus on our own , because we look at ourselves , we look at ourselves , and we look at it .
Let me tell you about an incident .
A few years ago , the janitor &apos;s name was <unk> <unk> for a woman &apos;s name .
This is a hospital .
And this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> student , and it &apos;s one of the things that I &apos;ve seen in <unk> .
A few years ago , I was going to be born in a room .
It &apos;s a <unk> suit , and she &apos;s going to go on the floor , and he went down to her and her mother &apos;s room .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and he says , &quot; &quot; Why are I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why are I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not a good thing to do with it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not on the <unk> .
And when I was talking about this , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , if this was a little girl , he said something very wrong .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; he felt that he was working on the <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why , I &apos;m about it , because it &apos;s because the belief that you &apos;re going to be able to make sure that you &apos;re going to be able to do something that you &apos;re going to have to do .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we all look at , we &apos;re going to look at what &apos;s going on in the world .
And when we &apos;re in my own <unk> , it &apos;s just not thinking about the opportunity , and we don &apos;t even think about it , we &apos;re going to do something like this , and we &apos;re going to make a <unk> , <unk> million hectares of <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a huge problem for the <unk> .
But it &apos;s also a problem for a society .
It &apos;s a <unk> that means a sense of their own .
And that means that your own <unk> is the opposite of the reality .
In this case , it &apos;s a fundamental challenge to people that you &apos;re talking about .
And what we &apos;re saying is that most of us are going to be inspired by people with other people , and we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> .
The first thing we think is , if anybody of us , we think , is that they don &apos;t have to worry about .
They just don &apos;t have access to that information that you have , and when you do that information with them , they &apos;re going to go back and forth .
If that doesn &apos;t happen , when we realized that they &apos;re going to be brave with us , but we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to get in the other side of the <unk> — that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
( Laughter ) Before they &apos;ve got all the things that they need to do , they can &apos;t be able to do it .
And if that doesn &apos;t work , when we realize that people are not the ones that we don &apos;t know , the ones that we don &apos;t know , the ones we know , and they &apos;re pretty good , we &apos;re going to know the truth , but for their own <unk> , that &apos;s what the truth is , but for their own .
It &apos;s a disaster .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not giving us mistakes , especially when it &apos;s true , especially when it &apos;s true , and we can connect us to each other .
What I &apos;m more interested in , I think , is that I think that this is something that &apos;s going to be like , it &apos;s something that has nothing to do with our human psyche .
<unk> , we want to believe that we &apos;re going to be able to believe that we &apos;re going to have a sense of what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
And we &apos;re going to be able to look at all of the things that we &apos;re going to do with , and see what &apos;s going on .
That &apos;s the same thing , and it would be incredibly <unk> .
Our mind is not that we can see the light of what it is .
It &apos;s what we can see there is not that way .
We can have a conversation about the future , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine that we are other people in other places .
It &apos;s because all of the eyes that you see in the way that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to look at the world and see that , and that &apos;s , and that &apos;s .
It &apos;s because we &apos;re going to panic .
You know , 30 years in the same way , as a <unk> , I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to do this , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to do this with the <unk> <unk> .
The conclusion that the fact is that the fact that our <unk> <unk> is not the <unk> system , it &apos;s not something to do for the <unk> or the <unk> .
These are the things that we do .
Because we don &apos;t God , we don &apos;t know that in this world .
<unk> other animals , we &apos;re going to try and try and do that light .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s about our <unk> and our <unk> .
<unk> , in different contexts , I started to listen to a lot of public applications .
I &apos;m listening , listen , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m listening , and I &apos;m going to talk to you that all of them are about <unk> .
At first , I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Now , I always always , as crazy , can see .
It seems to me everywhere .
But after a few months , I had the opportunity to take a interview in a <unk> program .
I &apos;m going to get it to him , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really what I &apos;m going to do . &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not even obvious that it &apos;s in every single end .
It &apos;s like this : &quot; &quot; I thought this is something you can do about this , and it &apos;s really happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is that , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s an interesting thing to do . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s what we need to do .
We need to make sure that we are going to be able to do so well , and we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re all in the audience , in the same way , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with all of us , in the same way that we &apos;re going to make .
We have the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What we do is , we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a <unk> .
But you know what we &apos;re going to do , because we are our lives .
We think it &apos;s going to be true .
George Bush thought that he had the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it really happened .
Similarly , Mubarak thought that would be the case for the rest of their lives until the rest of their life , as not as a coward , and then the <unk> , and the <unk> of the son of the son .
And it really happened .
And so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the thought that they were going to come from school from the schools , and they &apos;re going to get into the <unk> , and as a parent as a parent .
And it really happened .
I have to tell you that I &apos;m going to argue that I was writing a book written by something , something that &apos;s not going to happen , for example , that &apos;s not going to happen .
And it really happened .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s life .
So we &apos;re going to focus on the ideas of the world , which is to make it — it &apos;s more useful , it &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but the whole thing is that there &apos;s such a <unk> of our <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to <unk> a whole week of innovation , <unk> and <unk> , but you know why we need this innovation , and it &apos;s going to be exhausting and <unk> ?
Because half of the ideas that were crazy , and there was an opportunity to change the light , and we have an opportunity to change the world , which is what &apos;s happening there .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t <unk> , or not ? ( Laughter )
Where are my <unk> <unk> ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we go over here .
And it &apos;s going to be exhausting .
We took another idea .
We &apos;ve got another story .
We &apos;re going to get another scenario .
<unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ve already heard seven million times , is like a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , if you really want to be able to do this , you know , you &apos;re going to go beyond the limits of it , and you &apos;re going to be able to adjust to each other . &quot; &quot; And then we put it on a pedestal , and it &apos;s also <unk> , and the mystery of the Universe and the sound of the Universe and the answer to the Universe , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m going to panic . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> . ( Applause )
Five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
First of all , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And fortunately , these plans were by the British FBI .
But I &apos;m sorry to forgive you in the middle of the New York City department , not <unk> .
And the result of this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in the <unk> , and I was born with a <unk> , and I was born with a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
But when I got older than a year , I grew up in our family .
My father showed me that one of the things that I showed you is a little bit of an outsider to see , including most Muslims .
And what I &apos;ve been seeing is that when people give one one , they spend a lot of time to realize that there &apos;s a lot of time to understand that in the real way we want to think about what we want .
But in particular , every single one of the people , every single one of the people who have been exposed to the people who are so empowered , that they &apos;ve been able to use their ability to make a difference to make other people live on their own .
A few months later , the father of the father who had received me and told me that a few years later , he had a friend of his friends on Long Beach <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give it to him .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> .
On that day , my last year , I had a little <unk> in a small village called <unk> <unk> , and , in fact , there &apos;s an amazing thing to do , and that &apos;s especially the same for my year .
I got a friend of mine on my friends , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s a father , that &apos;s my son .
They &apos;re all very hard to do with it , but only a few years later , I realized that it &apos;s all about .
And they saw a little bit of the same thing that I had my father .
As a result of those people who had <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was a thousand percent more than a thousand .
These were men who I am .
<unk> people , I &apos;m going to <unk> , which means <unk> .
I &apos;m going to take a place for 20 minutes , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with my childhood , and that &apos;s what my childhood was doing .
Every time I entered the experience of myself in one room , an hour , an hour , an hour , a little bit of things that I had in a stranger .
I was always born in the classroom , and I was often a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get my job in a way that I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t have to worry about it , but as a kid , I &apos;m going to spend a child in the classroom .
It &apos;s going to play a game .
And I think that my social skills were inspired by saying , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not the best thing to do with it , but it &apos;s not the best part of life .
I was inspired by the people who were inspired by the <unk> <unk> , as the race or race .
What &apos;s going to tell me ?
The first of the subjects that we had this idea of thinking about this philosophical mindset was in the <unk> <unk> <unk> year .
And I was able to put a program in a way that I was able to put in front of a wall with a <unk> .
My group was violent .
Members of our groups are the most different layers of society .
One day , I &apos;m going to tell you that one of my new friends was a <unk> .
Because that &apos;s because this is a few days a few days ago , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
I had never had a friend of friends before , and I &apos;m thinking , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be able to make sure that I &apos;m going to be able to cover almost all my life .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> was a village in <unk> <unk> . It was a park .
And there &apos;s a lot of people growing up and cultures , and that experience is a fundamental fundamental thing in my mind .
That &apos;s not a good thing to do .
Now , as I got older , I had an opportunity to be able to be able to do that , and I quickly realized that many of them were going to be the same , and I quickly realized that many of them were going to be brave , and I quickly realized that many of them were going to be the same , and I quickly realized that many of them were going to be the same , and I quickly realized that many of them were going to be the same , and I quickly realized
<unk> <unk> , a kid in a kid who had a sense of shame for other people , and for me , I &apos;m going to get excited to other people &apos;s good people , so I would be able to make sure that I &apos;m going to go .
It &apos;s a sense of what I &apos;m going to do in my childhood , which is a kid in a kid who was a kid who was born .
I &apos;ve been wondering how it is to be a <unk> .
And then I was the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be able to deal with myself about my own behalf , and I asked me to realize that race is not a common thing to do with me , and to tell me that race is not a common thing to do with any individual personality .
Now , a lot of them have made me feel that I &apos;m going to be able to do that , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
And so often , you know , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of images where it &apos;s going to be wrong , right now , right now , I mean , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
One day , I was going to talk to my mother about how I started with my mother , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be the same thing I &apos;m going to do in my heart .
And so she looked at me , and she looked at me , and she looked at me , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do the people . &quot;
At that moment , I realized how much energy energy is going to be able to make sure that I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
Zack <unk> is not my name .
I &apos;m going to shake it when my family was , and I decided to do it with a whole life .
So let me tell you how many of you are going to be wondering , and I &apos;m going to give you a hug ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m going to do this in a way that someone else has a dream of a story to tell you that , instead of having a lot of money , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
Instead of using that experience , I was going to get my experience from the <unk> , and I had a <unk> .
I do this work for the <unk> and for their family , and I &apos;m going to do this for them , and they &apos;re exposed to some of the things that they &apos;ve done .
Now , memory has been a conversation that I &apos;m talking about , and that &apos;s what I do , and that &apos;s what my parents do .
I &apos;ve been a community that is not the case that the violence is not as an expert in a piece of a person or a race , and the son is not going to follow the path of my parents .
I wasn &apos;t my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you so much . ( Applause ) Thank you so much . ( Applause )
Or it can be a bit of a difference or a child .
It &apos;s not the best for the other .
I can help make a big difference in less choices than to do .
When I &apos;m going to make <unk> , I think , if I was an outsider .
So , when I was a kid , I was going to give you a little bit of my friends , and I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to be a fan of my life .
Now , I &apos;ve done a lot of people who have done a lot of them with all of them .
It &apos;s <unk> because it &apos;s not there .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , a little bit of a problem with a problem .
But you can &apos;t .
If you look at the good good , but it seems impractical .
On the family , and so forth .
<unk> , a career , a career that you can &apos;t afford to give you a little bit of money .
We have <unk> <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> , you &apos;re going to go on the street .
And you &apos;ve made a beeline for yourself .
It &apos;s going to make us <unk> .
I &apos;m the one who love the <unk> .
When we get into our own identity , if we &apos;re going to make a sense of ourselves .
You &apos;re going to be the most important thing .
A few years ago , I decided to go back to the path , and I decided to go back to the path , and then I decided to go out .
I &apos;m going to go through these <unk> <unk> .
Instead , it wasn &apos;t going to be published , and it was a lot more <unk> than a few months old .
So this picture of my grandfather , when I was doing it , every single day .
I &apos;m never going to be disappointed .
I &apos;m also going to panic .
In fact , the opposite of the <unk> — don &apos;t go to bed .
But it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> man . &quot;
I can &apos;t tell you , I can say , &quot; I &apos;m going to go . &quot;
And I realized that when I was doing this , I realized that when I was doing a change , they would be able to make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to do something called <unk> <unk> .
In fact , they &apos;re <unk> .
( Applause )
I was incredibly <unk> in the world , which is the world that &apos;s going to be a place in the world to be <unk> .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women were born on a pedestal .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , whether they had an empty spot , or a simple thing .
They ended up with <unk> <unk> , <unk> , 90 percent of women — and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , it &apos;s 90 percent .
It wasn &apos;t going to be working on that day because it doesn &apos;t work until women .
( Applause ) A few five years later , the Iranians had a chance to become the first ingredient in the world , which is the equivalent of the <unk> path of a woman in the world .
I will never forget that day when the president was born , and I was going to go back on the balcony of his house , and I went to the balcony of his house , and she &apos;s going to come back with her .
( Applause ) It became a <unk> <unk> for me and every person who was growing up in that hour , including <unk> .
It &apos;s often a little bit of a story about a friend who was going to come back and said , &quot; &quot; How can I be able to be a <unk> , if you &apos;re going to do it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s really no matter what the Higgs boson is , but even with a lot of the things that I &apos;m going to be like , even with a lot of money , it &apos;s not even with the same thing that I &apos;m going to be like , when I was
Who am I supposed to be ? &quot; &quot; Well , the women are less than the ones that are less than men .
<unk> in the United States in 2011 , in 2011 , 62 percent of the men of the men who are committed to <unk> <unk> , but only 45 percent of women .
We &apos;re going to see it in 16 percent , and that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to be wrong .
It &apos;s a real humanism , because I &apos;ve been wondering that the world needs a lot of the power and more legal leadership .
And so my solution is a solution to the notion that I &apos;m going to be able to do with my own <unk> , even without having an idea of what I &apos;m going to do , even without having any sense of what the meaning of the world is going to be able to have the meaning and the meaning for our kids , which is what the meaning of the world is going to be able to have the meaning of both of our children , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to
It was a trip of my life .
It was wonderful .
It came from 20 <unk> <unk> .
And then , after the rate of the rate of nine , we ended up talking to the <unk> , three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the drama of the drama .
<unk> , you know what the United Bang is , but I can tell — ( Laughter ) — I can tell you that and we &apos;re in the <unk> <unk> .
First of the last 20 years , the president of the last 20 years , the idea that it wasn &apos;t about <unk> , it was , perhaps , led to that .
And then he <unk> , and he <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was his family and his family .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because the president of the <unk> is going to be the <unk> .
And in a few days , a connection with his family and her family , and her family was also going to be the same , and he was also going to go back and forth .
Before that , he was wondering what it does , because there are two men who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it .
So 9 / 11 days , for 45 days , it &apos;s not very good for me .
I don &apos;t even have a place in the <unk> room .
I had one percent , and I was one percent , and it was one percent of the <unk> .
And what &apos;s going to tell me that I had to take all of them to get my place in order to get my place for the <unk> and get my place for the <unk> , because the <unk> decided that was only going to run between two and a half percent of the voice on the top .
On the day of these things , what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to be there with three women with three women , and I would argue that it &apos;s only about two and two percent in the day .
( Applause ) And it &apos;s a <unk> .
The problem with the problem , with which we have to get into this journey , was to be connected to the <unk> , and it &apos;s been connected to the same way .
It &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
Some of the things that the sex workers have is that the sex workers have been pushed for .
You can &apos;t panic .
I became able to get access to access , and I had an hour for the media .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s going to be done in a <unk> media , a couple of months in the media , in a few months before I was in front of the year .
And I don &apos;t want to argue that it &apos;s going to happen .
I mean , the reason for that is that the reason that the reason is in the media , because in the media , as a media , it &apos;s a legal and <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit shaky , and we &apos;re going to have to start thinking about that when we want to change .
If I had access to the TB , the first question is , &quot; &quot; Are you going to be able to do it ? &quot; &quot; That was the question of the question .
<unk> , from one to two to 2.5 percent of their voice to understand .
But the media really has a matter , and every time that I was with TB , we saw that we &apos;ve been seeing and felt in the wrong way , so I know how important it is , and why we need to focus on this .
And I had a little bit of <unk> , and I had never tried to interview the book .
And I was going to move beyond the question of the question that the rest of the rest of the world &apos;s self , and the other side of it .
I &apos;m going to get it to this , but I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to make a difference .
There were no more than any of my favorites or <unk> .
( Applause ) So this is going to be a <unk> .
But there &apos;s another very important experience .
I &apos;m going to be able to do a little bit of the <unk> , without the <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
So this kind of new experience and access to the resources , perhaps , is that we have a good idea of our own company , but also to make a difference .
Our company has been <unk> , and we , perhaps , changed the tone for others .
Mo is the reason that it &apos;s about TB , because I wanted to show you a little bit of the opposite .
If you have access to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to <unk> the information .
I &apos;m going to put on Facebook on Facebook , which is a little bit of a <unk> question .
All the questions together , and we &apos;re going to put on Facebook on Facebook , because we believed in the <unk> <unk> , when we had the <unk> <unk> .
And when I was born , I was going to be able to be able to use the attention of young young girls , and I started to use a camera .
I mean , I &apos;m going to make sure that I do , and I would argue that every single person I had ever seen as a couple of people who are going to make a difference .
I mean , I &apos;m really excited about a lot of <unk> and <unk> , because I &apos;m going to panic .
But because of that , we had the rate of the number of <unk> frauds .
You know , it &apos;s going to be a company and another way .
I &apos;m sorry to tell you , you know , you don &apos;t want to worry about money .
It &apos;s not that it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true , and we &apos;ve been less educated than other people .
<unk> , the reason is partly that , in my view , the time it was to come up with a piece of <unk> .
And maybe I &apos;m going to do a little bit more with a little bit of <unk> .
Some say that it &apos;s a very good thing .
But even with the media and the <unk> , and it &apos;s just the same thing , and it &apos;s just a good thing to do , but we &apos;ve got to work on the top of all the time .
I &apos;m going to shake myself myself as you can see on the <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> of the data , I was going to run a little bit of this .
( Laughter ) Well , too , too , I wasn &apos;t going to get a little wound , because I had a different place , and we were going to be able to put a little bit of the voices of the voice , and we were going to <unk> the <unk> , and it was about 10 percent of the <unk> in the back of the past .
Now , this is some sort of <unk> me <unk> , and a lot of people who have taken me over again .
But in fact , I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make a difference in a little bit of a <unk> <unk> , and a huge number of people that I &apos;ve done in 2040 , by 2040 .
( Applause ) Now she &apos;s 13 , and she never had any TB .
But in the afternoon , I was going to get bored with her in TB , and she was beaten up , and she was beaten up with her mother .
<unk> , that was the secret of my company .
( Applause ) But it was another one .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I had a <unk> , and I had a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
This is a picture for me .
We can do anything that is visible .
Yes , fear and problems .
( Applause ) Now , it takes time to change the needs , and it &apos;s time for the women , if it &apos;s going to be a <unk> person or a <unk> .
And I &apos;m also going to be able to get into the New Yorker called &quot; &quot; New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I got a new quote : &quot; &quot; The New Yorker &apos;s <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , this is my most ardent <unk> , because women are too often trained , because women are too often trained , and I know that we &apos;re just going to be wondering if we do it .
( Applause ) And we have to do more .
On the afternoon , we &apos;re going to <unk> , because we felt like this .
<unk> <unk> .
You have to go to that , and you , you , I &apos;m friends , and everyone who is going to work with you if you &apos;re a good job , and you &apos;re going to be able to stay out of it .
We &apos;re going to be good at the time , and I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to take a trip to this trip , more than I can tell you that I can tell you a little bit .
But it was a bit of a challenge .
And so I had a little crying of all of them .
It &apos;s not going to be exhausting , and it &apos;s not going to be done , and I realized that I knew that there was another day in the afternoon , and one of the things that was going on , you &apos;re just going to be in the way that you &apos;re going to get in a way when you &apos;re going to get the wrong voice .
It &apos;s like , you know , the good good news is , you know , you &apos;re wondering , you &apos;re going to make your own <unk> , but it &apos;s never going to kill you .
I &apos;m going to be able to do it , and you all know that any of you have the most important thing is your team .
People are both around the values of your values , but it &apos;s in the opposite .
For me , this is a definition of success , and I &apos;m going to be an amazing question that I &apos;m going to do today , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do tonight — ( Applause ) and we &apos;re going to be able to look at ourselves and we look at something like that , and we &apos;re going to make things like this .
To tell you , a little bit of a statement that I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s how I &apos;m going to make a decision that &apos;s going to be good when I was seven percent .
I put it on a point of view , because maybe he &apos;s going to be right , and he &apos;s going to be able to look at his view .
But one day at one point , I said , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
It &apos;s a very important thing to do that , because I &apos;m really afraid to sleep and I worked with people with me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to do a lot of it , if you look at ourselves .
I think it &apos;s a very important thing to do two things : you know , people who are willing to make you , but it &apos;s not less important than it is , but it &apos;s not less important than that , if you don &apos;t have any more than that , you have to be able to do that , including the <unk> .
I &apos;ve got all sorts of different things , and I &apos;m not going to be able to focus on the subject , partly because of my power , partly because of my power .
When I &apos;m going to move on to a moment , and this is an hour of the time , because it was an hour of the time , because it was a <unk> , and I &apos;m not just going to be able to do that , but in my mind .
I called our own company <unk> , which is called &quot; &quot; G , &quot; &quot; which means the word &quot; &quot; G means &quot; &quot; .
The first one of them is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to make a difference , I &apos;m going to be honest , and I wanted to encourage the leadership as well as a human job .
Another word is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or <unk> .
I thought I was going to do this .
You could take a lot of it , no matter what it was , and it was the case .
And I would argue that I &apos;m going to take care of it .
<unk> words , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was a <unk> for all the things .
I didn &apos;t have a clue , you know , on Facebook or our websites .
I mean , you know , you &apos;re going to ask the answers , you ask your answers to your questions .
It &apos;s less important to the most important words that you don &apos;t have to do in this room , and we &apos;re going to build a company called <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m really excited about that , and I &apos;ve found that we have found that they can &apos;t be able to make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to do it , but it &apos;s meant to be successful .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was simple , but I think it &apos;s a little bit of a story on May , and it was a <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat <unk> : I &apos;m not going to give you a little bit of you . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , I can &apos;t give you a little bit of it , not the <unk> .
I mean , maybe everybody in this room are ready to be able to be able to do that , and you &apos;re going to be able to do it .
We &apos;re not going to be able to have a voice for a voice , but there is something that we can take to be able to take in a sense of what we &apos;ve never seen before .
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s enough to remember that it &apos;s enough to remember the year after 1975 , as the women were born on the street , and it was really , really , really , as a result .
You &apos;re going to look at this <unk> before , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do that , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to do that , you know , a little bit of a <unk> that &apos;s going to be done in the <unk> .
And you can imagine , because the media is not going to be able to deal with that , but you can see that there are women coming back on the street . Right ?
TBP : Yeah . PM : Can we tell us about this ?
<unk> : 41 years from now , we can be able to mobilize the world in the world to be <unk> , but our work is <unk> .
And so , the <unk> , the women , the women who were going to have a job , because that hour after that time , they put their dues .
( Applause ) So what happened was that the <unk> and the young people who have been diagnosed with the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
PM : I &apos;m not going to ask you now , I &apos;m not going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be a big predictor of a <unk> , if you &apos;re going to do that again .
Thank you . <unk> .
CR : Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , I tried to try to think about my career , and I &apos;ve been trying to start thinking about my career , and the best example I &apos;m going to do is put in the New Yorker a couple years ago .
<unk> <unk> , you look at <unk> , he says , &quot; &quot; Dad , when I grow up , I want to be an ally . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to make a big difference , as I got to my country , because I had access to the people who had the world who had ever seen in the world .
I wasn &apos;t just about 50 percent in America , but we have my wife , and I &apos;m going to leave the world on the planet .
We &apos;re not just going to be able to do any of our <unk> or <unk> , but also the <unk> of the <unk> that we live in most of our lives .
It &apos;s an expert in human beings , and so forth , and so forth , as I know it , I can tell you , I can say no , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I can tell you that it &apos;s violence over women and zeros .
There &apos;s a few things that I &apos;m going to do .
<unk> for all , this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and so forth .
They put them together in order to claim that women are equal to the women who are used to say that women are equal to the majority of the men in the world .
Well , a few years ago , 2000 , I was an ally , and I was an outsider for 70 years ago , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been going to run in a high school every year , I &apos;m going to go back and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m going to be able to do it in 2000 , and I &apos;m going to be able to do that in 2000 .
So they &apos;re going to be the same way that they &apos;re concerned about , which means that the women are supposed to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the classroom , or the woman in the room in the classroom , and she can &apos;t be able to get into the classroom , because you can find them in the room , because you can find out that the woman is not going to be able to do that , but in a way that the woman doesn &apos;t need to be able to do
But it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be the case that we &apos;re going to be able to get men in a more walkable way .
It &apos;s a problem , because men can be threatened by the power , for example , and when the husband or women are willing to be willing to ask women who are more likely to be able to do that .
So why should I be able to pay it for a good job for a good job ?
The problem with this problem is to be able to get worse .
The United States , for example , we had a <unk> increase in <unk> <unk> , and the people who were going to be buried in <unk> .
One of the more than 1,000 Americans have been in <unk> .
Today , we have more than a thousand <unk> .
It &apos;s an increased increase .
From the time I left the house , there was an increase in 800 percent of women in the hospital .
We &apos;re one of the <unk> <unk> on Earth , and I had a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to be one of the things that we &apos;re going to have in one of the contexts that we &apos;ve been doing .
So we &apos;re now in California , and I &apos;m going to go on the other day , and I was going to go on the other day that I had four dollars on a <unk> .
There &apos;s a man on a <unk> .
A few weeks ago , the law of the British law , which is the <unk> law , which is the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the people who are in the same way that women are among women &apos;s rights .
I &apos;m going to be pretty good .
They &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> .
But in a few countries , in many countries , there &apos;s a few countries born in her life , and they &apos;re going to live in her life , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of it , and it &apos;s going to be the same thing that &apos;s made by the same thing that &apos;s made of a <unk> .
<unk> , more <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And then she &apos;s married to marry , and you could have sex with sex .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , and it &apos;s the law .
<unk> , for example , 91 in all the women that live today , and they &apos;ve been trained in this way .
In a few countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of women who are willing to do that .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for all women who live in countries .
The other thing is , it &apos;s a little bit of a piece of a piece — and there &apos;s nothing in the wrong thing that I &apos;m talking about , and it &apos;s not going to be the same thing that &apos;s going to do with her family , and when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s married or she would marry or even when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s going to marry or even when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s going to marry or even when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s going to marry
It &apos;s going to be done by a family of their family , and that &apos;s when I become a girl with a girl in a family .
It was not so long to look at the <unk> , and it showed that 75 percent of these young women were <unk> <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , 25 percent of the women &apos;s women .
The fundamental problem that we have in the world in common to women is slavery , whether it &apos;s slavery .
About half a million people were born in the dark light in the world , and in 18 cents .
30 million people live today in slavery today .
The United States of the United States , my grandparents &apos; worth of <unk> every year , 80 percent of all the women in the world who are 80 percent of the women who are affected by slavery .
In the United States , it &apos;s in this moment , 60,000 people are living under violent or slavery .
Atlanta , the <unk> , where we &apos;re going to be able to get into the <unk> , between 200 and 300 women , people and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people , people , people and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people , people and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people and 300 women
It &apos;s a room for one of this .
There are lots and lots and lots of <unk> .
And if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be able to do that by a thousand dollars , which is why they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , Wyoming .
So that &apos;s another thing that &apos;s going to be a good problem because there &apos;s no way that you &apos;re going to have in America , but it &apos;s not a good thing to do in America .
It &apos;s the same thing to do with the <unk> , the women of the women , the women of the world .
<unk> my good approach to this .
For 20 or 15 years ago , we decided to change the law , and women are more concerned about the law when they were born in violent slavery , but by the way , they &apos;re going to go on a decline in slavery .
The United States .
On the one hand , there was 25 women in the United States .
Canada , <unk> , I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> and other countries &apos; s right now .
It &apos;s a different one on the right you can be done .
We have two big holes in our pockets , and we &apos;re going to be able to create a system .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which I got , says that there was a <unk> in a <unk> .
Only 3,000 , more than one hump , and the reason is that it &apos;s going to be the case that we have any organization , as a <unk> , or the <unk> in the <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> of my law , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the past , that they want to be able to do that , they don &apos;t do it .
This law has to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to have a lot of <unk> , partly from my book , and in addition to the other things , because of the other things , it &apos;s due to 89 percent of my book , but because of other things , it &apos;s due to 89 <unk> in America to protect them from domestic violence .
<unk> <unk> says , on the top of the 19th century , so far that you can see if they put their hands on their own , but when they put them on the board .
They don &apos;t touch .
These things are the things that are going on in our minds .
It &apos;s a very good thing to be like , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , you don &apos;t know . ( Applause ) And this is a little bit of a bit of a <unk> .
When I became an outsider , it was 39 <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> , and so forth — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 hours in the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening now .
If you take 500 of them , you &apos;re 23 of them , and it &apos;s about 500 years old , and it &apos;s going to be one of the other things that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
It &apos;s what &apos;s going on in our <unk> .
The other problem with <unk> <unk> : we are the most <unk> <unk> on Earth .
We &apos;re going to stay in war in World War II .
<unk> our grandparents &apos; pockets .
<unk> together , we &apos;re going to <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> bombs .
<unk> , of course , we have a <unk> .
We &apos;ve been in war with 25 different things , and we were going to have another World War II .
For years of age , I &apos;m not going to say that we &apos;re not going to <unk> — ( Applause ) — we &apos;re not going to do the bombs of bombs , we &apos;re not going to panic .
But in any case , the things that are going to be wrong with the violence and the oppressed of the holy scriptures , the principles of law violence .
The other one is the reason , the <unk> , the men &apos;s men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
The guy who might say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; is very similar to what I was like to be small when I was born .
<unk> <unk> , the end of the war , the World War II , the World War II , which is when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But for this time , there were lots of white people who didn &apos;t believe that they had the <unk> , but they &apos;re not supposed to be because they &apos;re not supposed to be able to do that , because they &apos;re going to be the same thing that &apos;s happening today , because it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s happening today , because it &apos;s the same thing that we have today , because it &apos;s not a good thing .
Even when they say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re using .
The vast majority of men who have specialized reproductive systems , the majority of the men who are going to invest in the world , most of the men who are going to be humiliated in the world , and most of the men who are going to be very good .
Is it a good thing to do today ?
I would like to say , the best thing that we could do for women with this idea , and how do you think about it , and where you &apos;re going to be wondering , and then you &apos;re going to be wondering , and that &apos;s what I need to have to do with all of these things to be more inclined to end up in the world .
I don &apos;t know what to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what to tell me what to tell a woman to tell me what to tell me what to tell a woman to tell me what to tell me what to tell a woman to tell me what to tell me what to tell a woman to tell me what to tell me what to tell a woman to tell me what to tell me what to tell a woman to tell me what to tell me what to tell a woman in a
But I hope that after this scenario , women are focused on learning , on college campuses , college campuses , and in the future , and in the future , we need to protect our own <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;ve got 12 minutes to spend my kids , and I often think about them , and that &apos;s not only when they &apos;re going to live in order to be a good thing , and I hope that all of you are going to be willing to be brave for women around the world , and we protect them right now .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
And when I was in front of the Senate , the future of the world seemed to be <unk> .
<unk> growth was not going to stop .
<unk> <unk> was a <unk> .
The cancer of cancer , the <unk> <unk> in the background , was going to be the beginning of our life .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> would be <unk> .
It didn &apos;t come out . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) So , that &apos;s not that <unk> per capita per capita , on average , on the other side of the person in the middle of the year .
And I had a <unk> life for 30 percent .
<unk> <unk> on two thirds .
<unk> per capita is growing up on the <unk> .
And the only <unk> that has been more tolerant to be able to figure out how to do it ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> shows per capita .
To answer that question , you have to learn how to think about how we &apos;re going to be able to understand , and you should be able to understand how to make their own sense of <unk> and <unk> .
In other words , you have to understand how the ideas have sex .
I want you to imagine what we were going to be able to write on how we were going to be able to do something about it .
Over 30,000 generations .
<unk> , it was a few changes , but the CDC &apos;s app for a while .
It &apos;s a <unk> phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
And that hour after the last five years .
And it &apos;s not going to be helpful .
It &apos;s going to be a little bit of different <unk> , and it &apos;s not going to be the same .
And more than that , with all sorts of different ideas — ideas of cooperation , ideas of laser , ideas .
They &apos;ve been pushed together in this technology .
And that &apos;s what it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s not a solution to me , because I think that &apos;s the key to realizing what &apos;s happening in the world .
The body of the body is also the <unk> ideas : the idea of the <unk> , the idea of the brain , the idea of the <unk> of the brain , the idea of <unk> <unk> .
They go together .
How do you think of something that &apos;s going to make a difference ?
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
In the middle of the species , if you look at two different kinds of things in different contexts .
One of the things that we need to do is another one of the things .
In the same way , there &apos;s a lot of people who have a chance to get into the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So this is the same thing that &apos;s going to allow the individuals to give rise to the whole species .
It &apos;s not a good friend of a <unk> .
Now , the question of this is that &apos;s going to be the case of the Cultural Revolution , which is my dream of a <unk> ?
And I think the answer is , it &apos;s a little bit of a piece of stuff on a different way .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> doesn &apos;t do that .
Culture can no longer be .
Maybe it might be a <unk> culture .
<unk> has a culture .
They are taught one of the things that were going on their parents &apos; parents .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s in the same way .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
So why do you think about the fetal genome ?
The answer is , the answer to the last few years .
I think it &apos;s a 21st-century version of the 20th century that he was also going to be able to get into the <unk> between the <unk> .
Adam <unk> <unk> for four hours and three hours .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends
Oz is the best for Adam and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> Adam <unk> .
He can do his own <unk> and <unk> .
If the Oz of two <unk> and Adam <unk> are two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> .
It makes sense for the <unk> , and so forth .
Adam and Oz , you know .
You know , as long as long as long as you &apos;re going to work , you should be able to work , and that &apos;s what I want to do , and that &apos;s what the book is .
If you &apos;re going to take a little bit of it , you &apos;re going to have to run out .
How much is it ? It &apos;s a lot of time .
How many are you going to work on an hour for an hour for an hour , if you &apos;re going to have a <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to drop out of the 10 seconds of your car compared to 1950 .
You &apos;re going to be 15 minutes to give you a little bit of money on average , on average .
You &apos;ve got to work six hours , so you &apos;ve got to work six hours , so you &apos;ve got to work for an hour .
So let &apos;s go back to the <unk> and the question of the question , &quot; Who did them for whom ? &quot;
The <unk> on the right on the right was made for me .
How do you do it ?
<unk> ? <unk> ?
You know , I think millions .
To make sure that I &apos;m going to make a beeline for me .
And it &apos;s a society .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
<unk> clock , if you were lucky , people literally worked on you .
They were going to be able to do it , and they made it wrong . ( Laughter ) And they did the same thing , and they did the same thing , and they did it in the same way .
<unk> people with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , and it &apos;s also <unk> , and it &apos;s also <unk> .
They &apos;re in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re going to give you a little bit of food in the hour after the <unk> , the quality of which you &apos;re going to have to do in an hour after a mammogram , the quality of which is going to be a <unk> , the quality of which is going to be the same .
They &apos;re going to maximize the standards of each other .
In fact , there are other things that work with one .
<unk> is an example .
<unk> is <unk> .
Even though we don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) So , if the behavior started ?
It &apos;s a great deal of work .
But I don &apos;t have that .
There &apos;s a great job for food .
<unk> men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> knows .
And the guy knows that he doesn &apos;t need to be able to make a difference .
And everything that you need to do is , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t going to be done .
They were high with <unk> <unk> .
They were very smart .
But there is no idea that they had a good job for them .
There &apos;s no way that you &apos;re talking about .
The women who are connected together with men .
And there &apos;s no way that we &apos;re talking about , and that &apos;s not what you &apos;re talking about , because there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , the tools that they &apos;ve done , the tools that they would be born with .
For example , there &apos;s a place where there was a place where you &apos;ve been able to adjust the device to the <unk> .
They &apos;re always born with <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s a new kind of world that &apos;s going to be the same for modern people in the world , and I think we &apos;re going to be able to do that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
When the person started to celebrate , this is a reminder of what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of thousands of years ago in Africa , where we see that we &apos;re going to be able to see that we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
<unk> — as we got in front of it , he was going to take 200 kilometers of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what people started to do .
And that &apos;s led to the <unk> .
They put them together in a way that they &apos;re going to do with these kinds of things like <unk> , and in some way , there &apos;s some kind of <unk> .
What happens when you look at the people from the <unk> , from the ability to heal and <unk> ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not just a good thing to do , but I can even get it into the <unk> .
It &apos;s a kind of thing to do .
They &apos;re going to be exposed to people who are dying from the people who have been diagnosed .
It wasn &apos;t enough because the population in 4,000 people were not adequate enough to support the skills they need .
It wasn &apos;t at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s in fact that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Well , it was <unk> .
So let &apos;s go back to the rest of it , and it &apos;s not just who did it for a person , but who knew how to do that ?
No , literally no one .
There &apos;s a person on the side of the barn .
I mean , I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; which he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you how to do it , because people don &apos;t know how to do it , because people don &apos;t know how to do it , because they don &apos;t know how to do it .
And what we &apos;ve done in the midst of <unk> , the path of <unk> and <unk> — we created the opportunity to do things that we don &apos;t even know .
It &apos;s not what &apos;s in the language .
But at the beginning of the technology , the technology of the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the
In fact , I &apos;m not going to be able to focus on a professional class class , or to give you a lot of IQ groups than other groups .
It &apos;s not my fault .
There &apos;s a matter of making sure that the good people have their ideas , and how good they are , not how common one person is .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> brain .
We &apos;re just going to be a <unk> .
We are the neurons of this brain .
<unk> ideas , <unk> ideas , and one of the things that is one of them is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , step back .
It &apos;s not less than that , and it &apos;s not very specific .
Now , the future we &apos;re going to do , we &apos;re going to make things wrong .
<unk> war , depression , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> things in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also convinced that the things that are the good things that people have , the ability of the ideas and the things that I &apos;ve never seen before , I &apos;m also convinced that technology is going to be wrong .
Because , in a way , through the <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that , but you know , if you &apos;re going to go through it , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to do it , but it &apos;s not a very good idea .
Thank you .
