( Arab ) I &apos;m going to go in a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , and the name of the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
I was born in a family of a <unk> .
The <unk> was five years old , when the baby was born , and when I was born , I was born .
The Victorians didn &apos;t have a <unk> , and they were not the same as the <unk> , they needed to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was lucky .
My mother was 16 , my mother was 16 .
And it &apos;s about 16 children only five <unk> .
Imagine that the checklisted childhood was .
I &apos;m going to be interested in women who are going to be paid for the women who are going to be paid for the kids who are going to be able to get the same .
When I was a senior school , I was going to run a school , and I would like to run a school , and if I was a kid , I was going to get a job of a school , and if I was a kid , I was going to get a job of a school , and if I was a kid , I was going to get a job of a school , and if I was a kid , I was going to get a job of a school , and if I
I wanted to be a <unk> to help the women and to help them .
So I &apos;m going to go to school .
I wasn &apos;t a <unk> for the <unk> , so I was a little bit of a <unk> , and I couldn &apos;t get it .
And my father had to be in a hurry .
I &apos;m going to go in a hurry .
I &apos;ve been making my education .
Now , while I was a <unk> , I &apos;m going to have a <unk> <unk> .
You know , when I was a college student , I had no idea what I was with , and I had no idea what I was with .
I was going to go months , and I had no idea .
My family was in a room for a <unk> .
As soon as I was working for a school , I was born in a <unk> .
I wanted them to live in a <unk> .
So , was my heart ?
The heart of the heart was in a <unk> .
If you look at what &apos;s happening in my mind , my heart is a <unk> .
I was very keen to return to my own <unk> , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that , but I had no idea what I could do .
I was good at work .
<unk> are in the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> .
When I was going to be able to do this , I saw a few million pounds of <unk> , and a half million <unk> .
About 90 percent of them were women and children , and most of them were beaten up or <unk> , and the majority were being rejected or the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to make things that I &apos;m going to do , and I &apos;m going to make things that you can &apos;t imagine .
I saw a little bit of a kid with a four-year-old who was crying and crying , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a woman who couldn &apos;t get to the room to go , didn &apos;t work , but it wasn &apos;t even a place for a career .
I saw the <unk> that was going to take their parents and their homes , and they were the ones that were going to be published , and they were the family of the family .
It was very exciting .
And we talk about the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to ask myself , &quot; &quot; What can I do for these people ? &quot; &quot;
How can I help them ?
I realized that education was changing my life .
It changed me , I was going to make me status .
I realized that I had to give the people to the public education and the health , and I started working on this .
I mean , I was easy to guess ?
Not because at that moment , education is completely <unk> .
And because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the
The guy was going to be a <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Who am I like this ?
Do I have a chance ? It &apos;s not .
That &apos;s why I had to be able to get the idea of the community to be able to do this .
How did I go to this ?
I &apos;m going to be a <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to panic .
The <unk> was 80 .
It was a <unk> .
I was in his head with a <unk> in his head .
He looks at me and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> . How can I be a <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get you . &quot; &quot; And when I started to get his story , the news was , the news was going to be a <unk> .
We have 25 schools in one year , and 15,000 children who are in the schools are <unk> . It &apos;s amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
The good thing we work , we &apos;re working with a good thing , and we &apos;re going to be right in the right women , right , the person &apos;s right , the person , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
One day I was in an office in a <unk> , <unk> .
Suddenly , I saw my own <unk> , and I would have a door to the door and I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; When is you wondering what you do ?
You &apos;re going to be <unk> . You know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , you know , you &apos;re going to have your life on your life .
But as a coward , you should be a <unk> .
You have to be able to get the strength and the strength of the strength .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the thing ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s happening ? &quot; &quot;
So I &apos;m going to be able to do it .
They &apos;re <unk> . <unk> .
( Laughter ) A great man , people , who are , ( Laughter ) — is a great deal of people , and people , who are very good , very good people , ( Laughter ) — a great deal of people , people , who are , ( Laughter ) — a great deal of people , who are , ( Laughter ) — a great deal of people , who are , really , very good people , ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s a great deal of people , and people , who are
I put them in the <unk> and I &apos;m going to get the <unk> .
They said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , the <unk> will not be .
<unk> , their voice , the voice that they talk to me , really , I &apos;m really excited . I &apos;m really excited .
But I was a <unk> , a <unk> .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ?
What you &apos;re going to do is you &apos;re going to get a look at them ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them , and I just looked at them , and they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be a <unk> .
So we were going to give some students together , and we were doing some students .
And the Koran says that if you &apos;re a conservative Koran , a woman &apos;s worth of a woman &apos;s job , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go on the wrong end of the day . ( Laughter ) And they started to speak at the same time , and they started to speak . ( Laughter )
And I &apos;m going to get a little bit of a trip to the last time , and they started to go and started .
I was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> students , and we &apos;re going to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
I started with the mother and children .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve all been able to do all the things that you can imagine .
I was a <unk> . I was a <unk> job .
One day , four <unk> , one of the <unk> , and I was going to be on the <unk> of Kabul , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With the <unk> , they will be able to do it .
I said to the translator , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the thing that &apos;s happening ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s happening ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I can answer it .
What should you ?
We all have all of these <unk> <unk> .
And yet , the moment is that we should be able to be strong .
You &apos;re going to be a <unk> .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
And it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> and a <unk> .
I went and they said , &quot; &quot; We will give you the car . &quot; &quot; I went to the car , and I sat down in the car , and I sat down in the car , and I sat down and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll give you the car . &quot; &quot; I went to my car and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll give you the car . &quot; &quot; I went to my car and they said , &quot; &quot; We will give you the car . &quot; &quot; I
I want to get them to school , and I don &apos;t have any other .
All of the things that are left . No one is not a <unk> .
I was just a little bit of a voice , and I lost a voice .
and he said , &quot; &quot; What should you do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
They &apos;re going to be hundreds of hundred hundred women to get a lot of education .
So I &apos;m going to get a bit of a bit of a sudden — at this moment , we &apos;re going to get the wrong thing — that one of the most important things that I had ever seen is a little bit of a <unk> .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make it .
She said , &quot; &quot; Is it not you . What happened to the wrong ?
But it wasn &apos;t or not to me , but it wasn &apos;t going to be a good thing .
You &apos;re going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re going to be able to do that , because they &apos;re going to go forward and forth .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said that I was going to give them a little bit of a piece of it .
Today , these are the best of the people that are the best ones .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s a focus on what the people will change .
If you &apos;re going to take people , you &apos;re going to be a human , if you &apos;re going to be a human , you &apos;re going to get people .
( Laughter ) But the other thing that we have to do is , the other people , the other women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women , the women
I bet that I am .
I live in a <unk> , which was a <unk> and a coward .
I &apos;m going to just share with you .
It was a beautiful <unk> , and it was a beautiful <unk> , and it was a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk> , a beautiful <unk>
We could go out where we wanted .
You know what happened to my boss ?
Now , people can &apos;t walk to home , not to be able to walk away .
But we want to go back to our <unk> .
They get a little bit of <unk> and they &apos;re going to get on the floor .
So the light is going to see that you can see that if you look at the same thing that &apos;s going to be a good thing .
I &apos;m going to share this with you that I &apos;m going to share with you this .
And what I said is that compassion and the Higgs boson , that &apos;s the ultimate universe .
<unk> : What &apos;s the <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> , let &apos;s say .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to ask you , please , you know , you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a <unk> , and a <unk> , a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ?
We have a <unk> <unk> data .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I quickly got a little bit of a demonstration .
( Applause ) My brother , I &apos;m going to go with a couple of weeks , like a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a kid in a <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to argue who is that there is a great deal .
So , in the midst of a <unk> program , a <unk> program that most people don &apos;t know .
When I realized that the <unk> is the ones that do the things I do , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be a bit of a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be a bit of a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I was saying that , or , it was a big advocate for my life .
The <unk> and the art of the art and the great ones were always the <unk> <unk> .
But the idea of the <unk> technology , the idea of creating a <unk> idea of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , I was a <unk> , and I was going to get rid of it , and I got to get it to my hand , and I had a thought , what if there was a small world in the middle of the computer ?
Maybe there &apos;s a kind of thing that &apos;s going to be a <unk> , where they &apos;re going to be able to do that ?
So the first thing called the <unk> <unk> .
When I was a year old , the first time I showed up , I showed you how to put a computer on the pieces and the painting that I had .
So I had a whole book of a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be a golfer with a self in a <unk> language , and I &apos;m going to give you a speech with a <unk> and a <unk> .
I also have a new idea of what I call &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other people are going to be the same as the ones that are in the same way that they &apos;re going to be .
If the flowers don &apos;t take any of these things , they &apos;re all kind of <unk> that they &apos;re going to be able to do with plants , we &apos;re going to be able to be with a <unk> .
So I decided to use these kinds of <unk> and they do the same thing .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) SM : <unk> ! Who &apos;s going to get it .
We have to be a <unk> <unk> .
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All my mind have been different from ideas , but what &apos;s the ideas ?
The amygdala is capable of making a spectroscope .
<unk> is a new and new kind of thing .
Because the light is really the most powerful thing to do .
If not ideas , we would not be there , and we would not be able to be a <unk> or a <unk> , not a art , and we don &apos;t have art , culture , our lifestyles .
When I was eight years old , I was going to put my ideas and I was using the book of <unk> , and I was a foundation of the foundation of the planet .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to make a difference in the form of separation and the printer .
I &apos;m now 13 , and I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and my career has been a very early career .
So the big thing that I &apos;m always interested in is the art of art , and I wanted to put it in the whole thing that I do , and I was going to make it a little bit of my own .
The <unk> <unk> of the cloth in the house , I thought , &quot; &quot; I can do that , I can do it , I can &apos;t do it , I could have a lot of <unk> <unk> .
I said , if I had my own self , I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a lie on the street , and I &apos;m going to be on the street with a question of the question , &quot; How do you get a <unk> ? &quot;
I thought , and I thought , well , it &apos;s going to be done by the end of the world .
Because I was only eight years old , and I wasn &apos;t there in the career of the career .
I had just had the idea that I wanted to be able to get a little bit of a <unk> , and that I wanted to share with the end of the person who I was in my life .
My mother &apos;s <unk> , and I was going to go on the couch and I snuck on my head and I snuck on my head with my head and I snuck in my head and I would be able to make it for every single end of my production .
I started to create more <unk> , like the <unk> and the <unk> .
My <unk> started to be born around the world , and I had a year of <unk> , <unk> , Australia , Australia and other countries .
Well , I had to have a lot of learning about the notion of the <unk> , as , for example , the <unk> and the way to the relationship with the relationship and the things that are more likely to be better or worse .
The teacher was going to be a <unk> .
And one time I was 10 years old , I was with the Forbes friend of Forbes friend .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me and I was in his own business .
Who &apos;s going to be wondering , why have my own <unk> ?
I &apos;ve been a very strong student , and I &apos;m going to get excited about it , and I believe in that in life .
My parents wound up being a bit of a sudden , the most less <unk> , and the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be able to do this , or even the process of making things dangerous for people and the planet , and I started to build my research and I realized that even after the wrong , there &apos;s a problem for the question that I should be with .
And with the <unk> process , the <unk> process , or the <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s all that air is made by the air , and it &apos;s just the whole of the most important air that it is .
Because when I started with a puzzle , I had a little bit of fun things : all my own dreams have to be a little bit of a <unk> , and that &apos;s about 20 percent of my life , and I should be able to do this .
( Applause ) I think that &apos;s part of the new new new <unk> that I don &apos;t want to make money , but also the other side of the world .
I believe that I could be able to make my own <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a lot of the <unk> of the generations of the future .
We live in a <unk> , <unk> and peace world , and I &apos;m going to be more inclined to protect it .
What &apos;s happening in the world alone , and the idea is not enough .
And I should have to go on a heart , because this is the case of the idea of the <unk> .
It &apos;s also a very strong thing to look at the world , so that &apos;s what the ideas of the world are going to be .
Thank you , all the things that are broken and the labels .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : You heard the lessons from the parents who were going to be able to do this for all of these women who were going to be doing this for all of these women . Where are they ?
Please , you know , you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a <unk> , you can ...
( Applause )
Here &apos;s a few <unk> about the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be the same as they &apos;re going to be the <unk> <unk> , which is connected to each other .
Most of the things you see on the screen is not the stars , but the stars , or the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to give you some of these things , I think , that you &apos;re going to be wondering that you &apos;re going to be quick , that &apos;s not just a bit of a deal with the wrong thing , but more than that , I think , that &apos;s not just a bit of a deal , but it &apos;s not just a bit of a deal , I think , that &apos;s the way that they &apos;re going to be .
The source of the Universe is the source of the Universe of the Universe .
And in my own history , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
I think there are four principles of <unk> , and the first one that is a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
So how much does this ?
So , that &apos;s a good thing to do with one thing that &apos;s called the <unk> .
It &apos;s so powerful that the light that &apos;s going to turn through it is a little bit of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a light that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
And when you really look at it , you can see the <unk> around the world &apos;s side of the <unk> .
To be able to do that , it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s more than one of the most important things that I &apos;ve seen in a way of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a powerful thing to be able to be these systems .
But more than that , they have a <unk> .
They &apos;re essentially integrated , and when you &apos;re going to be able to think about them as a human being , the Universe &apos;s known to the Universe .
And so many things that can be more important than we have , the idea of the universe , like , how do you work ?
You can answer the information that we &apos;ll be able to answer to the whole system .
So this is what we said about the <unk> .
Second , these things are very common .
So if you take a <unk> , you can see the light of the <unk> , and the light that &apos;s going to be the most mysterious , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And what we see here is actually a light light .
So the question of the question is , if it wasn &apos;t a little bit of a light that &apos;s going to be like this ?
And the heat is going to be frozen , gas from a <unk> , a gas station , it &apos;s a <unk> .
And the reason that you can see that they can find a little bit on the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of these things , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
So this is a fundamental meaning , but it &apos;s just a little bit of a <unk> .
Now , the other thing that we have to do is also , many other things that we &apos;ve seen as much as a new , and yet we had our own understanding of the physics of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a very good thing .
To tell you about this , I have to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to tell you about a very specific fact .
Most of the Universe are not going to be done with the same thing .
You &apos;re going to have a little bit of a shot .
Most of the most pressing things that we call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is something that &apos;s not very good about , except for the weight of the <unk> , and the good news is that we can get more about it .
If you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re wondering what happens when we put something to each other .
And the <unk> is not the case of the <unk> .
So how can we do that ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to answer that I &apos;m going to answer a little bit more , &quot; What will be when the <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> on the <unk> .
We &apos;ve been wondering that we have a very good species of the Universe that we &apos;ve just made of a computer .
They &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s what you see in this case .
<unk> is a gas , and you can see a lot of the stuff .
What &apos;s happening here is a very , very powerful thing to be a very , very mysterious way .
And that &apos;s really important , because it means that it &apos;s very , very mysterious , very powerful , that it &apos;s hard to get into the lab , and it can be a bit of a sense of what we can see in the lab .
So that &apos;s very , very exciting .
The question is , the question of the question is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , the question of the question , &quot; &quot; which is the essence of the moral imperative , the reason why the question is , the ability to focus on the moral issue , is that they can teach us about the moral truth , which is what they &apos;re like to do .
<unk> is a very good thing .
The night I had really touched my head .
If there &apos;s a more bizarre thing , it should be a lack of energy .
When I put a balloon balloon , I would argue that he was a <unk> balloon .
But I &apos;m not suggesting that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be more unstable .
So the way that we do that , the way that we think the Universe is going to be .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s going to be a bit more unstable .
They &apos;re going to be able to put this <unk> <unk> name and call it a <unk> .
And we have to look at this very quickly .
So the question that is a common question that is a single question of the universe , which is the ability to be able to make the energy of the universe to be able to make a difference ?
And using it , it &apos;s disconnected , it can make your own body more or more or less .
And the problem of the Universe in the midst of the Universe is that the one is the most mysterious .
<unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
We need to get it to the <unk> .
I love to think of it as I was using it , by using a <unk> .
To explain how to understand the <unk> , the most important thing is that it &apos;s not a model of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
The biggest thing is that you can look at the <unk> <unk> .
So I can learn a lot about the Universe that the Universe had , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the pieces of it , the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you a TED Talk , but you can feel a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
And so what I did was , what I started with , how much I was going to do with the idea of the <unk> , and the question that I &apos;ve been doing with this is , how do they actually use ?
Well , for the answer , I &apos;m a <unk> Ford , and I asked him to ask for a second .
So this is what he said , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;m going to be a person in the people that you need to do , they said that they need to be the ultimate <unk> of our society with a very large <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t get wet .
They ask the number of <unk> <unk> .
So we need to go , so we need to be a <unk> , but we also need to remember innovation , <unk> , <unk> , this stuff that we have in the way that we &apos;re going to take our field of <unk> , when we do step back , we get a little bit .
And I think the best way to do this is to look around us . Thank you .
( Applause )
So imagine you &apos;re going to be on the street in the United States and you &apos;re going to get a little bit of the Japanese and says , &quot; &quot; <unk> , how is this block of this block ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the thing that &apos;s called this block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t have a call .
The name of the name ; the <unk> is just a <unk> between the <unk> . &quot; &quot; He goes , you know , a little bit of a <unk> .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and you &apos;re going to have a little bit of yourself on the street , and you &apos;re going to be in a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be able to have a person with a <unk> and a <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> , how is this ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is the block of the block , and this is the block of 16 . &quot; &quot; And you answer , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the thing that &apos;s called this ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ll say that the <unk> of the Greek is called .
There &apos;s a name .
Here &apos;s a Google Map , and this is a block of 14 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 19 .
In all of these things , there &apos;s names , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; names . &quot; &quot; <unk> is just a <unk> between the <unk> .
And you answer , &quot; &quot; Okay , well , well , how do you know your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; The message says , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s simple , this is a <unk> .
There &apos;s a block of a block , a house of one , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; But the way that I noticed in the neighborhood is that ladies are not yet . &quot; &quot; The Iranians said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the labels are , the way that the story is , the <unk> depends on the next , when ladies were a <unk> .
The house that was taken in the first place , is the house that was a common room for the first time .
The house that was a <unk> house , a room for two .
The house is a room for three . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s a little bit of fun . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m very happy that we have to have a little bit of a look at the second side of the ground to understand something , and we don &apos;t even get to understand that something else &apos;s going to be wrong .
Here &apos;s the example , there &apos;s a great deal of the evidence that they &apos;re going to do , that &apos;s the social health .
So every month , if you don &apos;t get wet , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a bit of money , and if you don &apos;t get paid , you don &apos;t have to pay it , because they don &apos;t have a job to do it , because they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
( Applause ) Almost all the same <unk> , the <unk> is a <unk> , a <unk> sentence , one , two four .
But the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
You can hear it &apos;s not just in the <unk> , but also , as they think of it as a <unk> , three , four , time .
And this is also a <unk> .
( Laughter ) And I think in every single one , in every single one , that &apos;s the story that is also a <unk> , which is also a <unk> .
So let &apos;s not be surprised what you &apos;re at TED , or the other thing that &apos;s going to be like , whether it &apos;s a good idea that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> , it can also be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
