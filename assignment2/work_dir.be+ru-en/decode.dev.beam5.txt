( Arab ) I &apos;m going to go to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
I was born in my family and I was born .
<unk> was five years old , when the baby was born .
It wasn &apos;t the <unk> <unk> , because they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was lucky .
My mother had 16 children .
It &apos;s about 16 children just five <unk> .
Imagine what my childhood was in .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be interested in women who are going to make sure that they &apos;re going to be paid , or the kids who are going to be able to make a difference .
When I was going to school , if I was going to school .
I wanted to be an outsider to help the women and the kids .
So I &apos;m going to go to school .
I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do that , so I wasn &apos;t going to go to the <unk> , so I was going to put it in trouble , but I couldn &apos;t do it .
And my father took me in a hoodie .
I &apos;m going to go in a hurry .
I got my education .
Now , while I &apos;m going to panic , I &apos;m going to have a <unk> <unk> .
You know , I had no idea what my family was , and I had no idea what I was with .
<unk> months , and I had no idea .
My family , I was in my family .
As soon as I got to school , I was born in a <unk> .
And I wanted them to live in a <unk> .
Where was my heart ?
The nervous heart was in <unk> .
If you look at what &apos;s happening in my mind , my heart is a <unk> .
I was very keen to return to my alma mater , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do it .
I had a good job .
<unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to get a little bit of this .
When I was going to be able to do something about it , I saw a few million pounds of <unk> , and a half million <unk> .
About 90 percent of them were women and children , and the majority were <unk> or <unk> , and the majority of them were <unk> .
When I &apos;m going to make a little bit of things that you can &apos;t imagine .
I was seeing a couple of kids who were crying and crying , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I was seeing a woman who wasn &apos;t going to be able to go back , didn &apos;t have the education that was not even a place for life .
I saw the <unk> that was going to take their parents and their homes and their homes , and they were born .
It was very exciting .
At that moment , we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; What can I do for these people ? &quot; &quot;
How can I help you ?
I realized that education changed my life .
It changed me with the status quo .
At that moment , I realized that I had to be able to support the public education and the health , and I started working on this .
Did I guess what was easy ?
It &apos;s not because at that moment , education is all about <unk> .
It &apos;s because the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s because the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> was a <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Who am I like this ?
Do I do that ? I &apos;m not .
So this is why I had to be able to do this in this room .
So how did I do that ?
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> .
It was 80 years old .
It was <unk> .
I &apos;m going to put it in front of him .
And he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get rid of you . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get rid of you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And when I started with him , the news was , the news started .
We have 25 schools in one year , and 15,000 children who are in the schools are <unk> . It &apos;s amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
We &apos;re working , we &apos;re working , we &apos;re working , we &apos;re going to be the wrong person , right , the person &apos;s right , the man , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
One day I was sitting in an office in an office .
Suddenly , I &apos;ve been able to see that I &apos;m going to be able to have a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; When is you wondering what you do ?
You &apos;re <unk> . You know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , you know , you &apos;re going to have your life .
But you have to be <unk> .
You have to get the strength and the strength .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s happening ?
Because I &apos;m going to get them wrong .
They &apos;re <unk> . <unk> .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s remarkable people .
I put them together and I &apos;m going to <unk> them .
They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not going to be bad .
<unk> , their voice , the voice that they talk to me , and I &apos;m really excited .
But I was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ?
What are you going to do ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them , and I just looked at them , and I &apos;m just looking at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be a <unk> here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to do this . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to do that . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> .
Yes , we had some students .
And the Koran says that if you &apos;re a young woman , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re not going to be able to do it . ( Laughter )
And in that moment , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of fun of it , and that &apos;s how they opened up .
( Laughter ) I was a <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s three students who are <unk> . We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother and children .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to <unk> all the things that you can imagine .
I was an ally . I &apos;m going to make my job .
One day , four <unk> , one <unk> , and I was going to go on the back of the Kabul , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to be able to do that with <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s happening ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s happening ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can answer it .
What should you ?
We all have all of these <unk> <unk> .
And yet , at the moment , if you &apos;re going to be strong .
<unk> , wherever you are .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
At birth , it &apos;s a little bit of <unk> and <unk> .
I went and they said to me , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to go . &quot; &quot; I went to the car , and I sat down in the car , sat down .
I want to put them in school , whatever else .
All right . No , no .
I was just a little bit of a voice , and I lost a voice .
I thought , &quot; &quot; What should you do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
They have hundreds of hundred million women in order to get education .
Now , I &apos;m going to be able to shake and blow up â€” at this moment , we &apos;re going to focus on this one moment , and one of the things that I had in this moment is one of my favorites of <unk> .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; I said , Sakena ?
She said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not you . What happened ?
But no , no , no , no .
You &apos;re going to do it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m not going to be able to do it .
I said , &quot; &quot; I told you that I &apos;m going to give them a little bit .
Today , these are the people who are the best ones .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s about what education is going to change people .
If you &apos;re going to take people , you &apos;re going to get people .

and I bet that ...
I live in a <unk> , which was a <unk> and <unk> .
I want to just share with you .
It was a beautiful <unk> .
We could go where we wanted .
You know what happened to me ?
Today , people can &apos;t walk away from the house , don &apos;t worry about it .
But we want to go back to our <unk> .
They &apos;re going to get a little bit of <unk> .
So you can see , you see , you see , you know , you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
I &apos;m going to share this with you that I &apos;m going to share with you this .
He said that the compassion and the Higgs boson .
<unk> : What &apos;s going on ?
<unk> : <unk> , let &apos;s go .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
TBP : I &apos;m going to ask you , please , you know , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ?
We &apos;ve got some <unk> <unk> data .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to take a little bit of you .
( Applause ) My brother , I &apos;m going to go with a couple of weeks , like a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go on the street with three years old .
Well , I &apos;m going to argue who I am .
In fact , there &apos;s a <unk> program that most people don &apos;t know .
And when I realized that I wasn &apos;t going to be the ones that do the things I do , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be ashamed ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; or , it was a big deal of my life .
<unk> and art , we &apos;ve always been a <unk> <unk> .
But the idea of the <unk> technology , the idea of creating <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So my computer was an outsider , and I tried to get rid of it , and then I thought , what if there was a small world in the middle of the world ?
Could they be there , where are they going to be willing to go ?
So the New Yorker was born .
When I was a half years old , I showed you how to put a computer on the pieces and I handed it to him .
So I had a whole book of <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be a golfer , and now I &apos;m going to give you the language of <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m also going to make a new <unk> , which is called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about the bees and the other things that we have , and why are we going to get them .
If the flowers don &apos;t take any of these things , you know , all the things that are going to go out of the plants , we &apos;re going to <unk> , we would be able to eat .
And so I decided to use these conversations with them , and they &apos;re going to do with them .
( Applause ) ( Beatboxing ) ( Beatboxing ) ( Beatboxing ) ( Beatboxing ) ( Coughs ) <unk> !
We have to make <unk> <unk> !
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
<unk> can be inspired .
<unk> is a bold and new skill .
It &apos;s really the light of the world &apos;s light .
If not ideas , we would not be there , if you &apos;re going to be there , if you &apos;re going to be there , you wouldn &apos;t be compassionate or culture , and we don &apos;t have art , culture , our lifestyles .
When I was eight years old , I had my ideas , and I was going to get my ideas and I was called the <unk> Foundation , which is a foundation for the planet .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to make a difference in the form of separation , and I &apos;m going to go .
I &apos;m now 13 , and I &apos;m just 13 , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do that with my career , and I have a lot of growth in my career .
And so far , it &apos;s always a little bit of art , and I wanted to make sure that I &apos;m going to do that , I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to do this .
The <unk> <unk> of the cloth in the house , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with that , you know , maybe I had a lot of <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to argue that when I was going on my head , I &apos;m going to stand up on the street with a question , &quot; &quot; How is it going to be ? &quot;
I thought , and I thought , well , it &apos;s going to be done , and it &apos;s discovered .
Because I was only eight years old , and I wasn &apos;t .
I had just had the idea that I wanted to be able to make sure that I wasn &apos;t afraid that I would tell you that I had to share some of the things that I had in my life .
And my mother took me a little bit , and I sat on the couch and I snuck in on my head and I snuck in my head and I snuck in my head and I was going to be able to do it for all of my time .
I &apos;m going to be able to do more things like this , and I &apos;m going to be able to do that , and I &apos;m going to do it .
So I &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> started around the world , and I &apos;ve got a year from the <unk> , <unk> , Australia , Australia and other countries .
Well , I had to have a lot of learning to learn about how , as , for example , for example , for example , as , for example , as well as I do , as I do , as we do , as we can &apos;t do it , it &apos;s better or worse .
<unk> <unk> started .
And one time I was 10 years old , with me with the Forbes friend of Forbes .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me , and I &apos;m going to write about it .
Who &apos;s going to ask me , why do I think I am a cardiologist ?
Since I &apos;m going to take a lot of money , I don &apos;t know what we live in .
I love the wound that the wound of my parents had to do with the end of the person , who is less and less , and the <unk> , and the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to get a piece of cloth , or even the process of making things that are dangerous for the people and the planet , and I started my research and I realized that , even after that , there &apos;s a problem to be able to get into what they &apos;re going to do with .
It &apos;s a <unk> process , and it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s sort of a <unk> air , and it &apos;s all the way that it works for all of the things that they have .
And so when I started with a <unk> , I knew that all of my dreams have had to be done , and that &apos;s about 20 percent of my life , and that &apos;s about 20 percent of my life .
( Applause ) I think that &apos;s a part of the new new design that I don &apos;t just want to make money , but also the <unk> of the world .
I believe that I could be able to make sure that I could take a lot of people who are going to have a better life to live a lot of life .
We live in a <unk> , <unk> and peace world , and I &apos;m going to be more inclined to protect it .
And what &apos;s happening in the world is just in the world and I &apos;m not enough .
It &apos;s all about the heart , because that &apos;s why the idea of this is a <unk> idea .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to be true , and it &apos;s going to look at the world &apos;s ideas .
( Applause ) Thank you , everyone &apos;s going to go .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : You know , my parents told me how I read about their parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; family . Where are they ?
Please , you know , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> , you can ...
( Applause )
Here &apos;s a couple of things that we &apos;ve done .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;ve been inspired by the <unk> <unk> , which is connected to each other .
Most of the things that you see on the screen is not a distant star , but the stars , or the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you some of these things , and I &apos;m going to argue that you &apos;re going to be quick , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , that it &apos;s not just about <unk> , but more than that , I think it &apos;s not just about the wrong thing , but more than that , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
<unk> is the source of the observable Universe .
And in his own history , the message that you have to do is , you know , the notion that you can get over there .
I think there are four main principles of <unk> , and the first type of thing that &apos;s going to be done is in the <unk> <unk> .
So , how do you know ?
Okay , so it &apos;s a little bit of a friend of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s so fascinating that the light that &apos;s going to turn through it is that the light that &apos;s going to take away from that , it &apos;s called <unk> .
And when you really look at it very quickly , you can see that you can see the <unk> around .
You don &apos;t have to be able to deal with this thing , and that &apos;s more than one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is how miniaturization can be this system .
But more than that , they &apos;ve got <unk> .
They &apos;re essentially integrated , and when you look at it , we can think of them as a representative version of the Universe .
And a lot of things that are going to be going to be going to have to change the universe , for example , how do we work ?
You can answer that gene system .
So that &apos;s what we said about the <unk> .
Second , these things are kind of the same thing .
So , if you take a look at it , you know , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of the light that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going to be the same thing that &apos;s going to take away from that big , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
So what we see here is actually a light light .
So the final question is , if it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , what &apos;s going on ?
And it &apos;s going to be frozen gas , gas , gas <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
And you can see that you can find a little bit on the <unk> .
And what we &apos;ve got to do is that you can see that they &apos;re going to be able to adjust the weight of the gas , and you can see that it &apos;s a little bit of a piece of gas , and you can see that it &apos;s a <unk> .
So this is the essence of the meaning , but it &apos;s just a <unk> .
There &apos;s also a lot of other other things that we &apos;ve seen as much as possible for us , and before we get to our own understanding of the physics of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> .
To tell you , I have to tell you about this , I &apos;m going to tell you about the truth .
Most of the Universe , most of the Universe are not going to be done .
You &apos;re going to be born .
Most of the things that we call <unk> <unk> is what we call <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is something that &apos;s not very good about it , except for the weight of the <unk> , and the good news is , we &apos;ve got to know more about it .
If you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you wonder what happens when we put something to each other .
And it &apos;s not an ally , it &apos;s not an ally .
So how can we do that ?
To answer that question , I &apos;m going to answer something different : &quot; What will we be when ? &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to argue that we &apos;re going to be able to look at these kinds of strands of the Universe , just by the core of the versions .
They &apos;re going to take a little bit of <unk> , and that &apos;s what you can see in this case .
<unk> is a gas station , and you can see a lot of <unk> .
And what &apos;s happening here is that it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s really important , because it means that it &apos;s very , very mysterious , very powerful , that it &apos;s hard to be able to get into the lab , and we can see something that we can see in the lab .
So that &apos;s very , very exciting .
Now , what &apos;s wrong about this is that we can teach ourselves about what we are about to say , what is the essence of the moral philosopher , the reason why we think about the moral boson , the reason that we think about the wrong thing , is that they are so unpredictable .
It &apos;s a simple thing : physics is very good .
It was actually the beginning of my head .
If there &apos;s a little more bizarre , it &apos;s going to have to be a dark energy .
When I put the ball in the air , I would argue that he was a <unk> balloon .
But I &apos;m not suggesting that it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do with it , and it &apos;s going to be more unstable .
So what &apos;s going to be done by the way that the universe works .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s going to take all the way down .
They put it in the name of this <unk> <unk> name , and the name of it is energy .
Now , we &apos;ve got to understand more about this .
So the question is , the question is , what is the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be able to make a difference in the universe ?
Now , using it , the structure of your body , the structure of your body , is more or less .
And the problem of the Universe in the midst of the Universe is that it &apos;s not that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got to make it <unk> .
I love to think of that , by the way .
To tell you , as a <unk> , the most important thing is that it &apos;s not a model that is not a model for each other &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s an important thing to look at the <unk> <unk> .
So , I can learn a lot about the Universe that we &apos;ve seen the Universe in the <unk> <unk> , and these are the pieces of it , and these pieces are called <unk> .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to give my TED Talk , but you can feel a little bit of it .
Now , what I &apos;m going to do is , what I started with , how do I think about it , is that I &apos;m going to ask a few more things , but how do they actually use it ?
Well , for the answer to me , I &apos;m going to give a British Ford , when he asked me to ask my story .
So this is what he said , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;m going to go to the people that you need , they said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what we need to do with the <unk> of our society with a very large <unk> .
And it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t touch the <unk> .
They &apos;re asking the numbers of <unk> <unk> .
So we need to go , so we need to be honest , but we also need to remember the innovation , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the things that are going to look at when we &apos;re going to step back , and when we do step back .
And I think the best way to do this is to look around us . Thank you .
( Applause )
So you imagine that you &apos;re going to be on the street in America , and you &apos;re going to be a Japanese and says , &quot; &quot; <unk> , what &apos;s called this block ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Well , this is a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s good about this block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; You know , what &apos;s good about this block ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t have a call .
The name of the names of the names ; the <unk> is just the <unk> between the <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of <unk> and <unk> .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at in the street , and you &apos;re going to look at the street in the street , you know , you &apos;re going to look at the street and you &apos;re going , &quot; &quot; <unk> , what &apos;s called the <unk> ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is the block block , and this is the block of 16 . &quot; &quot; And you can answer , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s good about this ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s tell you , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to be like this ?
There &apos;s a name .
Here &apos;s Google Maps . This is a block of 14 , 15 , 16 , eight , 19 .
In all of these things , there &apos;s a name of the name ; it &apos;s just a little bit of a <unk> between the <unk> .
And you can answer , &quot; &quot; Okay , well , well , how do you know your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s simple , this is a <unk> .
There &apos;s a block of a block that &apos;s left , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; But I noticed that in the neighborhood , I noticed that ladies don &apos;t .
The house that was sent to the first stage , which is the house for the first one .
The house that was <unk> , the house was two .
<unk> home is the house of three . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s a <unk> .
So here &apos;s the kind of example , there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do .
So every month , if you don &apos;t get wet , you &apos;re going to be <unk> , and if you don &apos;t smoke , you don &apos;t want to pay it , because they &apos;re not going to be paid with their job , because they &apos;re not going to be helpful .
( Applause ) Almost almost every single one of the <unk> is a <unk> , a common proposition . One , two four .
But what &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , the <unk> <unk> .
You can hear it &apos;s not just in the <unk> , but as they think about it , two , four , four , time .
And this is also a <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , I think in particular , in every single one that comes out of the race , there is a superpower , which is also a <unk> .
So , let &apos;s not tell you what you &apos;re at TED , or it &apos;s something else that &apos;s going to be a good idea for you , and it &apos;s not that you can imagine it can be done .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
