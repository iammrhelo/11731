( <unk> ) <unk> on <unk> , <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> in a family class .
My mother was five years when he <unk> their father , but when I <unk> , he was a man .
If their children were children or girls : they &apos;re going to go to school .
So I think I was <unk> .
My mother was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re getting five .
You can imagine what I had to do when was a child .
<unk> , at the end of the <unk> <unk> , or kids being <unk> to a <unk> .
At that moment , when a high school , I wanted to be <unk> .
I want to be a <unk> to help women and kids .
So I took my education , but I &apos;m going to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in my country , there was no <unk> for women on the <unk> so that , I know I was going to be <unk> in medicine .
As a result , my father was <unk> .
So I went to America for America .
I <unk> my studies .
Whereas my education , I grew up my country .
You know , when I was my <unk> <unk> , which was my <unk> <unk> , which was my family , and my country .
<unk> months , and I &apos;m not bad news .
My family <unk> in a field of <unk> .
And so instead of the studies , my <unk> family in America .
I want to remember that they are .
But where I was my heart ?
My <unk> was in Afghanistan .
We all the days , when I <unk> the bad news , when I was <unk> in my country , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go back back to my country , but , at the same time , I knew that I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
They live to live with them .
So , and everything was happy .
I was <unk> to my head .
So we took the field of <unk> .
And when I arrived at the field of <unk> , there was seven million and a half of <unk> , and a half of <unk> .
<unk> , at the 90 percent were women and children .
And he was doing that <unk> <unk> , <unk> with things that wouldn &apos;t get .
And I went to a <unk> with a five minutes , a children , there was a <unk> , without why do .
And I took a woman that I didn &apos;t have to go , without any <unk> , and they didn &apos;t have a place in which live .
And I had a student who had their parents , their <unk> , and they were talking about 10 years old , they had the head of family and try to protect their own own , their kids , and children .
The one was absolutely <unk> .
My <unk> , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So at that moment , I got a single one .
So that moment , I mean , I can &apos;t do why these people ?
How can we do ?
I &apos;m a person , I can do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew I knew my life .
<unk> . We got a position .
<unk> trust . It &apos;s <unk> a career .
I &apos;m going to show you that my family , my family , my family in another country , for the other country .
And at that moment I knew what happened to my people was education and health and that was what they will get .
But they think that was easy ?
Well , we didn &apos;t , because the women didn &apos;t have access to the education .
In addition , after the <unk> Institute in Afghanistan , people have no <unk> .
It was very hard to say , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Who is me ?
Think of the United States .
Whereas if you go here .
<unk> on me ? Of course I don &apos;t .
And so what was actually to do was to trust each of this community .
How do I do that ?
I went on , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;m going to ask you .
In the end , I found a man .
He had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
And I went to his head on the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; I want to <unk> on a professor . &quot;
And he <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I think I can be a professor ? &quot; &quot; And I <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> of you , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> my <unk> , <unk> the voice .
Instead of a year , we had 25 schools , 15 kids , 15 kids going to school , and he was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
And of course , we were doing our job , to do our job , <unk> , <unk> in <unk> of the women , human beings , democracy .
And one day , I was in the office in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And , of course , I saw that all my personal <unk> was the <unk> and <unk> the doors , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , you might be asking , what does ?
You have fear . You know that it &apos;s dangerous .
You know that your life is on the game .
But as you think , you have to maintain the <unk> .
You have to keep the <unk> and show you .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And these <unk> <unk> on my office .
So the <unk> of the office .
<unk> . These were nine .
Those were the richest men they can see .
( Laughter ) <unk> with a <unk> , black black , black , <unk> , and put on <unk> in my office .
And I &apos;m going to show you to me and did a tea .
We were <unk> . They don &apos;t get irony .
And of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I was really <unk> .
But , at the same time , <unk> .
And of course , at that moment , you might see how to see it , <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And the only one thing if I was looking at the eyes .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; What do ? &quot;
&quot; We don &apos;t know that the school <unk> <unk> ?
&quot; &quot; What do we do ? &quot; &quot; And , you know , <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; What school ? &quot; &quot; What in school , where he is to school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And he <unk> to the face and said , &quot; &quot; This is my house . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And he came to me , &quot; &quot; This is my house . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I looked at my home and said , &quot; &quot;
You have some students . We all call the Koran , the book .
You know , the Koran says that if you were the <unk> book , you can be good <unk> , and you can put your own <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to be a thing : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to be a thing : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to show you a thing : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to show you a thing : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to show you a
They <unk> each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they know , and they know , and they should be <unk> .
So my personal personal <unk> , my office .
They were <unk> from fear .
They don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t know .
They don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t want to do with them .
However , all they were <unk> from this .
Very <unk> and , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) And of course , I was <unk> .
But , it also , the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> of <unk> , when the <unk> had the power was another story .
<unk> in the <unk> , and we took the 80 to 80 , three <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of the <unk> , we have a country and <unk> a school after another .
I &apos;m going to show you a lot of time to women .
They were <unk> without <unk> without .
We work with women and children .
<unk> about health <unk> .
So how many types of <unk> and you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was going to be with my job in my job .
And one day , when I grew up with four , and with a <unk> , <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and a more <unk> , <unk> in the road , the <unk> <unk> .
With it back to me , <unk> the road .
I was <unk> to my driver that he was <unk> , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; It said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think you see with you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I can <unk> .
What do you ? &quot; &quot; They said that anything , and they do .
At that moment , the women <unk> inside the car .
I &apos;m very <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; This is the end .
This time , <unk> to everyone .
I had no doubt .
But yet , when the point is , at the point of all the people and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
<unk> on your <unk> and you can see that .
So I &apos;m going to focus on a car .
My <unk> , and I went from the car .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What I can <unk> ? &quot; &quot; You know what I knew ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know that &apos;s .
We know where it &apos;s going .
<unk> all the days of a place .
<unk> women , <unk> , <unk> , and they also have found the chance to have a job .
<unk> . What about it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
What we go to do ? &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; Is it .
So we know , the only one we can do , for time in what we can live , is <unk> a weapon .
We don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And you know what means .
And it was a <unk> .
And he <unk> , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let me give you , &quot; &quot; I do &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; And I walked in the car , I sat on the car , I sat down to the <unk> . &quot;
We just had money to give them to them on them , for them to school , and even more .
When I go to office , obviously all the <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> their own .
My <unk> was the only one I was there , and I &apos;m going to be wrong .
I was <unk> , my wife , and I said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m going to be wondering ? &quot;
Because we have <unk> education in the northern .
Hundreds of women who were <unk> from the <unk> .
So he was there , and , and , we &apos;re now , now , we &apos;re here talking about all , because , at that moment , one of my <unk> , <unk> a girl .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I sat on .
He said , &quot; &quot; You are , &quot; &quot; You are you . What about you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Great . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
It was the same thing that I was <unk> , I couldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; .
&quot; &quot; Okay , tell you what &apos;s happening .
<unk> all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Well , for the next , you go and <unk> them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when , two days after , I did the same way , they know what ?
So I got the car .
<unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; Is it well , &quot; &quot; Is me with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Is you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Is you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know .
So the last <unk> , and to <unk> , they were <unk> , they were <unk> teachers .
Now they are the best teachers .
They have English , trying to be teachers , trying to be teachers and are my <unk> .
We all the <unk> areas that we don &apos;t know , on the mountain , they come up with me . They &apos;re going to go and go .
And they <unk> .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That means that the education education .
When I <unk> people , they &apos;re all the people , and they change , we need to work that .
You can &apos;t get the women and <unk> of men , because men are the people who <unk> them into the top .
( Laughter ) So that we start to <unk> , because you have to be the potential to <unk> , because that causes the potential <unk> and that those women can change the same .
So let &apos;s take men and I think I &apos;m working on .
I live alive in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful country , and he <unk> .
It <unk> all the parts .
The women <unk> education : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — And they were a home to another .
You don &apos;t know the doors .
But I know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t go out , you can go to go up .
But we still want to Afghanistan .
And I want to talk to another part .
Now , the women are very hard , very hard .
<unk> . They have <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> to be <unk> , again .
They need to be <unk> and <unk> .
So it &apos;s great to see how people do all do all the potential all the potential and all of this .
I want to show you with you by the love , because compassion , through trust , and I hope .
If you have these things , you can see .
We have a poet <unk> , <unk> .
He said that if if it has compassion and if it has love , you can see the world .
And we <unk> , we could have .
And if we were able to Afghanistan , I &apos;m giving up to 100 percent , which can be in the world .
Thank you , many , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
There are 10 years ago I got a <unk> that changed my life .
So , I was <unk> in the <unk> of the University of <unk> , Los Angeles .
That was a <unk> of the Los Angeles of Los Angeles .
A few years ago with <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that he was a <unk> disorder .
<unk> if I could go back to be a <unk> <unk> , but we want to go back to get an possible .
We <unk> that the <unk> of the United States , they &apos;re talking with <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of the same patients .
But sometimes , <unk> to the medical community , especially for some medical medical records , especially for some medical records , but at the medical community .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the case of this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> that the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and doctors in the <unk> that we took his heart .
And that process , we have to <unk> in a lot of patients , it was <unk> , with the exception of that <unk> and glue .
<unk> symptoms , and they &apos;re trying to symptoms of my patients , and they &apos;re trying to remember , for their patients .
And in time , in the same day , he was going to send up the Center of <unk> and in Los Angeles .
And I started to see clearly a thing .
So , doctors , doctors , doctors and <unk> the same way of their patients in their patients , and animals , <unk> <unk> <unk> , of the brain , <unk> , diabetes , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk>
Well , I have a <unk> .
But when I &apos;m going through <unk> <unk> and biology for my <unk> — my <unk> , my <unk> <unk> , even my <unk> <unk> — to learn more than the <unk> <unk> — to learn and human beings , and human was a <unk> of attention .
And I started <unk> as I could be , with all those <unk> <unk> , that never never had to be a <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> to have another perspective on one of my patients ?
You have never to have a conference ?
Even more , why should be <unk> ?
And all the doctors has a different connections between animals and human beings .
We all know the drugs that we have to do or that we take , that we give them to our small families before .
But there is a great difference between the one of a drug or a drug or <unk> a human disease , and that animal is <unk> by themselves .
If it &apos;s part of the age of the <unk> , the world does between the <unk> and the not <unk> .
I &apos;m talking about these children , they think they think the <unk> <unk> in the trees , or that the <unk> of one .
The individuals in today , we have to transform every day , to transform every time in <unk> of technology .
And that creates a app where the patients are going to be <unk> , and the patients are living in the ocean , in <unk> and <unk> .
But I think there &apos;s still a larger reason .
At the doctors and the scientists are <unk> that our species , the <unk> , is just a more <unk> , and more more than any other .
But in our brain , we don &apos;t just just just <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you the same thing when I was Mozart , or I watch my <unk> , never did the <unk> .
Well , I think that &apos;s called a human <unk> , even the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a kind of fire , at the part .
Well , but this is <unk> .
Now , when I see the one part of the human , I always asked me , what the doctors of animals , and I don &apos;t know ?
So , I could have to make a better <unk> of my <unk> , but it : I could have to make better better , the <unk> as a human <unk> ?
And I &apos;m going to have a few examples of the <unk> and I &apos;m going to call this kind of <unk> .
It was <unk> by fear .
At the year , the <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
It was <unk> in a song of a game that <unk> the savings rate of all the lives in a <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> in front of the <unk> .
But it turns out that this is , &quot; &quot; Well , the human , and it was the <unk> .
The <unk> has <unk> <unk> , and even <unk> symptoms , <unk> <unk> in animals , from <unk> <unk> , from <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , from the 1950s .
How many lives , if a human lives , they could have been if that knowledge of the knowledge of <unk> and <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some patients we have to do themselves .
<unk> that <unk> .
Some patients are also if they can <unk> themselves .
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and again .
But the <unk> of these are very <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and even prevent the <unk> in the animals that they were <unk> so .
You don &apos;t want to be that knowledge of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the patients are <unk> with <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
For the little , for a little bit of <unk> , some women <unk> on the depression , by the time for depression , and still still <unk> .
You can <unk> their own son , and in <unk> , they &apos;ll get to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> know they also know that when he was <unk> , little after <unk> , can <unk> their <unk> , and in some cases , and in some cases , <unk> up to <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> with a treatment to address this syndrome from the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is the hormone <unk> , and that is that the <unk> is a <unk> in your <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to be this information to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , of the doctors and the patients that if they will be <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
The fact that &apos;s all of the <unk> that is all this , the gap between our body is that big .
For <unk> , so I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m going to have to put some of some evidence .
There are doctors who can be <unk> <unk> with the <unk> that they don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
I mean , <unk> , <unk> and psychologists , but especially the <unk> .
And of course , the biggest part of the doctors isn &apos;t the idea that it &apos;s more hard to get today in a <unk> than in a medical <unk> than a medical than one of today , and that when we go to learn about the health and the diseases of mammals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , fish and birds .
So you don &apos;t know the <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> of my friend <unk> .
So here is a lot of the part of the <unk> : How is that you call the one <unk> that you can know a species ?
<unk> this gap in my pocket , and I &apos;m going to learn through <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> in the <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of our records , and the <unk> <unk> of our records , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of our arms in the <unk> of our <unk> .
And through the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> on the disease and the disorders of patients and animals .
And in the <unk> , we decided to do how the treatment of the treatment of <unk> in a <unk> , you can try to improve the better <unk> of a <unk> in a <unk> of education , and how the understanding of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; and the best <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and how the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; and the best <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and how the understanding of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> , first in America , first in America , and now <unk> <unk> their <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> as doctors , as the doctors , as doctors as doctors , as doctors as doctors .
In fact , humans , humans , we are also animals , and it &apos;s also time for us , and it &apos;s time for us , and in the <unk> of a <unk> , and in the <unk> of the health <unk> <unk> to the health <unk> .
Because it turns out that some of the best and more <unk> , are being <unk> by the doctors that have patients are patients that are patients .
And one of the best hand , the <unk> of the human patient is actually <unk> a lot of attention , and one of the other patients in the planet , and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It is that , right ?
( Laughter ) So here is , &quot; &quot; was . &quot; &quot; <unk> ! !
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> that was , as you can imagine , and ( Applause )
I didn &apos;t know anything about the <unk> .
In contrast , when you have <unk> .
The life , the one of a human being , is <unk> by the data doctors : the <unk> <unk> , the U.K.
So , I was <unk> in a disease .
The doctors start to speak a <unk> that you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to show you with your finger your hand , and your <unk> .
People starts to change also because they &apos;re trying to do with Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What you said , &quot; &quot; What is the doctor ? &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to show you questions for the one that you have to answer .
<unk> of the guy , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to work with <unk> ?
I &apos;m trying to study ? Can do the love ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What I was doing this ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can change something in my lifestyle , &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; You can change something in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; There are something that can do ?
There are some other option ? &quot; &quot; And , of course , the doctors are all sorts of all these cases , because they are very <unk> and <unk> with <unk> .
But they also are very likely to do with patients with patients , so I would say that the time I would say that the <unk> of the perspective that you might say , literally , in a patient .
( Laughter ) The things are <unk> , but the one thing is that you &apos;ve been <unk> of any way in the <unk> , in your situation , in order to <unk> your family and friends in some way that you &apos;re looking at .
But with all , I &apos;m going to show you to see in the hands of a series of <unk> very <unk> .
Whereas he was in the hospital , I told me that I &apos;m going to show you my <unk> <unk> .
It was very hard to do , because it &apos;s not very powerful , a picture of your own .
I said , &quot; &quot; All right , and I said , &quot; &quot; All right , you have no <unk> .
And I &apos;m more than this .
A cure , which is , they &apos;re going to go to everything my being . &quot; &quot; So I looked at the day of the hospital , the medical record .
He was going to change my relationship to the <unk> , and he was going to learn more about him before to do something as <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> , use a different types of technologies and information in my job .
So my great <unk> was <unk> , all the information , and to do that kind of way that we could be able to do it .
So I went to a website called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And actually I had to <unk> , but that &apos;s why we can talk to talk .
( Laughter ) <unk> that word , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; because he <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and because of course , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and because of course , the word &quot; &quot; You can have a lot of <unk> .
In our culture , it means by our culture means to do it to the disease , but in other different as example of Africa as the Mediterranean , of the Mediterranean , and the <unk> of Africa or Africa can eat many other things .
And of course I &apos;ve been interested in the doctors and the rest of the health <unk> health , but also feel me on the <unk> , by the <unk> , by the <unk> , or why you don &apos;t know the musicians .
<unk> social <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And it worked .
The place , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; the world .
I &apos;m going to show you a lot of attention , and the most of <unk> people have <unk> with me on a very short time through <unk> , but many more people as <unk> as a person , but many more were about how much person &apos;s like .
For example , I &apos;m going to show out out , images , pictures , pictures and <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
We have here the example of <unk> and his <unk> .
Or what he did the <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> in my garage , and he <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
Now you can also have to get my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think about it , we can share the same <unk> .
And that was what I was going to do : Well , traditional <unk> medicine , all of the doctors , all they are familiar with me to <unk> .
And we took all this information and wisdom , and I went to who a team of biological team , doctors , <unk> and hundreds of hundreds of <unk> that I could talk about the information , which is really important .
<unk> , we had to take a strategy of my own <unk> in different different , and <unk> through different cultures .
So the potential to <unk> the world and thousands of years of human history , that I have been quite amazing .
<unk> .
So I could give my time to go .
So the doctor I wanted to work , she was going to work on the hospital that I wanted to be , and everything I wanted to be , and I wanted to be , and all those thousands of people were <unk> without feel me .
All the world I could have to be <unk> <unk> , and this is the most important part of <unk> <unk> .
What was the results ?
I &apos;m well , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) <unk> news after — I have — wow — I was — I had a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t have much .
It &apos;s not my life , and my lifestyle &apos;s life .
And it was very amazing , I was a <unk> network , I had a <unk> <unk> to my brain in this side side , to build a medical <unk> of what the brain works .
And just before the app , we were able to look at this class of the doctor , we could have been able to understand the risks that he was going to move .
<unk> , <unk> .
This <unk> was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of people put their stories , their stories .
The doctors started talking to people who are not <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s me to me , I am in a state of translation between many different languages , where the science is involved with you and the <unk> with traditional <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The second <unk> <unk> was <unk> part of a truly society , and they start on its well-being of the one of their individuals .
This is my <unk> <unk> open to the <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have no idea what we &apos;re playing .
I &apos;m not going to tell you what it is until you <unk> .
I wasn &apos;t supposed to be able to be something about music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I &apos;m listening to do .
( Applause ) All right , before , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the stage , ( Applause ) <unk> <unk> in the <unk> — ( Applause ) <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> , how we call it , is a space .
It &apos;s a place .
And one of the things that they do is that we don &apos;t think of it is that not us the chance to think in the future , or in the past .
So you &apos;re alive at this moment .
There are a lot of choices when one is going to be <unk> .
We don &apos;t have no idea what they were playing .
So , we did a <unk> of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; But that might happen or not .
You all know , we all <unk> . We <unk> .
There is no time for our ideas .
So , the idea of a mistake , from the perspective of a musician , is more to talk about the mistake that person .
The way of <unk> a mistake when I &apos;m in <unk> — before nothing we see as a mistake .
The only mistake <unk> in which they &apos;re not who who did .
Every monkey , &quot; &quot; is a chance .
It &apos;s hard to describe what it would would be a fun of it .
For example , if you look at a color , like <unk> , like <unk> with <unk> , we could <unk> like this .
( Applause ) If Sandrine , a piece , like <unk> . ( Applause )
You see , all <unk> in your colors .
If they go back .
You see , all <unk> in the inside of this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , if you look at it , let &apos;s give you a little bit of you just a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , we &apos;re going to do a point .
And we &apos;re going to show in this <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> <unk> this picture .
And we don &apos;t get to start that .
I &apos;m going to show up for a second , and then I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop .
Let &apos;s see that &apos;s what happens when we <unk> with this <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> , someone could be <unk> as a mistake .
And I would say that if it comes to me if she was not <unk> it .
A chance of <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> . Let me get this again again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we go , but something .
Let &apos;s take their ideas , or not .
( Applause ) Did you look at his point .
And I did a face .
This time the <unk> changed in the stage .
It was a little bit more <unk> , a little more <unk> than my answer .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you don &apos;t know , if every day is not the way , if you don &apos;t understand , and I didn &apos;t understand that creativity .
This is awesome .
It &apos;s a <unk> experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking to each other when I tell you that we don &apos;t know , of course .
We know that being able to be able to buy a <unk> and to do music is a <unk> .
And what &apos;s going to see that with the music ?
We all the traditional players , our <unk> is not the most of them to do .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m just going to show you how to show you how .
And the other <unk> is that we don &apos;t do <unk> .
There are people who do .
But that , it will be <unk> .
If you look at the side of the side that I want like that , and I say that , and I say that , and I say that , and I say that , and I say that I was going to do that , and I say that I was going to do that .
Now , it was something .
One , two , one , three , four .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a little bit , because I &apos;m going to show you the ideas .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; Take to this . &quot; &quot; If I want to show the music , the best I can do is to listen .
It &apos;s the science of the body .
It has more to see what I can do .
If I want to show you a little level of <unk> , the first step to me , the first step to me is to be patient , listen to what happens .
When you do , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> others players and they get more , and that &apos;s going on .
See , one , one , one , three , four , four .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s something entirely different when I <unk> my ideas .
It &apos;s much further . It has many more <unk> .
It &apos;s not about my vision , it &apos;s nothing .
And I &apos;m going to be in the moment , I was going to each other other and to give them to creativity .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And the <unk> is not going to be <unk> the Internet Internet .
<unk> .
So about the crisis <unk> <unk> .
I just had 18 minutes , because I was just 18 minutes .
( Laughter )
And I think if people don &apos;t know what they could go .
And we have to solve with the same <unk> , and we have to solve with the same .
And as he said in the last few days I was saying in the last days .
or if they have a few years , or if they have a few one of them .
He said , &quot; &quot; This world are two types of people .
If you say , &quot; &quot; We do that &quot; &quot; <unk> to do that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Applause ) One of the biggest <unk> and ( Applause )
It is the <unk> of the color of the <unk> .
( Laughter )
We have to <unk> and that we can save our country , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And we give them to be a <unk> that we give them to <unk> .
You can see the hand , if you can give your hand if you go ?
&quot; &quot; It has extraordinary languages .
But there are things in education that have <unk> <unk> .
We all the <unk> that <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m always <unk> . &quot;
There was a professor who didn &apos;t have to do .
And I was my <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I was my <unk> , &quot; &quot; I was my <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I was my <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I
He said , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s going to be a better opinion , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s better opinion of me . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) <unk> , and that is not the only of the ability to do .
It is the <unk> of what we can do for the ability to be able to be able to be able to do why we do for our ability to be <unk> .
I had a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
( Applause )
And to do that in the right ?
( Applause )
It &apos;s more or less when the <unk> <unk> to the first <unk> <unk> .
And if you &apos;re doing what the most of you , what if you think of the well , what if you look at the right ?
You know , when you &apos;re trying to do something that you can do .
We need to recognize that the human population .
And with a <unk> system in a <unk> curriculum in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> .
There are people who are in the media and the Internet Internet .
<unk> with the talk of the teachers .
He took this to his love .
So , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and then these talks talks and ideas that are being <unk> , <unk> in a position of <unk> here to tell us to the television .
Everyone on the television .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to show you some different ways .
So here in America .
The average one is a <unk> of a <unk> of five hours every day .
Right ?
I &apos;ve been alive on the television , so that for me , is something <unk> .
But people don &apos;t tell you .
They &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> .
My mother , when he was the last girl , he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; My <unk> today , &quot; &quot; My <unk> today , &quot; &quot; My <unk> today , &quot; &quot; <unk> today . &quot; &quot; And my <unk> today is to tell you that the television is consciousness .
If I think of another is consciousness , because you can see the television that will increase the <unk> , social social and <unk> in our nation , and <unk> <unk> in our nation , and we have <unk> ourselves in our agricultural system .
That &apos;s why we call the humans and <unk> our idea of consciousness .
We don &apos;t talk to each other , or <unk> .
We &apos;ve got <unk> television problems .
We talk about 10 programs with a <unk> <unk> during 50 years .
And as that <unk> , not only what you &apos;ve heard , which is the idea of our <unk> and <unk> , if you &apos;re not , how those Americans have <unk> for the <unk> that the idea of our consciousness ?
How are the television for the time , and that says , that <unk> our society ?
It <unk> to the entire evolution of evolution , from an <unk> biology , if the animal Passage , including human beings , has four common <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , power , and the desire of <unk> .
As a human , what there is to remember is that in <unk> , <unk> with time to <unk> , <unk> those activities animals .
We have the ability to laugh and make .
<unk> <unk> , compassion .
That &apos;s not like that in the world .
The other thing is that the human beings is that <unk> .
You can see the television .
And that &apos;s something that we can do in the animal world .
At the animals , you can change , but it &apos;s not going on .
So , I <unk> to find what if we want to think of this relationship of this relationship between the <unk> and human consciousness .
Why did it <unk> ?
Well , I have <unk> like the cartoons of the <unk> and the <unk> in our Valley .
So the television works as our consciousness is <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
So to tell you how questions , we did a study of research .
He was 50 years to the <unk> <unk> 60 <unk> 60 .
<unk> in the end of the audience that there was been over 50 years , thousands years of programs .
We talk to <unk> people , almost <unk> , and 70 years , and <unk> as if they <unk> <unk> .
How do you look at these each of these programs programs ?
You have a moral <unk> ?
<unk> ?
What do you do ?
For our audience , I want to say that this <unk> <unk> in America .
But as you can see , these states have been <unk> .
And the second facts , a 80 percent of the most <unk> of the American American Revolution , the rest of the world .
I want to our <unk> <unk> if our <unk> <unk> .
I want to give you very much people in the two people before it &apos;s going to come to the last slide , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , the same thing to think about the idea of consciousness and the <unk> of consciousness .
And in the way that I &apos;m going to be able to do the data , I want to give you very much at the last <unk> of TED , which is to see .
Well , we go back .
And here you see , since 1960 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things with what we &apos;re going to start the <unk> of <unk> and the state of <unk> , that , for this study , we start to <unk> as the <unk> of television that are going to be able to make better better than in the world .
The moral <unk> are the programs that you don &apos;t have the distinction between well and wrong .
At the beginning , you see that in 1960 <unk> .
So that we see the television .
The moral starts to <unk> .
I looked at the end of the 60 , the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Why ?
The crisis of the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , heating , the war in Iraq , and <unk> <unk> , the scandal <unk> .
So , what happens .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> moral <unk> .
<unk> , but Ronald Reagan , a <unk> , is to control .
And I &apos;m trying to hear the old .
But look at , it cannot be , <unk> , <unk> , the edge of <unk> , <unk> .
The moral <unk> becomes in front of <unk> , until the next 20 years .
So let &apos;s look at this .
This chart shows a lot .
But in this case , we have the <unk> <unk> of the social <unk> and the <unk> in blue and green .
And that &apos;s in the television , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and <unk> <unk> .
It will be <unk> . <unk> everything .
The <unk> starts to buy .
<unk> , the social <unk> .
We have to expand and look what happens .
The <unk> , the <unk> and social social social social , not only are <unk> in our society , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
What was the number one ?
A series of <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; pravastatin , &quot; &quot; and <unk> .
We all <unk> together .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s look at this kind of green <unk> with the trends .
When I mean , let &apos;s say , let me say ?
I mean that in the <unk> of <unk> , the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
This is the first program <unk> to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , I can tell you what I think of the East War , on the <unk> , through the <unk> , through the <unk> , and that is what you might say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you might say , &quot; &quot; That is what you might say , &quot; &quot; That is what you might say , &quot; &quot; That is what you might say , &quot; &quot; That is what you might say , &quot; &quot; That is what you might say
Well , the same thing that in the last look at the last look look at .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television .
The social <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to the 70 of the 70 .
Now look at this .
They were <unk> by 70 ? <unk> .
We have said , &quot; &quot; All of the &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; and the main program in <unk> for all the last decade &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk>
In 50 years , we &apos;ve got to study , seven to 10 programs as a <unk> War .
Well , just a generation , in 20 years , and we &apos;ve found , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; How many of you can do that ?
It might be like that ?
Maybe you ?
And I &apos;m doing this audience so knows , I want to tell you that people in the digital .
<unk> <unk> was <unk> out of his <unk> , and the rest of us is <unk> .
This is another graph . It &apos;s another <unk> : <unk> and imagination , who are programs <unk> like , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; What do you do in front of the <unk> , the <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you that every time I <unk> and <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> .
We want to see <unk> <unk> on the money and <unk> ?
We don &apos;t . We have the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; The wife &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; The man in the decade in
What was <unk> programs ?
<unk> and rich .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
A <unk> of our national <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> : <unk> .
Now , my graph , because these are the last 20 years .
<unk> or not in my <unk> , you know that you have either either about the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
How do we say this <unk> , which is a place .
<unk> , the 1950s , <unk> as &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But look at the <unk> .
As you look at the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Why do ?
We had the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in part of the social <unk> .
<unk> what happens .
So in the last century , or <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
That is what the people in their communities ?
And I realized that <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> , my world are down .
You don &apos;t know the <unk> .
I can see the island of the island .
I can do that the daughter of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can have the new <unk> . You &apos;re <unk> .
Great , right ?
And he <unk> to the <unk> of different who are these programs programs , <unk> food , they were in 50 years .
We are animals , we need our <unk> .
There is no one of a set of <unk> , and the mother <unk> .
At the last decade , we say <unk> in the <unk> program , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> to me &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> to <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the archetype of the <unk> <unk> , which talked about <unk> , the same <unk> in the television .
In the past , he came to the first &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; the way of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> when he happened the idea of being <unk> .
The mother was , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
And I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s one of a <unk> or a <unk> , in our consciousness , as our <unk> , what I know is to do this .
So all of you , women and men are <unk> , the audience of <unk> , thank you by <unk> to the <unk> idea of the television .
But they would also give them to the <unk> <unk> that if they were going to be used to put their ideas in our meal .
<unk> their entire life , safe , but as you <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , through the top of social , <unk> life .
So thank you very much .
( Applause )
In <unk> in a prison , I met a child , I met a kid of 12 years ago , and I would have a kid in 12 years .
And in the eyes of the eyes , I was written to the eyes of the hundreds of <unk> that he had written the sky , never told us a boy for him , because he wasn &apos;t a boy .
It wasn &apos;t a <unk> <unk> .
It was a child <unk> years ago , a bicycle .
What I would also have had to thought was that not only was in a <unk> , but that &apos;s not only was in <unk> , but that &apos;s <unk> in the developing countries that <unk> the right right , and the right right right .
And I realized that there was a <unk> <unk> of opportunities for all of us as a community of <unk> and <unk> , and we realized that the <unk> <unk> like <unk> .
Well , we think in the <unk> as a form of <unk> policy or that he &apos;s made so only for the end , but in fact , 95 percent of the <unk> of today , and they &apos;re not for the poor .
I &apos;m going to people who if you &apos;re in the <unk> <unk> , and unfortunately , what the <unk> is the form of research , it &apos;s smaller than have to have a <unk> system , more than to have a <unk> system , more than to have a <unk> system .
The day today is that if it is possible for us as a community world , if we create that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and this <unk> of three things .
First of the <unk> and the <unk> of power and the <unk> in the world .
The second is <unk> that there is a <unk> trailer , and he <unk> to the <unk> .
And third one is why .
So , at the year , I started <unk> , and if we were <unk> ?
We could do something about these <unk> countries ?
And I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> to you that have a <unk> that has <unk> with the <unk> as the <unk> of research , and you put them to <unk> the <unk> in these countries , <unk> the <unk> in an <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
However , my first <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> , when there was in <unk> , at least <unk> , at least <unk> , even at least 10 years ago , the <unk> <unk> .
And the last 20 years later , so there was just 10 minutes in the country , and so you can see it in a <unk> in not just like a boy <unk> , but you know , in a <unk> of 12 years , my husband is <unk> , but you can &apos;t find it .
The first group of <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> , while I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for ? &quot;
And the <unk> <unk> , and finally , a woman <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And these <unk> had that <unk> of value to decide that <unk> and <unk> between them so they could put them on their behavior .
And I still have <unk> in the first cases , the 25 together , she said , &quot; &quot; No , while she comes down and the rest of the same and the rest of the same way , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , we &apos;re going to do the things in the same way that they have been done .
She <unk> that in fact that I &apos;m going to go back to me and I realized that <unk> <unk> , but the police arrived , and she was <unk> , but she was nothing on .
And so she was <unk> . He was <unk> . He had a <unk> .
And when he went to his case , I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , no human beings , but he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , no human beings , except the <unk> <unk> and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there are no <unk> in a <unk> and another time , and you &apos;ll see , little bit , a little bit to change the polar of history .
But it is not only .
Have you think : So , it &apos;s just <unk> ?
Or also about other countries ?
But it &apos;s happening in other countries .
In <unk> in a prison , and there was a professor boy at 12 years ago , but a child &apos;s a child .
Or a woman , I said , &quot; &quot; My baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s your baby is so <unk> ! &quot; &quot; But it was not a baby , the girl was three years .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; Well , I was <unk> from <unk> two , and a <unk> <unk> to their wife and even so he was in prison .
And when I went on the front of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , we can <unk> , but you look at my prison , the 80 percent of the two of people are here , and we could do ourselves ? &quot; &quot; And then the doctors began to be able to make a system where they could be able to be able to do ? &quot;
And we realized that not only was the ball in the table , but the one of the people who make the difference .
For example , what happened was that .
And then <unk> , &quot; &quot; I say that you can &apos;t help that you can &apos;t help you , you don &apos;t have to create the <unk> of the resources . &quot; &quot; And then <unk> : &quot; &quot; But I want to tell you that you &apos;re going to have been <unk> to the <unk> , &quot; &quot; And then <unk> , &quot; &quot; But I want to show you that the resources of resources was <unk> to the <unk> .
So , and it turns out , the solution we found was the ball and then , <unk> .
So I was in <unk> and I decided I decided to show with another group of him . What was <unk> was that they said , &quot; &quot; No , we don &apos;t have any <unk> in the streets .
What he is going to be so ? &quot; &quot; We found with a <unk> of the development of development , and they were going to be <unk> and <unk> , that it turns .
And they also also <unk> <unk> in fact .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you . &quot; &quot; <unk> everything . &quot; &quot; And they can see the <unk> of them .
<unk> were perfectly <unk> .
But they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . ( Laughter ) I had all <unk> at the office of the <unk> , which was <unk> with them as well ? &quot; &quot; And after a <unk> , <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And so so the benefits of the <unk> is not only the <unk> of the table , but to find a way that you &apos;re not only , and you can find a way that they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
And while I &apos;m going to do that , I also hope that it &apos;s like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , it seems like if I could do , but we actually do it , but actually do something .
And they are so many of the reasons I think if it &apos;s possible .
The first one of them is that the people about the <unk> of the <unk> so that &apos;s people in the <unk> .
And not only , I &apos;m not <unk> , who &apos;s talking about <unk> , but also <unk> around all the world that are looking at at the entire <unk> .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people <unk> and I wanted to help , but how we can help ?
So it &apos;s only one <unk> in which if you can go to five billion dollars if you think about five idea , if you think about five idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s 30 percent in all the world , from the ammonia <unk> to <unk> or the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , which with five billion dollars doing things , <unk> <unk> and any way that they are .
And not just there are not just these <unk> , but they also also <unk> that they &apos;re trying to think of what they are their functions and how they can do with them .
For example , in China , it &apos;s <unk> that the cops could <unk> people have had been <unk> .
And while I was sitting in one of our <unk> , I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; How we can <unk> ? &quot; &quot; How we can have <unk> ?
This is great . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t think the same way . &quot;
I &apos;ve learned in the fact that we need to do and support <unk> .
We need need to have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
But the third and last , the most important , is that we <unk> with this .
And people said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s very well , but it &apos;s too well .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason why I knew that this opinion is that this point is exactly the same thing that they decided to do with the <unk> or mood .
It has a small group of people who decided to <unk> .
One of our favorite <unk> of <unk> , which they share between themselves , is , &quot; &quot; Well , none of you , the way , the way you &apos;ve been talking about themselves , and there &apos;s a lot of that if we can change as a community world .
And I always <unk> , because I know that the question is — ( Laughter ) <unk> to speak with you , &quot; &quot; But what I can do really ? &quot; &quot; Well , what I can do really ? &quot; &quot; Well , I can you know what you can do .
It was a child four years when I met I met in a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> . &quot; &quot; But the <unk> in prison , all they had a lot of injuries , even the one of the <unk> .
And of course , as you know , there are <unk> . And so when he started to <unk> , that is what it can also call ?
What he was going to do was to be the first <unk> , and the second and then the third , and then , very <unk> , he moved to head to the head , because what he wanted to do was to do the first day .
And of course , never to visit to everyone around the world every day , but if I wanted to raise all the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Or if the <unk> were that , was as <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> <unk> , he took their <unk> .
And the most part of the <unk> that was his greatest <unk> and his sun is always <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . A kid .
It had been in a prison at almost no medical goods , but with a sense of their own <unk> <unk> , which is a sense of their own <unk> <unk> , which is , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to do it all .
But they &apos;re a person , I can do something .
And he <unk> the only thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; And so that you &apos;re going to be able to have a <unk> for you to imagine the ball in a world , with all us together , and I &apos;m going to do this with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
A few people think there are a bunch of people they think , &quot; &quot; We call a talk in a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; &quot; <unk> a story of childhood . &quot;
&quot; &quot; It was a <unk> to a personal <unk> .
<unk> with a <unk> called the action .
No .
It &apos;s not like that as I think of a TED .
In fact , if you look too much of these devices , you have a <unk> or a emotional <unk> .
But there is a thing that all the big talks have seen they have in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because I &apos;ve learned you to share with some hundreds of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with the talks of time , and I learned that the talks of a big talk .
And they still have these <unk> and their joy they are different , all they have a common ground .
And it &apos;s this : The main task as <unk> is to the mind of who you &apos;ll hear a gift , a <unk> , and beautiful object , we call it idea .
Let me go .
This is <unk> .
And this is to give you a TED Talk , and he <unk> , is <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) If you &apos;ve got a number of people , so many of what they never could before before they were expected to think of what their brains will be <unk> in the brain of <unk> and between them .
They &apos;re literally <unk> , the same brain regions .
And not just want to say that they are <unk> the same emotions .
Let &apos;s take a look at the brain of a moment .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look at here , right here , a few million people are connected to each other way .
And within the minds of the audience .
It &apos;s like this , just in a couple of minutes , a <unk> <unk> that are going to be a <unk> of neurons , just with a face .
But what is a idea ?
Well , you can <unk> how a <unk> <unk> that help , understand the world .
And the ideas of many forms and <unk> , from the commercials , and we &apos;ll go back and <unk> .
So there are a couple of examples to the stage .
<unk> <unk> is the future of our children .
( Video ) <unk> <unk> : The <unk> is that the creativity now , and we should be <unk> with the same thing .
Chris Anderson : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> <unk> : You know , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , is <unk> .
CA : <unk> <unk> <unk> people , more than a simple identity of our simple .
Video <unk> : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they &apos;re <unk> , is that they are <unk> .
CA : So your mind is <unk> ideas , and not the <unk> .
They &apos;re trying to show you connected .
<unk> , <unk> a amazing structure that &apos;s a lot of a complex structure that is to be a <unk> of the world .
It &apos;s the system of your brain .
It &apos;s like <unk> .
And <unk> of millions of ideas .
If , for example , a small <unk> of your view of the world is that the idea of the <unk> are <unk> , then , to the green of this , <unk> like that .
But if another <unk> of your view of the world is that the idea of your brain is , then , the green is , the green <unk> of a different little .
So , it &apos;s quite unbelievable that the ideas that are going to be able to look at the world .
<unk> that are more likely to be possible , an name for <unk> , but wonderful real real world .
Now , the different people in the world , they can be very different .
For example , how responds to your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) <unk> <unk> : What you think of you ?
&quot; &quot; A woman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
CA : Whatever is the answer , there are millions of people there are outside that <unk> .
If you look at the right , they &apos;re able to change , for always , the way , the way that you can see the world and transform their actions .
The ideas are more powerful than the human culture .
So if I &apos;m going to tell you that the good task as <unk> is to build a sense of the minds in your audience , here you go four to address that task is : First of your talk to address that : First of your talk to the single idea .
The ideas are very complex ; you need to have the content to <unk> the content idea that more <unk> , and they have the chance to <unk> well .
You have to get context , share examples , to do .
So we took a sense of that , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> that <unk> all of your talk , so that all the <unk> of a way .
Second , I &apos;m going to tell you a reason for it .
Before we start to build things on the minds in your audience , you have to have her their daughters to get .
And what is the tool for that ?
<unk> .
We took curiosity in your audience .
<unk> questions like <unk> , <unk> to try to try to identify why something that doesn &apos;t have work , and they need the explanation .
If you can see , and you can take a <unk> in the world of someone , I &apos;m going to need to <unk> that <unk> .
And when I <unk> that wish is much more simple enough to build the idea .
Third , I &apos;m going to do this idea , a piece of speculation that &apos;s going to do this .
<unk> the power of language to take together together , and there &apos;s no real power of language , who is not in your language , in their language .
They were where they are .
The <unk> ones have <unk> that a lot of learning and other people who are completely useful for their audience .
Well , the <unk> <unk> a little bit to show you how huge sea , because they were <unk> the way of the <unk> in the <unk> , in a idea that who wants to do .
For example , when I &apos;m going to tell you that the incredible news is called <unk> , said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> DNA .
The <unk> allows you , and we decided that genetic information too easily . &quot; &quot; Well , a human explanation like this , &quot; &quot; Well , a human beings , like this <unk> , a big moment in our mind .
It &apos;s important , for the body , the talk to talk with a <unk> friends , and see that parts are more <unk> .
<unk> . This is going on the end of the end : I know my ideas will be <unk> .
So that I mean you to say that you do this question : &quot; &quot; I call this idea ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell this idea ? &quot;
And we need to <unk> the answer .
If the idea just you get to you and your brain , then I feel you , probably you probably feel , probably probably not feel it .
The audience will increase through you .
But if you think the idea has the potential to <unk> , and somebody &apos;s trying to change the perspective of someone to do the better , so you have to do the things else , so you have to be a gift for them and all of us .
We just give a 25 percent of what we &apos;ve heard .
<unk> that <unk> every day .
( Laughter ) And with this <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s hard to listen to me ; listen to me .
And the art of the <unk> , the art of the conversation .
A world where we don &apos;t know each other .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s actually <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
For example , this is my <unk> .
We look at the sounds that they can be very important if they were attention .
The sound is my passion , is the <unk> life .
Imagine that you &apos;re a little bit of a place in America and <unk> a <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , what is the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you might say , &quot; &quot; <unk> — well , this is the <unk> <unk> Street , is that <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , that the 27 boy . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; All right . What &apos;s name at the name ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; Well , are you don &apos;t have this .
The streets of these <unk> , their <unk> only are <unk> without name the streets . &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> , a little bit <unk> and <unk> .
Now imagine you , imagine a little bit about no place , <unk> to the person who you have to go and ask , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is my orchestra , and I say , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; , the
<unk> .
Look at Google here . There are my shoes , and I &apos;m going to 14 , 15 , 16 .
All those of these apples have these <unk> . <unk> only are the <unk> without the name of apples .
And then you might say , &quot; &quot; So how you do the <unk> of your home ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is <unk> .
<unk> 17 , house or one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , &quot; &quot; OK , &quot; &quot; OK , &quot; &quot; OK , &quot; &quot; OK , &quot; &quot; OK . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) <unk> : &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; You know , you are .
The first <unk> <unk> in one is the home number one .
The second is that if we <unk> is the home number two .
The third one is the home number of three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s unbelievable .
Like , for example , there are doctors in the pump that they think their job is <unk> .
So every month ago you &apos;re out of you , and when I &apos;m not going to be <unk> because you think of them , and when I &apos;m not going to be <unk> because you &apos;re <unk> in your job .
( Applause ) And in the music , we think the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the time , &quot; &quot; is the beginning , &quot; &quot; one , three , four .
But in the music of Africa , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the end of the phrase , as the point of a sentence .
So you know to listen to not only in the <unk> , but in the way , three , four , four .
And this is also real and we need to do .
( Laughter ) There are a saying that for anything that for any thing that if I knew about India , the opposite is being true .
So we didn &apos;t have to never , so that in TED as a place , that for any idea that we have or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> can also be true .
<unk> <unk> .
