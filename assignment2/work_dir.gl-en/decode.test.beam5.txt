It was a few miles of 2005 .
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> , the European Union <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s my job , but that day , <unk> a little bit <unk> .
So I was going to go back to me from my email here .
Now , Chris &apos;s about 30 years working on the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the institutions .
And I told me that I want a little bit <unk> .
I was <unk> a series of you about the <unk> of science and <unk> , very interesting .
But I wanted to get to <unk> these problems .
Now , Chris was a big , and you said , &quot; &quot; All those things , which are the top of <unk> , which are the <unk> of <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; Well , the technologies <unk> , the <unk> and ...
<unk> , there is a great thing , and I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> as <unk> <unk> and ...
Of course , what is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s mostly of genes as human .
No !
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> in the human body ?
You can &apos;t be , &quot; &quot; <unk> to my <unk> and <unk> to my ear three .
And 20 minutes later , he came to me .
&quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you are <unk> ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s Chris , a big <unk> , but I didn &apos;t know about anything about the whole of <unk> , and it &apos;s nothing about genetic .
I know something about genetic , but it was not <unk> , much less <unk> <unk> .
And so there was a lot that there was a lot to learn before .
First of all , we had to know what if they were trying to do when somebody was <unk> .
Our genetic genetic <unk> <unk> , but the more <unk> of all are the <unk> , &quot; &quot; DNA , &quot; &quot; or a piece of DNA , &quot; &quot; or a piece of DNA , &quot; &quot; or your piece of DNA , or a piece of DNA .
The <unk> of this say , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t see the genes of your body , <unk> your genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , but the problem is <unk> that you need to change the genes for <unk> .
And the <unk> isn &apos;t to be a <unk> gene in particular , but all the logic of that gene .
And what does that ?
Well , you don &apos;t think of your genes , a physician and <unk> that the <unk> , so you can see if you look at that , without the patient &apos;s <unk> .
And they also have <unk> that the <unk> of the scanner , that gene will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that gene .
<unk> that these <unk> , they &apos;ve been interested in the human genome was the <unk> to the patients .
We have the case , a little bit about , a little bit about 10 years with the North <unk> , a disease that , if it comes to death .
The company that I &apos;ve learned the two genes associated with this disease , <unk> a test for stereotypes .
But then he went into <unk> and never the <unk> <unk> .
But the company that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> with <unk> <unk> to him .
And two years without to do that .
For that time , <unk> was <unk> .
Our genetic genetic were a problem that we could do patients .
How do we have any way in the front ?
Well , it turns out that the <unk> was in a long <unk> <unk> , which is a series of things that are not <unk> .
You can &apos;t see products of the nature : air , the water , the elements of the <unk> , the elements of the <unk> .
And they don &apos;t even the laws of nature : the law <unk> , <unk> .
And they &apos;re very important , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit of all .
In our opinion that DNA , the structure of life , the structure of life , that encode the production of all our proteins , is so a <unk> of the nature as a <unk> of the nature , <unk> <unk> that if we &apos;re <unk> in our bodies or the <unk> of the <unk> .
To make better , <unk> for all the country to speak with different aspects of different : scientific <unk> , who <unk> doctors , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Most of us , we had to have a point of the political sphere , and when less research , at commitment , from a second point .
You all know that the kids are going to go with with our stuff that they were so .
But why ?
It turns out that the office of <unk> has been <unk> at the top 20 years .
<unk> , there was thousands of <unk> in humans .
The <unk> of <unk> was very <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the U.K. <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> around this , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> year after a year .
Briefly , the <unk> don &apos;t have to be passionate the <unk> of these stuff .
But , and they can &apos;t go and myself , and I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> , &quot; &quot; We have to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
So we started through our causes .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> and so that <unk> , dark .
And we don &apos;t get to be that kind of causes , we think our causes to be much more .
<unk> from freedom , the rich or physician and the joy of patients .
So we decided to take a signal that would not be like the <unk> that there are <unk> , but one causes the <unk> of <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to be able to try to be a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that she had been <unk> their <unk> , so he had a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of these <unk> and innovation .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that what was going to do was <unk> <unk> , a company with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the end of two genes , the genes <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> women with certain mutations that are more likely more likely to <unk> cancer , and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
He told me that a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You have a lot of money on the test : I &apos;ve got a lot of money .
So I &apos;m going to share your data with the front of the community , the community .
And , if it &apos;s the worst of all , for a period of a <unk> years ago , I was <unk> to him for his test for that <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> by a team of nitric oxide .
<unk> that for that time , for a few years ago , until a 12 percent of the women who were doing the <unk> of an answer , a result that should be <unk> .
This is <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for 40 years , and he did the <unk> <unk> .
The test <unk> .
The family <unk> .
The more thing was that cancer diagnosis is not in the family , which the other <unk> of the family couldn &apos;t make the test .
But two years later , the <unk> <unk> a number of <unk> in the window .
It has been <unk> that <unk> about that 12 percent of people who give them a result of <unk> .
If you look at the result , you would have a test the test , and using the <unk> of <unk> .
And they were to <unk> these problems .
<unk> enough , we &apos;ve been <unk> enough , and in a organizations , for the most of a scientific scientific <unk> , or <unk> , and women , and women who do not could be used by <unk> , or a doctors , and women are <unk> that or well .
One of the largest points that I &apos;ve learned in this case was to think the way to think the science .
For my <unk> that I had was <unk> was a <unk> , and that the genes would have been a <unk> , and we had to find a couple of basic network , we had to make a sense ? What ?
What if the DNA is , and why is not a <unk> ?
We spend hours hours of hours and hours with our <unk> and <unk> , trying to do with the way to try and <unk> .
And at the end , by the end , by the end , as the gold .
So you can DNA , it &apos;s like <unk> or a <unk> or the <unk> of a <unk> .
You can see the process of the process to do anything , but you can &apos;t make your own own gold .
It has the job if the job is going to be able to give you the gold of the mountain ; you can &apos;t see it , it &apos;s probably .
And the gold , a <unk> , you can do in all sorts of things in the <unk> that you can &apos;t use when he was in the mountain ; with it <unk> to make <unk> , for example , but you can &apos;t feel any gold , because it &apos;s effective .
In 2009 , we were ready to understand the case .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of New York City , and the <unk> <unk> , to the <unk> , the first Robert <unk> .
In 2010 , the <unk> <unk> his <unk> his <unk> : <unk> <unk> . A <unk> of us .
When you look at their opinion , <unk> the <unk> with the science in the case .
I mean , our mathematics â€” was a good , but not as good .
How could have to develop a knowledge of the <unk> of that time ?
You can &apos;t think of how they could do something like that .
So he turned to what he was called the British <unk> , not just <unk> , it was scientist .
And not just was a scientist , he was a <unk> in biology biology .
( Laughter )
So he was inspired by the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And here &apos;s the things that happens .
First , in a moment , the government in the United States .
In the <unk> of the <unk> , the government <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> .
But in <unk> with your own office , the government <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> , the government <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , and he <unk> that the DNA was not <unk> to be <unk> .
So this was very important , and it &apos;s absolutely advanced .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , all the cases of <unk> , and it &apos;s called his <unk> <unk> , very <unk> of <unk> .
So even with this , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And so it was .
Rather , or less .
The decision it was in one .
But the two <unk> that starts into us , did it &apos;s not different .
The first one , the <unk> <unk> , he took his own language , so it &apos;s actually <unk> .
( Laughter )
And I &apos;m going to tell you that , which is no sense .
The other job , the <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> with us , &quot; &quot; <unk> with us .
But what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; The third one , <unk> , the reason .
You have to make a question that you have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So , these questions are <unk> the way of a <unk> <unk> , a lot of a month with lots of <unk> , &quot; &quot; where you might say &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
We did that if they were the question , the more thing we &apos;ve seen .
<unk> , are a <unk> ?
Now , Chris told me what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I think you might say , &quot; &quot; is the DNA <unk> ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want to have the same reaction that I had the same thing that I was talking about this is about seven years .
The <unk> <unk> only <unk> on one percent of the cases , and you can see our own .
And the day of the <unk> , and it was very exciting , very exciting , with many people out , people who had a few people out to try to be <unk> .
Two organizations against the cancer , which is the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
Now , Chris , and I &apos;m going together together , before he <unk> the <unk> , the most important thing in the career .
I was much more valuable than he .
But all that panic you have been in in the room , and I saw my <unk> , a lot of waste , etc , and I saw my <unk> , a lot of waste , and I saw my <unk> , and I saw my <unk> , and I saw the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
In the <unk> , they were three times from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the DNA , she said , &quot; &quot; You know , who &apos;s <unk> a report to do that day , in the <unk> that he had a lot of what we had on .
<unk> was <unk> .
Now , Chris <unk> .
But for me , the more <unk> was to see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> trying to understand the DNA , through a series of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , in the last seven years .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the DNA with the DNA with an <unk> <unk> .
The British <unk> <unk> with doing a <unk> <unk> .
And at the time was my point , the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the DNA will call &quot; &quot; it was nature to <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know , when I was <unk> to <unk> , but we should be <unk> the result .
&quot; &quot; A <unk> natural DNA is a <unk> of nature , and it &apos;s not <unk> to be so so just had <unk> .
And what &apos;s more , I &apos;m going to do nothing . &quot; &quot; <unk> and four hours of <unk> , five pounds , five <unk> <unk> that <unk> the test for the test for the genes .
Some of them took them to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> than <unk> .
Some of the <unk> , one of the most <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> beyond <unk> .
<unk> with a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> genes in America .
<unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
And he said to that patients , <unk> , <unk> , he had had to have the <unk> <unk> that they live .
<unk> weeks later , the <unk> <unk> your decision , I got a tiny small plain in the email .
It was <unk> , a professor of <unk> University , and one of the first people that I love , and Chris was going to go down to visit , and if you were going to go to visit to me , a professor of <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> long with this case .
<unk> of what they took the <unk> of all the risks , so we were doing the right thing .
The <unk> <unk> almost eight years from the beginning to end , with many <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , <unk> , but they have the communities that <unk> , and the <unk> that we <unk> , and the <unk> that we have to see .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi , I &apos;m going to show you a few years of my projects , <unk> to me a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we live in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , I call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> in my aunt , &quot; &quot; <unk> in my husband &apos;s dream of my name <unk> to do things for him , almost as if I was going to show you a <unk> of water , or the lights you do things , almost like it &apos;s <unk> .
When I grew up , the thing was the worse and they &apos;re seeing as a way of control .
And of course , I can &apos;t say anything anything because my guy never never know because my name is a very <unk> in the family .
The more <unk> and <unk> was the <unk> of the phone .
He <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> to the number of it .
And in the answer , and he was written , &quot; &quot; The phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so much of people to use two people to use .
It &apos;s exactly the way that my great <unk> is a <unk> of a person .
The problem is that , when I <unk> home and I went back to <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> .
And so I did a <unk> machine with what I could give their memories to <unk> and <unk> around all the world together .
What he had to do was to take a paper , a paper , a role in the <unk> , he used to write the email .
This device <unk> <unk> to the person in a form of email .
So you can see that they &apos;re going to be a lot of <unk> <unk> that they live all of the <unk> and <unk> .
So my name is , my <unk> , <unk> .
And of course , the object has to be <unk> and have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , as you like to my name .
The next job is , one device that we call &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , twins and <unk> .
That works like this . We have these <unk> here in the wall , and behind , we have these small creatures that are <unk> .
( Laughter ) What we do on its silence , <unk> .
And if there is more silence , <unk> <unk> .
And they are <unk> , <unk> .
So we have these <unk> in three walls of a room .
And we had to study out of these little little <unk> behind .
And so it works .
This is a prototype prototype .
When there &apos;s silence , let &apos;s go .
And we <unk> like humans or the human creatures .
And then , <unk> the sounds of the <unk> in the end .
They don &apos;t know the sounds of inequality .
And we took a <unk> in a moment that doesn &apos;t worry .
( Laughter ) But interestingly , for the sounds of first . It &apos;s a second .
( Laughter ) We very hard to do the simplest , as possible .
Each of it has their own behavior , <unk> , changes in humor , <unk> , etc .
This is a active .
And of course , was the best after that .
We had to <unk> people , but we think the people was quite <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get them .
This is a device , &quot; &quot; The person &apos;s &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; We have <unk> with the idea of <unk> with <unk> .
How would it be possible to be possible ?
We worked with a <unk> company , and we asked them to give you a <unk> , and we asked them to give you a <unk> , you could see the people in the room , to watch it .
And I &apos;m going to show you a very short .
In the right , you can see my colleague <unk> , which is in the space .
And the left , you &apos;ll see the video <unk> where the hidden camera .
<unk> up on the phone . Oh !
You can see how the camera is it and <unk> .
It &apos;s a new video , which is still not <unk> the <unk> and all that , but it &apos;s going to be honest , more .
This is a room where there was a camera where there was a camera on the space , and we had an <unk> in every wall .
And second people come in the room , <unk> to themselves at the same as well , but by a difference , a person was lost where you want to focus on the room .
This job is called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; It was almost a <unk> of paper , like a <unk> of paper , like a <unk> <unk> of oil or a sun .
So in front , this object , it turns to be very strong and <unk> and <unk> , almost very weak .
People have been working on the room and almost <unk> thinking that was some <unk> .
But instead about it , <unk> the <unk> through the wall .
<unk> and <unk> always .
( Laughter ) This job is a <unk> of a man .
His head , it came out , full of rain ; it seems to be that he &apos;s going on in his <unk> and his <unk> <unk> , almost like a tail .
What you do is to move around on their head as if he was written in a <unk> motion .
It &apos;s like that .
Because if you didn &apos;t go out there , and the only one will be there and the only had the space .
And there are no <unk> .
<unk> one example . When people go into the room , this object .
And , very slowly , in the minutes , it turns out , <unk> <unk> and it seems to be the point of <unk> .
This is a moment because I was going to be <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> of almost go and help , to save the subject .
But I still still not know because he &apos;s same because he &apos;s going to see again .
This job was a <unk> challenge for us and work very hard , as well as well , as most of our jobs , for years , and a lot .
It was very important for us to be <unk> at the <unk> that <unk> , because if we were <unk> , because they were <unk> , and if you don &apos;t get the <unk> , or that effect , and if you &apos;re going to want to go to the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to show you a very quickly , we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . He will go .
Now it &apos;s incredibly nervous , so it &apos;s going to go .
But they don &apos;t need to do , because it &apos;s going to be <unk> by the same .
This is a job that we &apos;ve got very <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the skin with the skin with thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> like the sky .
And it &apos;s the scale of the sky .
And I &apos;m going to be that about a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> , which was <unk> from the floor .
The idea was <unk> something so cold , <unk> and <unk> like the universe with the way with the way with the way with the way with the way of <unk> .
The idea was that at that moment , let me look at the way of the way of the <unk> of <unk> and almost the <unk> as a <unk> in space , like <unk> .
This is the last job , even in the process , and he &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; Imagine a <unk> of <unk> . &quot; &quot; Imagine a <unk> of <unk> . &quot; &quot; So you see a <unk> of your front of you in the room and that , as you can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the room .
This object is in <unk> and <unk> to create a lot of people to create a lot of people , like <unk> , like <unk> <unk> in your way , or something like that .
We work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t do that , because in the way , because we live much suffering in our work for years .
But we used to use because in the way that we &apos;ve learned in the way that we have learned together and patterns in these creatures that we create .
When a <unk> <unk> in the mind , and almost as the process of the <unk> was to <unk> the way that this <unk> cannot be , that way to take them and like to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start you to start with a natural trick useful , and everything else &apos;s about you is : that <unk> <unk> for two minutes .
But before I mean , I want to <unk> right now that you can see your body and what you &apos;re doing with with him .
Now , how many of you are in a <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes we give them themselves .
Sometimes . ( Laughter ) I see you see .
<unk> attention to what you do right now .
Let &apos;s go back to that in a few minutes , and I hope that if you give them a little bit you can <unk> the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re <unk> with language language and <unk> , language language .
You know , <unk> , this is , ( Laughter ) <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of hands .
<unk> : Here they are now in the number of 10 .
This police have been to go and go into the U.S. at the United States .
That &apos;s the first Minister â€” I don &apos;t . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) <unk> : A <unk> of hands , or his friend , you can have to speak for weeks , and weeks , it can be <unk> for weeks , weeks .
The same <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So when we think of this expression , we don &apos;t have <unk> or language â€” we don &apos;t think of language , so much of communication .
So when we talk to think about it .
What do it does with your language ?
What about my kids ?
There are reasons to believe that is to believe that .
<unk> , we have to take a lot of time , or on other people , about the <unk> .
We do <unk> and <unk> language language .
And the <unk> that you can &apos;t see that in the life like that you have <unk> or <unk> or asked what you want to do a email .
For example , <unk> in the University of <unk> , you see that when you look at 30 years , you see that when you look at 30 years , you see that a physician will be <unk> or not .
So it doesn &apos;t have to see that if the doctor was the doctor was or not , but it &apos;s not going to be , but like you .
<unk> more <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in a second percent , the 70 percent of the entire career .
If you do a bad wrong , you do ?
Speaking of language isn &apos;t to talk about how to <unk> each other , as we &apos;re working on us and what they are .
But he <unk> to another another audience in which our language is not <unk> , that we are .
<unk> our language is not <unk> , our thoughts , and glue .
Well , what &apos;s language I &apos;m not about ?
It &apos;s social <unk> . He <unk> the <unk> and I asked them in a <unk> school school , so he was <unk> that I couldn &apos;t stop the power of power .
You know about all the way not <unk> and <unk> .
What are the <unk> and <unk> ?
Well , they are this .
In the animal points , they have to see with the <unk> of the animal , they have to see with the top of the animal , they have to see with the top of the animal , they have to see with the top of the animal , they have to see with the top of the animal , they have to see with the top of the animal , they have to see with the top of the animal , they have to see with the top of the animal , they have to see with the
It &apos;s going to be big , <unk> , <unk> space .
It &apos;s <unk> .
And it works like the animal lobe , and it works .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be honest .
So we do the same thing . ( Laughter ) <unk> so when they have power to be able to be able to be able to work in the moment .
This is especially interesting because we &apos;re looking at the <unk> and <unk> that are these <unk> in power .
This expression , we call the <unk> <unk> , it was <unk> by <unk> .
It says that the people who see since they were <unk> that they &apos;re <unk> the same when they put an competition competition .
So that when you take the air line , and they didn &apos;t never know if they never never seen .
They do that .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> something <unk> .
What do we do that when we do it ?
We do just just the opposite .
<unk> .
<unk> .
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> with who &apos;s our point .
And so the animals do we do the same thing .
And that &apos;s what happens when we &apos;re working with <unk> .
So what I &apos;m going to do when when it comes to when it comes to the language doesn &apos;t change .
So if somebody &apos;s really powerful if you get very powerful , they will increase the <unk> .
We do the opposite .
If you see this behavior in the class , which <unk> ?
You know that the way of the <unk> <unk> , all the language couldn &apos;t be <unk> .
There are people who are interested in <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> in the same way before the class , as if they <unk> <unk> space .
When they go back , they go back .
<unk> your hand like that .
And there are other people who have <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> in his face and in his body , you &apos;re going on , you go back , and you do that when you look at your hand .
So here &apos;s two things .
One &apos;t you get to <unk> .
You have to have to see .
Women are more <unk> to do that men .
The women <unk> always less than people , so that this is not surprising .
But the other thing that I &apos;m going to do is that it seems to be passionate about that it seems to be honest with that research .
And that &apos;s really important in the class of the <unk> , because of course the average ceremony .
Our schools are trying to do with the distinction of <unk> .
<unk> women , and men would be <unk> and then you see these differences in <unk> , which is being <unk> in part of the <unk> .
So I started to <unk> : if you are people who come with that attitude and <unk> , and I started to <unk> .
And it would be possible to do that other <unk> and that the bacteria will get more ?
My <unk> <unk> , which is in <unk> , and I realized that if you can bring it to do it .
I mean , you can only do it , you can only do it only , and you want a result in your behavior that you do much more powerful ?
We know that language doesn &apos;t make that other people think they think and they think of us . There are lots of tests .
But our question was , by our question , <unk> language doesn &apos;t make what it works and we think of it ?
There &apos;s some test that is .
For example , we &apos;re looking at when you &apos;re happy , but also when you &apos;re going to be able to give them to him , but also when they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> on the two <unk> .
And when it comes to power , it works in the two <unk> .
When we do it is more likely to do that , but it &apos;s also possible that when you do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we really <unk> .
Well , a second question was , well , we know that the mind is our body , but it &apos;s true also that the body <unk> our mind ?
And when I say , in the case , I &apos;m talking about ?
Well , I &apos;m looking up at it , and and the connections of the <unk> that are going to look at those thoughts , and in my case , I &apos;m talking about hormones .
What is the mind of the <unk> of the <unk> that are not ?
People tend to be , it &apos;s not surprising , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> .
They have to be <unk> that they &apos;re looking at at least games .
They also tend to think of a more <unk> .
There are a lot of differences . It &apos;s more risks .
There are a lot of the differences between us and what are not the sound .
It has also <unk> if they live differences in two hormones : the <unk> , which is the hormone <unk> , and the <unk> , which is the essence of stress .
<unk> <unk> with very much power on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and levels <unk> <unk> .
That means that ? We talk to speak , <unk> to just the <unk> , because he had to see with <unk> .
But the power has has to see with our reaction to our reaction .
We want to be a model , with a very power of power , with <unk> <unk> , but creating your stress ?
It &apos;s not , right ?
We want a person who is powerful , and we want to do it , but not very important to the stress , a person who is going to do .
We know that in the <unk> of <unk> , if you look at the control of <unk> , if someone has to make the control , if someone has to make the control , to take a lot of time and <unk> <unk> .
We have that evidence , which is the body can <unk> the mind , at least the <unk> level , and also that the paper can <unk> the mind .
So what happens when you look at one of the paper ? What is if you look at the same level , like this little <unk> or <unk> ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; I want to do that for two minutes , you might be like that , that you might do it more powerful , that .
<unk> to bring people in the lab and to do a little experiment , those people have <unk> , for two minutes , through the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to show you right now five of these <unk> , and yet they &apos;re going to be right now .
This is one .
One more more more than a couple of more than a couple of more more than a couple of more more than one of more than a more than one of more more than a couple of more more than a couple of more more than a couple of more more than one more than one of more than a couple of more more than a couple of more more than one more than one of more than a couple of more more than a couple of more more than one of more than a more than a more
This is the <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Here we have a couple more .
You can be <unk> , or sitting .
Here they are <unk> .
And let &apos;s look at the small .
This is very <unk> .
When I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , really .
This is what happens .
They come down , <unk> in a <unk> , and he <unk> for two minutes : &quot; &quot; You have to do this , &quot; &quot; You have to do this , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t do that , or that . &quot;
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> with a concept of power .
We want to focus on the power .
They have to have this two minutes .
And then <unk> , &quot; &quot; how <unk> <unk> you ? And then we give the chance to put on them , at the end of them .
That &apos;s all . This is the experiment .
This is what we found .
<unk> at the risk , we found on them ; we find that when they &apos;re in a very large scale of <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
When they are in the <unk> <unk> , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
Let &apos;s see what we found with <unk> .
It <unk> of his situation in the way , the people <unk> that , the people have been driven from the 20 percent .
And again , for the two minutes , and we took those changes .
Now the results of the <unk> .
The more <unk> than a 25 percent of the <unk> , the more <unk> than a number about 15 percent .
We just two minutes of <unk> these changes in the <unk> that <unk> your brain to do it , or <unk> , or <unk> , or well , well , well , well , well , or <unk> as <unk> .
We all know that it works .
<unk> that our language will not be <unk> in the way of the same way , not only the way , but the way .
The body can <unk> the mind .
So the next question , of course , is â€” can a gesture of power in the <unk> , the life expectancy ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , is just two minutes .
Where do you really do that ?
That &apos;s what we call .
We think where they need is in <unk> in the <unk> that you have <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> your friends .
For adolescents is in the front of the prison <unk> .
For some people , I &apos;m going to speak on the school .
It might be in the head , or a <unk> <unk> like this , and I &apos;m going to show you a talk like this or going to be a <unk> of job .
It &apos;s one with the most people of people , if many <unk> , because many of <unk> .
So the results of the results , the media <unk> and said , well , that &apos;s what you do when you &apos;re going to go to an <unk> , right ?
( Laughter ) In contrast , and we said , &quot; &quot; No , no God , you don &apos;t know what we call .
For many reasons , we don &apos;t do that .
So again , it &apos;s not if it comes to other people .
It &apos;s talking with with you .
What do you do before I go to the one of the job ? <unk> that .
You &apos;re sitting in the <unk> , you &apos;re going to do your wallet â€” or your form .
And I &apos;m going to give you a different side , you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> small , when what you should be doing doing is that , maybe in <unk> , right ?
That is what we want to do , right ?
<unk> people in the lab , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you could see that again , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> in the job <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
For five minutes of five minutes . <unk> <unk> .
And they also are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> for not , not just <unk> like that .
Imagine that this person is saying .
For five minutes , nothing , is worse than you .
People to get this .
It &apos;s what we call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And this <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> of the <unk> , because we wanted to see what <unk> .
We have <unk> through the ocean , four .
They don &apos;t know what they can do .
They don &apos;t have the idea of that very remote <unk> every person , and the <unk> of all the men , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to <unk> these people , &quot; &quot; all the <unk> of power .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
And what was happening ?
It &apos;s not about it from content .
It &apos;s the presence of the <unk> .
Because the <unk> of all those <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> ?
Is it right ? How do they do ?
These things don &apos;t affect . That &apos;s what it has .
This kind of things .
Every person is yes , basically .
You know what they are .
<unk> their ideas , for themselves , without the way .
So this is what it is , or the effect .
When I &apos;m talking to people about this , that our body will change our mind and the behavior can change our way to be , &quot; &quot; It is <unk> . &quot;
And I said , <unk> to do you .
I don &apos;t know that .
I don &apos;t want to get there and <unk> like a <unk> .
You don &apos;t want to remember as a <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to get there there for me that I couldn &apos;t get there .
This is very important for me , because I want to tell you a little bit story about being a little story about being a <unk> , and how they didn &apos;t get to be there .
When I was <unk> years old , a car car .
It was <unk> , and a lot of it , and a lot of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the car .
I put in in front of <unk> in a head on the head of <unk> and I realized my <unk> , I was my <unk> <unk> , I was very <unk> .
I was my <unk> , because I was <unk> as <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
So I was <unk> of <unk> , and we &apos;ll go back .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t see the career .
You have to accept that there are other things that you can do , but in your case that you can do , but in your case that don &apos;t .
It &apos;s absolutely <unk> .
And I worked and I worked on , and I came down and I worked and I worked and I worked on , and I worked .
At the <unk> of <unk> .
It &apos;s four years old , more than my colleagues , and I &apos;m going to tell you someone , my <unk> <unk> , so I &apos;m going to tell you , my <unk> <unk> , so I was <unk> , so I &apos;m going to be there .
The night before the exhibition <unk> .
It &apos;s so .
And I was so fear of the next day I day , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to you . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; <unk> to me . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be nothing , because I &apos;m going to you .
You go down , and that &apos;s what you go to do .
You go to do all the <unk> that <unk> .
It &apos;s going to do , and to do it , and I &apos;m going to be wondering , or even or having a <unk> experience with a <unk> experience , until you get to see that moment , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
I have to come up here . I &apos;m going to do now . And that was what I did .
<unk> years ago , a few years , you know , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I couldn &apos;t think that but for a long time I had to be there .
Now , in the last year , a student , a student who didn &apos;t have in your own class , which is to <unk> , &quot; &quot; You see , &quot; &quot; you see , &quot; &quot; you see , &quot; &quot; you see , &quot; &quot; you see , you have to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And she said to my <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> , said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to be here . &quot;
That was my moment .
Because we have two things .
The first one I said , I &apos;m <unk> ! I &apos;m not like this .
I don &apos;t know that , but she &apos;s yes , and he was going to be in the place .
The second one was , of course , to be here !
Come on , which can <unk> and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes , you need to be here ! &quot;
You &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> powerful , and you know what â€” ( Applause ) You &apos;re going to go , and you know what you &apos;re going to do the <unk> of all . &quot; &quot; And you know , the best speech , people , the people who have been in . ( Laughter )
And so that <unk> .
Now I want to tell you that there is no <unk> that I &apos;m going to do .
There are <unk> to live .
There are trying to do that the enough until they live and <unk> .
The last thing I &apos;m going to say is that .
<unk> changes you can see the big <unk> .
They &apos;re just two minutes .
Before we <unk> to the next <unk> , where you remember , for two minutes , <unk> that , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> the door .
This is what you have to do .
<unk> the brain to make the better that &apos;s better than this .
<unk> <unk> . He <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> that this <unk> like I don &apos;t think they are .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that this picture of what I &apos;m going to say who are , and I &apos;m going to show you .
I want to say before I had a different position of power , and I also want to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
And my kids is not about this . ( Laughter ) <unk> , <unk> people , because the best can use sound of those resources or technology , without <unk> and power .
<unk> with them , because they can do it in the sector .
We just need their body , in <unk> and two minutes to change the <unk> of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;m going to talk about is the problems of the big problems .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; â€” probably that it &apos;s also a good option .
( Laughter ) So what I &apos;m going to talk about what is the big problems in the world ?
And I &apos;m going to say , before <unk> , <unk> , each one of you that <unk> <unk> and paper because I &apos;m going to ask you to see what we do .
So they &apos;re <unk> and paper .
Well , they have a lot of that , there is a lot of problems in the world .
I &apos;m going to get some some .
There are millions of people in a year .
<unk> million people don &apos;t have access to the water .
Two billion without <unk> .
<unk> million people die , and AIDS .
<unk> .
Two billion people who will be <unk> to be <unk> by <unk> â€” and <unk> .
We have many , many problems .
There &apos;s a world , every <unk> all , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that they don &apos;t get all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do , the question that I think we might do â€” and that &apos;s the why we &apos;re doing â€” and that is the why we &apos;re on the <unk> of the economy â€” is to say , if we do it right ?
That &apos;s the question that I &apos;d like to do .
If you go to say , 50 billion <unk> to get in the next four years to improve this world , right ?
<unk> 10 of the most of the <unk> <unk> and just <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , education â€” <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> .
We think these , and we think the largest problems in the world .
So the question is , what you think are the biggest ?
Why do we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s what happens about a <unk> .
It &apos;s really , that was the <unk> of what she knew in <unk> in <unk> .
But <unk> , there is a problem , if you get to people who get us in the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve .
So the most of the problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to do that , we have ?
So the question is not enough , and they &apos;re <unk> the solutions .
And I would be â€” so that if you make a little bit more ?
For the <unk> <unk> , it would be something like <unk> .
To have <unk> , they could be available either , they should be available either .
For the <unk> , he would be the forces of <unk> , and so we can see .
What I was trying to do that , and I know that in 30 years â€” and I know that a few years â€” I know what you think are the <unk> <unk> .
And they also â€” on this is , of course , where the economy is if we don &apos;t want to do with the first place .
What should be the end of the <unk> ?
So , I &apos;m going to be a few years , perhaps <unk> with people , and just imagine what they should be <unk> , and just imagine what they have for the world .
What are the <unk> of this process â€” of course , I mean , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say â€” I &apos;m just 18 minutes of my time , not ?
And I would like to <unk> , and I think about this process , and that &apos;s what we did .
And also the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;m sure that you can &apos;t look at these <unk> , to think , as it is that we really really ?
So , there are that if we asked the one same , because they never never have to have a <unk> like this ?
And one reason is that the <unk> is <unk> .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all the organizations in the <unk> in the top of a <unk> .
But it has all the <unk> <unk> don &apos;t be in the poorest .
And because there are many more &quot; &quot; No <unk> , &quot; &quot; they got a <unk> , it &apos;s just not want to be a list like this .
There are 60 years ago , and it doesn &apos;t have to have the <unk> of the big things that we can do in the world , and say , what do we do first ?
That doesn &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not <unk> â€” every decision , is an <unk> , so that despite all the people we actually have to be able to <unk> , and that &apos;s not safe as good as we really did , and <unk> and <unk> that .
So what I &apos;m going to do is that we had , for a long period of time , a very long period of time , a situation in which nitric oxide .
There are many , many things that we can do out there , but we don &apos;t we do that , but we don &apos;t have the <unk> .
We didn &apos;t have a idea .
Imagine that you &apos;ve been in a restaurant , but you have an enormous enormous , but you know what &apos;s prices .
You know that you have <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know it .
It could be a <unk> , they could be $ 1,000 dollars .
Could it be a familiar to be a familiar , they might be an <unk> , right ?
<unk> to know these things .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do is to do the <unk> of <unk> â€” it &apos;s actually to put the prices of these issues .
And so , basically , this is the process of the <unk> <unk> .
So I was 30 of the best <unk> in the world , three of every area .
So what we took three of the best <unk> of the <unk> <unk> about <unk> .
What we can do ? What is the <unk> that we can do ?
The same <unk> diseases .
Three of the best <unk> , we can do ?
What is the price ?
What do we do about that , and what would happen ?
And so in front .
So we took some of the best best <unk> , eight from the best <unk> in the world , including three <unk> , <unk> <unk> in 2004 .
The call &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the economy .
It works that very well in Europe , but here we didn &apos;t see .
And , what they did , was to be a <unk> <unk> .
And then you <unk> , why did it ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy that I &apos;m going to tell that question â€” ( Laughter ) â€” because it &apos;s a good question .
The issue is that , obviously , obviously , if you want to know malaria , they ask me to a name about malaria .
If you want to know about the climate change , just the one <unk> .
But if you want to know what the two of two you might do first , you can &apos;t get the one of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
<unk> .
They have found that <unk> something <unk> , which we might do first , and what we might do after .
So this is the list , and this is the <unk> that you &apos;ve heard with you .
And so you can also see in the web , and I &apos;m true of that <unk> of this <unk> and day .
Basically , <unk> a <unk> in which they were <unk> projects projects â€” based on projects , projects where <unk> a <unk> , and you &apos;ve got less on a <unk> as a result .
And then they were the projects projects , the good teachers and the good teachers .
And of course , are the projects that we used to do .
So , I &apos;m going to start from the last last <unk> , which is going to start with the best projects .
These were bad .
You can see the end of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably probably one of the things that people think we don &apos;t know .
And I &apos;m going to talk about that , because it &apos;s really important .
Why did ?
And the truth , I was also <unk> to talk about this , because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we don &apos;t do with you .
The reason that he was saying that they said , &quot; &quot; or to do something more than you â€” not , or to do something more than <unk> â€” isn &apos;t a good amount of just because it &apos;s very <unk> .
It &apos;s not to say that there is not a chicken .
It &apos;s not say that &apos;s not a big problem .
But it is to say that what we can do why do is very little , the very small cost .
And what happens in the <unk> , the middle of all the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> , if the world was <unk> , <unk> about 150 billion deaths a year .
That &apos;s a important amount of money .
Two or three times the patient live in the development of every year .
And so to do very little .
We all the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> about six years on the <unk> .
So one of a kind of <unk> that he had been a <unk> in the <unk> , you can see it back .
What it &apos;s something like , but not very well .
So the idea , and say , well , <unk> a lot of money .
And just by start to take a baseline , which is that for half that amount of that amount , about 75 billion dollars per year , we can solve all the largest problems in the world .
<unk> <unk> water , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and education all the human beings .
So we might be <unk> , we want to focus on a little ?
Or a half , I &apos;ve learned a good ?
And that &apos;s where if it comes in a project .
It &apos;s not to say yes , all the money of the world , not the <unk> .
<unk> , that when we do not , just our first <unk> .
The projects of the projects â€” I &apos;m not going to say all of all â€” but <unk> <unk> , the scale of the world â€” which is by a little thing .
<unk> very well , but it also , but it also very <unk> .
One more , what we asked , and we decided to think about the two sides of the equation .
If you look at the same projects , they make a lot of projects projects .
One more , the <unk> and the water is <unk> , but it also costs a lot of <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four four <unk> that they should be , at least , the first <unk> that we used to talk about how we can change the problems of the world .
The one of the <unk> is malaria , <unk> malaria .
The <unk> of it â€” is about a couple million people in every year .
Could you even have a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
If you go about 13 billion dollars on the next four years , we can see the <unk> of half .
And we took death death , but what &apos;s perhaps is more important , we could create that billion , we could prevent a year .
<unk> <unk> your ability to do many of the other problems that they have .
The third one better is the same thing .
Basically , the model was that if you could look at the remote function , and especially <unk> the <unk> of the nation , and in Europe , we might have <unk> the economy in the <unk> of the year .
One more , we could do it to actually increase to 200 200 or 300 million people from poverty , <unk> and very quickly , between two and five years .
That would be the third better thing that we could do .
The second one thing would be <unk> in the <unk> .
They don &apos;t have to be in general , but a way , <unk> <unk> , is , the <unk> of <unk> .
Basically , half of the population of the world has <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and vitamin D <unk> .
If you <unk> 12 billion dollars , we could do a massive <unk> in this problem .
This is the second best <unk> that we could do .
And the best project would would be <unk> in HIV AIDS .
Basically , if we have 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could create <unk> millions of new patients in the 1980s .
Again , what this does is , what this does is and in what if we have <unk> is in fact that we have two forms of different patients as trying to learn AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is <unk> .
One more , in a world , <unk> the two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do any well , it might be very well , but at least , but where we &apos;re going to be first .
And the treatment is too , much more expensive than the <unk> .
So , I was <unk> , what this is going to say is that we can do much more in the <unk> .
Basically for the amount of money that we can do was to do it well , and 10 times more in <unk> .
So a more time , we should also <unk> more than in treatment , as the first option .
What it does is that really really is that really us to think of our <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to remember that you &apos;re going to be <unk> , and you say , <unk> ?
You know something like that we did ?
Well , <unk> , one of the things is going to be <unk> .
<unk> many people who think it &apos;s very , but that very little bit you that .
It also should be <unk> <unk> , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t know all the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I &apos;m going to tell you is that if we think about us in the problems , we &apos;re <unk> us more .
<unk> that we can do much more than a little bit .
And I think , the truth â€” Thomas <unk> , one of the monkey , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; <unk> very well .
One of the things that people <unk> , and that &apos;s in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about the most of the <unk> <unk> , the people will be very much more .
Even the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
It &apos;s a human person in the world in the development , it will be as rich as we &apos;re today .
And much more likely to do , they &apos;re the four times more <unk> than we are in .
And of course , we are even more rich than that .
But the question is , that when we speak to save people , people to help people in <unk> , not we &apos;re talking about a poor <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about a little bit .
And so the real thing , of course , that is , we want to get a lot of money to give you a little bit of money .
You want to help people on the poor , on those , we want to help people , on those , in that , in <unk> , who actually really help ?
Or as the <unk> said , imagine that <unk> â€” a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in thinking in 2005 , &quot; &quot; What is that you might have so much for you a little with this subject . &quot; &quot; So I think what we really do is that we need to put our lifestyle .
Even if you don &apos;t get to the way to see this problem .
And of course , that &apos;s awesome , because the <unk> <unk> has got a good story .
You know what we have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; â€” it seems to great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie , in the sense of that I want to see , but I don &apos;t believe that <unk> , and I don &apos;t believe that <unk> , and I don &apos;t believe that I &apos;m going to be <unk> in your movie . &quot;
So in many ways , I think the <unk> of <unk> and all the way about <unk> and all the one of the <unk> .
To do it &apos;s not just to do that it &apos;s not just to do it .
And it &apos;s not going to do the things that they have the biggest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to make in places where we can actually do a little bit .
The other insight , I think , what are important , is that we &apos;ve been some of some <unk> .
Of course , we might have to do everything , in a world , it would be completely .
I think we should do all the things , but we don &apos;t do it .
At the <unk> , the world has led to the current of what we did , right now , that in the countries in the countries .
How our help seem to get through half .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be that in the way of <unk> all the big problems .
What was the same way , the people would be , but there are the war of <unk> ?
You know , <unk> to be a billion million people . Why don &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m <unk> .
If some of you can talk to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But of course , the reason is to say , that if you go to other 100 billion dollars , it would be <unk> in the best way , it does ?
So the real problem , it is start to new and think they are the <unk> .
I mean I &apos;m going to be honest , is this really going to work ?
You know , when you go to the best <unk> in the world , <unk> <unk> by <unk> men and old in the United States .
And they don &apos;t have a great way to look at the world .
So we took 80 to 80 to the world to <unk> the same problem .
The <unk> <unk> were that they were on the <unk> of <unk> , and that <unk> English .
Most of them were , first , first , <unk> .
They have the same material , but they might be <unk> so much of the subject , as they really made , to put their own .
And the amazing thing was the <unk> was very similar <unk> â€” with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> at the end .
We have done that many other times .
And there are many other <unk> and <unk> students , and things .
We all had the same way .
And that &apos;s a great hope , really , really , to tell you that I think there is a way to tell you that think of our <unk> . &quot; &quot; And say , that &apos;s the most important of the world ?
Of course , in a world , we get to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do everything , we can start to think about where they <unk> ?
I see the <unk> <unk> as a process .
So we did in 2004 , and we decided to give a lot more people , to get a better information in 2008 , <unk> .
And we also start to the way to the world , but also start to think about <unk> policy .
To start to think , &quot; &quot; We do we do the things that we can put up with a <unk> <unk> , and the things we don &apos;t know how to do , but we do not know what do we do .
If you look at a lot of some things , we &apos;re <unk> by <unk> by some other things .
So I hope this in the <unk> , better , and think about the best to the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I was going to go home home .
He said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I had to go home to the house , and the other side of the city <unk> , and that &apos;s very cold .
And I was in <unk> , so you can &apos;t see it , so you didn &apos;t know that I don &apos;t have the difficult .
In fact , if you could see the window of the table , where the <unk> .
But they were all <unk> .
I wasn &apos;t supposed to night at the home of my friend , because the morning , he had been a microphone , and I was going to go down and <unk> .
So , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> of the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> into the window of <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
They have a lot of money but they didn &apos;t think a <unk> in the environment .
Well , I &apos;m going to show you up to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> under the levels of <unk> .
So , at the morning , when I grew up after a little bit , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> that he had to have in Europe in Europe , and the <unk> that he had to have in Europe in Europe .
And to get to the <unk> of the <unk> , I didn &apos;t realize that <unk> .
So I went to the home , with snow and ice , and ice , and ice , in 40 minutes , I went down to <unk> , and I got my <unk> to another person .
Or , in the case they &apos;re <unk> things .
And he &apos;s going to tell you , and it &apos;s going to tell me , and he &apos;s going to show you .
It was something that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> about that there was a few years ago , and he was also <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a team of <unk> that we can determine what happened , right ?
Well , in the <unk> , as she explained this , and he explained you to determine what you can do do to do .
What I want to talk today is what we can do today .
One things are <unk> , other things are <unk> .
I &apos;m going to start to start by <unk> .
<unk> places for all the house for the things that they marketed them .
Well , that seems to be a common , and it &apos;s like this sense .
There is a structure of the brain , which is the hippocampus that evolved through hundreds of years to remember the location of things .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain is to the brain of the brain is to the hippocampus of the brain .
It &apos;s part of the brain in the brain .
In fact , there is my experiment to did the experiment to <unk> sense of the <unk> .
But it works well with things that you don &apos;t have to be too too , and they don &apos;t get things that <unk> .
So there are a place for your keys .
For the <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in a room , on the table .
If you go into a place and if it &apos;s <unk> the things going to be in your place when the <unk> .
And when he <unk> ? <unk> a picture with a seat .
And I took a email with the picture to <unk> to see it .
These things are <unk> .
You see that when we &apos;re using stress , the brain <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> and <unk> the mind .
It turns out that you can &apos;t be able to do the best of you , and that you should be a better system .
So when you look at a decision .
And we all have in a situation at this situation , at a situation at a situation .
And about that I want to talk .
You know , or any matter what we do do to do .
And they go to the doctor , and that says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the test , and it &apos;s also a bit .
You know what they are .
And they put in thinking that they have the pain is not very good . &quot; &quot; And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a drug , but the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a drug , you don &apos;t know that they &apos;re one of the drugs that are you <unk> and know what are one of the drugs .
<unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
It is the number of <unk> and <unk> , and what is the <unk> ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to be able to be able to be able to be a person , before I &apos;m going to get a person .
And they said , &quot; &quot; What is that ?
The number he should be a <unk> , my physician don &apos;t want to be something that you don &apos;t have . &quot;
But the result of this .
We don &apos;t know it well .
<unk> estimates that 90 percent of the drugs that has among 90 percent , and 50 percent of us .
So the <unk> in the case of the <unk> <unk> what you think about it ?
How many people have to say before somebody ?
This is the results of the results ?
And the same <unk> data .
And he <unk> <unk> .
Instead of this .
And the <unk> things . <unk> <unk> in front of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> â€” But <unk> , &quot; &quot; A five percent . I don &apos;t believe that .
You have 15 times more effective than the drug you have to do .
I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re <unk> <unk> or not not saying , or not just <unk> .
You just have to have this conversation with your physician .
You have to have to have a information to have this information to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to
I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> for cancer , <unk> is <unk> .
Yes , there are <unk> <unk> by every person that you live .
And the side effects in this <unk> at 50 percent of patients .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , the idea of the <unk> <unk> , and the conversation is to the conversation of the conversation .
What is not to have to create all that at the time .
There are more than thinking about how the quality of life .
They are things on what we should think now , and we &apos;re thinking about now and <unk> .
You know , if you look at the brain <unk> , and one of the things that happened in that moment is that if you get a lot of systems .
So evolution did .
And if you look at the body , because the body <unk> in these things , and we don &apos;t have to be able to <unk> them in these things , and we don &apos;t have to be able to <unk> them in these things , and we don &apos;t have to be able to <unk> them in these things , and we don &apos;t have to be able to <unk> them in these things , and we don &apos;t have to be able to <unk> them in these things , and we don &apos;t have to be able
<unk> , one of the things that if you &apos;ve been <unk> , and one of the things that I &apos;m going to have to be <unk> , and their colleagues .
And so we need to be <unk> to think of this kind of <unk> .
I think the most important thing is they recognize that we all have <unk> .
So let &apos;s go back .
The idea is to think they can be <unk> in what they can be these <unk> , <unk> systems that can <unk> the <unk> or just realized that things bad <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to remember that night with me on <unk> . &quot; &quot; When I went on the <unk> , with the front of the home , and an <unk> <unk> to remember .
They are not entirely <unk> .
<unk> day .
They are <unk> ?
Why ? No . Well , it &apos;s nothing .
&quot; &quot; <unk> , please ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Are you , <unk> of this ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
It seemed like to have to speak with me .
We just a word that a young word was a <unk> <unk> .
How can do that ?
And I started thinking about .
And they &apos;re very much .
How is what we did ?
This same time for that moment .
<unk> , but for all of the people .
You know , or <unk> in <unk> , and he <unk> in the job . It &apos;s not a language that we have done .
But we have the other important important important , but we have the other important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important important , but we have one more important important , but
And there are some <unk> that <unk> that to <unk> each other languages .
I began to write back in Arabic , and he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he began to write in Arabic , and he began
And all of the ideas , their ideas , their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and with <unk> ideas .
And when he started to school in English English , when he started to school in English English , when he started to school in English English , when he started to school in English English , when he started to school in English English , when he started to write in English English .
They took their job in English , when he <unk> their school
We can think that &apos;s the same person person .
The second place , it is , it is to put their language .
This is actually <unk> the societies .
<unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And that was advanced enough to us , but I &apos;m going to make that world , but I &apos;m going to make that world .
And so in order to make that world developed the universe , <unk> and others , that <unk> <unk> their language to the time that <unk> , <unk> as a <unk> .
They were <unk> to his point .
Because if we take any of the <unk> <unk> , we know that it &apos;s not a <unk> .
There is a <unk> that was a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be consumers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
There are a little bit different .
The language is not one , two or three words or <unk> <unk> in Ivory Coast .
Or , or if you had a child <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
How about it ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better that <unk> and realized to speak .
What I mean , is that these <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
I have a friend who <unk> <unk> with a <unk> .
A time I asked them to be all .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s very well , but a time I met night at the night and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
It &apos;s not that she &apos;s not who who &apos;s his husband &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s normal that he &apos;s not <unk> ; their way to think of it is different .
She said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> me with me , &quot; &quot; and a night , <unk> <unk> to me to me , &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> this , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> this , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> this : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; this : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; this : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; this : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; this : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> this , &quot; &quot; â€” ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; <unk>
( Applause ) Well , what we did to protect the language in Arabic ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> to society , <unk> <unk> <unk> to society , <unk> <unk> <unk> to society , <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to society .
Even a lot of people who said , &quot; &quot; Why do you ?
<unk> that , and I &apos;m going to do you . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s problem .
In the <unk> to <unk> the following &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Is no ! &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be this , or this ! &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be that because of that way you don &apos;t get up .
And when I &apos;m going to tell you that , &quot; &quot; Arabic .
<unk> â€” ( Applause ) <unk> that we want to change our reality , and to be <unk> in a way that <unk> our <unk> and day day .
So , I &apos;m going to tell you about how to us and <unk> as we think .
And after that <unk> pictures of these guys and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
They <unk> people , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in English .
We are very <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
And what he says , &quot; &quot; Hey , <unk> a word on English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to ask you to say , &quot; &quot; Internet .
Or , or the people think they think of us , in what we think of all the language , in which they will increase the language .
The creativity in language is the way .
<unk> from the same .
One single one , it could be a number of one could it could be global .
It could be <unk> again again .
But we have to know , and I &apos;m going to be sure that there is a solution that , and it will be <unk> that we have <unk> of part of it .
In short , what you can do with you now ?
Let &apos;s look at it , who &apos;s <unk> ?
Please , I know , even my time , I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
But we don &apos;t say in Arabic , <unk> <unk> <unk> with numbers .
( Applause ) This is a <unk> ! It &apos;s not a language !
And I &apos;m going to show you in a living world in a language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back and <unk> that world .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
<unk> are first to the father in the father .
So when my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; .
What &apos;s happening in the mind of this ?
If you look at that there &apos;s 30 years , most people , <unk> , say that this baby baby is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> â€” that you can &apos;t see a <unk> process .
In the last 20 years , the science is in the development of <unk> .
In the way , we believe that this baby baby is like the thought of the most <unk> of a <unk> .
<unk> one example of this .
One thing I could be to think of this baby , which could be to think of this baby , which could be going to be in the mind of his mind .
For the end , and the <unk> , one of the most good things to all of us is to all people think and they think .
And perhaps more to understand what the other ones think they think , and they think it &apos;s not the same thing that we think and it works .
And in the politics , you have to see the power of the policy can say the hard to do this , some people .
We decided to know if they were children and kids could have been able to understand this idea about other people .
The question is : how we can do ?
<unk> don &apos;t speak , and if you give them to a child , that we think , just was just a series of three years that we think , just was just a massive signal about it , and things like that .
How can we go ?
It turns out , what the <unk> was .
<unk> <unk> , one of my students , and I , and I &apos;m going to have two two <unk> with food : one with you <unk> , and another with <unk> <unk> .
Well , all the babies , even in <unk> , they are <unk> <unk> , and they don &apos;t want to see the <unk> .
( Laughter ) And then , what was doing was to do the two of two two <unk> .
And they said that they decided to do or not what they do .
A half of the time , I was doing the <unk> <unk> , and you don &apos;t see it â€” like any baby or human mind .
But the other half , I had a little bit of you , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , you see .
You know what you can see . <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; That is , they said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
We did this with a few years ago .
And then <unk> the hand to hand , &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot;
The one thing was , they &apos;re <unk> the teachers who would take them to each other or her ?
And the amazing thing was the <unk> of 18 months , which is the start to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> if you <unk> the <unk> and you can see what you can see .
For another side , the few years of 15 months <unk> <unk> to him if you were <unk> , like you can &apos;t see it , like you can &apos;t see that .
And after <unk> for a mouse , <unk> <unk> , what was going to remember the world .
So there are two data on this .
For the side of the months , they have been <unk> this from the human nature : that we don &apos;t know the same thing .
It &apos;s more likely to change to help people to help other people to get what <unk> .
And more interesting to the economy , it is that the babies have 15 months to do this â€” what suggests that the children in 18 months , and the <unk> of 15 months .
And so they are more likely to get more than the most of the <unk> .
And this is only one of the hundreds of studies that have been in the last 20 years ago .
What if you can ask now is , Why is what children are so much ?
And as it possible that you can learn that in the time ?
It &apos;s say , the first hand , they seem to do .
And in a lot , they &apos;re worse , because we have to use a long time and energy just in order .
If we <unk> to the evolution of evolution to look at the embryo condition that we &apos;ve made so long time , it turns out that there is a response to answer .
If you look at a different species , not only other <unk> like us , but also of others <unk> , birds even like the <unk> or the <unk> , it turns out that there is relationship between the <unk> or the <unk> , it &apos;s the size of the brain and the size of the brain and the size of the brain and the <unk> of a species .
A example of this <unk> of these birds to see here .
For the one of the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are birds very strong .
Instead of those things are so smart as <unk> .
And this is a very <unk> , that has to use tools to use tools to use food .
For the other side , we have our <unk> <unk> .
Women , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , are <unk> .
I &apos;m very good <unk> , but you &apos;re not really good , but they &apos;re not really good at anything anything .
It turns out , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And so they &apos;re looking at the worms at the normal worms for the normal worms for two years .
However , African-Americans are <unk> in a couple of months .
And so that is the reason why we do do in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
There are something in the <unk> that seems to be associated with the knowledge and learning .
What we could have to do this ?
Some animals , like the income , they seem to do a very good thing .
So the governments are very good <unk> in a <unk> environment .
Other creatures , like <unk> , I &apos;m not interested with anything doing anything , but they &apos;re very good learning .
And of course , we &apos;re humans , we are very far at that .
We have to be more great to our body , much more than any animal animal .
<unk> , more <unk> , we can learn more , we can learn but we can do on the planet , and even the space .
And our kids , and kids are together , for much more time than the lives of others .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So at least 23 , we know the <unk> <unk> <unk> in their mouths .
Very good , why we look at this journey ?
One idea is that the strategy , the learning of learning , is a very powerful way , and <unk> <unk> in this world .
And it turns out that to be if it works , if it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to be a good <unk> , and he would be thinking , &quot; &quot; <unk> a <unk> or a <unk> ? What will be better ? &quot;
That would be better , it might be better to know that before the <unk> <unk> .
And the way that happened this problem was , it seems to be , with a job <unk> .
So we have this period of time in which we &apos;re absolutely <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . We should learn .
And then , adults , we can take that that we have learned , and kids , and that we have to test the world .
One way to think of this is that children , and kids are like the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of a human species .
They &apos;re the people who <unk> , which they just go to learn and to have good ideas , learn and to have the production .
We have to take all those ideas that we &apos;ve learned children and <unk> .
Another way of that is , instead of think , and kids like adults , think of them in them and kids like adults , think of them in such as a state of development in a different way .
If that &apos;s true , if they are interested in learning , and that &apos;s history of evolution in that , what the children are to learn , we can learn that they &apos;re going to learn that you can be a lot .
And in fact , the brain is to be the computer computer , the computer , the computer .
They still have the computers they get to improve a lot .
It &apos;s going to be a revolution in our way to understand the machines of learning .
And all the causes of the ideas of this man , the <unk> Thomas <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Basically , <unk> <unk> a <unk> system that I &apos;m going to tell you from the probability to <unk> and describe the way that the scientists are <unk> in the world .
What the scientists do is to <unk> a <unk> , something that we can start .
And then I &apos;m going to be that with a test .
The Turing test <unk> to change .
And they are the <unk> with new test , and so <unk> .
What he was found was a <unk> <unk> that could do that .
And the mathematics are the basis of the best programs and we have today today .
There are 10 years ago , they have a lot to do the same thing .
If we want to know what &apos;s happening under these <unk> <unk> , I think it &apos;s something very similar like that .
And on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And I think the ones are trying to do with the very <unk> <unk> that <unk> and like the world .
Well , that &apos;s even more learning .
If you look at the adult adult , you can feel quite a <unk> .
How do we do that children ?
To test this , we did a machine that we used to call the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a toolbox that if they were <unk> and they &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> .
By using this machine , in my lab , and you can see , if you look at the lab , and they also help , if I &apos;m going to show you in some of <unk> in the world .
It just just one we did with <unk> , one of my students .
If you look at this app probably <unk> by thinking that the way of <unk> is a <unk> <unk> about the garden .
But the case is that the normal works was a very strange strange .
If you look at one <unk> , something that you can &apos;t put in a little bit , which is not going to be in a little bit , the risk of three times .
You know that if you look at the <unk> , which would be the <unk> , only the <unk> , only the two time .
So , if you think about it has the more <unk> <unk> .
It looks like the strategy to <unk> the object , but it &apos;s probably the other .
So let &apos;s take these data to the children of four years and <unk> that .
And with security , the children &apos;s four years , the data , and the object the object .
There are two data in this fact .
And the first one , I was children that are children in four years .
And they are learning to tell us .
But the <unk> is to make the current points that they have to make a measure of what they needed to do .
The second thing is that they are doing using the test for order to get a idea , to a sense of the world , which seems to be a little bit .
So in what we do , in the lab , some different types of these children are better , we &apos;ve found that these children &apos;s four years are better than adults than adults .
You know , kids , kids , kids make a lot about <unk> things about the world . But the scientific scientists , then , after all , and we can see if children would happen .
It &apos;s what we call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
We took one of the laboratory in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> again .
It &apos;s children that the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the red triangles , and the red triangles are not , as a <unk> .
What you &apos;re looking at now is the guy <unk> <unk> in five minutes .
Anderson : And so ?
Video : You see the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first <unk> <unk> .
Video : Ah , ( Laughter ) No , but this isn &apos;t .
<unk> : And they start to describe the <unk> .
Oh : Why do that if you look ?
( Laughter ) Child : You don &apos;t understand .
<unk> : Secrets recognize that the face of <unk> .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be so , and this has to be like that .
<unk> : <unk> , we know .
Video : So he &apos;s being .
Video : Oh , you cannot be .
( Laughter ) <unk> : Now that &apos;s next idea .
It &apos;s <unk> to <unk> that <unk> on the other .
And they didn &apos;t work .
CK : Oh , it &apos;s because the light will just go up here , right here .
I &apos;m going to tell you this box , but this isn &apos;t it .
<unk> : Well , that would happen .
<unk> : Now if you go .
If you go four <unk> .
If you look at four <unk> in this , <unk> and two for them to get the other .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s <unk> .
This child is â€” is a child , a kid , but he <unk> it , but he had found that it &apos;s a kid .
If you look at the way , if you look at the children , if you ask them to be something , what they do is .
All of the children &apos;s four years .
Well , what if you do that kind of <unk> ?
What if you look at a <unk> of these <unk> that you can do in five hypotheses for two minutes ?
If we go back and <unk> , many , and they say , many , they do not the sound , or even what they are , or even what they are .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think the children , children are more than the adults .
This is what we know about how works as it works .
The importance of the human , and attention of a human adult .
What &apos;s happening in adults is that when something we decided that something really important or relevant , <unk> attention .
This is about that we can go to be <unk> , and it turns out that the same almost almost <unk> .
We also know how happens to the brain .
So when you look at something , the part of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the action , <unk> that a little part of the brain if they <unk> , if you look more <unk> , better , better to learn , better to learn .
We have so a little bit very <unk> , <unk> .
If you look at the children , you see something very different .
I think the children , and kids have to have a more more <unk> than a <unk> than the one of you .
<unk> <unk> , and the kids would have a lot of <unk> to one thing .
But it was very good way to do a lot of a information to the time .
And if we look at their brains , what we see is that they see that they are <unk> to learning , and to <unk> , and that the <unk> is not going to be done .
For that when we say that kids , and kids have problems to do attention , what really means is that you don &apos;t do .
<unk> <unk> of the things that they were trying to say something by just look at something that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of human , the kind of poem we &apos;ve learned of those <unk> that are <unk> to learn .
If we want to think of a way that kind of human diversity as adults , I think the best way is to think about we &apos;re able to be able to think of somebody in what we &apos;re looking at , or when we &apos;re going to have a city for first .
And we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> , but what &apos;s happening , but it seems to be that in three days in the <unk> , there is more than in three days in the home , and I &apos;m talking about how to do .
For the way , that <unk> <unk> that we take down , actually <unk> the effect of <unk> .
So how is to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like to be <unk> , in Paris , for the first time , after <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) I want to make a wonderful , but that <unk> <unk> to the three morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s good enough .
I don &apos;t want to say too too much about the <unk> that they are .
It &apos;s okay .
We can do things like <unk> or fuel <unk> .
And he has a sense that makes a long effort to do they think the adults .
But if what we want to do is to be like these <unk> , we have the mind open , to be able to learning , imagination , tissue , innovation , perhaps , maybe , at least the time , I &apos;m going to do that the adults think of a little bit like children .
( Applause )
And these are exciting , simple , you know , <unk> , you have <unk> .
They are the things that the victims of the genocide is <unk> .
We &apos;re all <unk> these <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
The fact that some <unk> victims , <unk> as the <unk> or <unk> <unk> of teeth is a signal that he was <unk> .
And let me tell you that he would be <unk> .
And these <unk> <unk> <unk> to me from my land , and we &apos;re going to talk about the <unk> of the new <unk> <unk> that if they were 20 years after the war .
And they are maybe the biggest <unk> .
For the four years of the conflict that <unk> <unk> the first of the 90 , some <unk> citizens , <unk> the majority of people , and they might be <unk> for the speech .
The more <unk> were killed , right in the first days of the war , or well , the end of the conflict .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> by humanity and genocide genocide .
It is the destruction <unk> and <unk> of a group of <unk> , political , <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> is so <unk> .
And as the destruction <unk> , which is the destruction <unk> , and basically of a signal signal from their existence .
The genocide isn &apos;t just the <unk> ; it is the Kingdom of the identity of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the identity , the genocide is not only .
There is no choice , there is no <unk> <unk> .
They always always <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> more than his <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
And these <unk> <unk> of a lot of <unk> and the goal of the <unk> of <unk> , is an <unk> process of the <unk> that they &apos;re looking at at the first of the <unk> that they &apos;re looking at the first of the <unk> of the <unk> .
No <unk> should be able to do it or without <unk> <unk> .
One time if you look at these <unk> objects that the victims of the way to his <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of them in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> as you see in <unk> <unk> plastic .
<unk> like the tools of the <unk> visual <unk> , but also as a test <unk> in the war of war .
Sometimes it &apos;s called the <unk> to <unk> themselves , but the visual technologies is a difficult to be <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Once you <unk> , doctors , doctors and <unk> on them to be <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
A lot of <unk> , even though they don &apos;t know what or just <unk> out of the world and the mind of the mind and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the
There are a few years ago I decided to each other , and I decided to create a simple simple <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> <unk> .
And in this case , you can recognize it can recognize the objects , or less than the photos the photos like the field , <unk> and <unk> what happened .
The picture is empathy and the <unk> of these <unk> objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a <unk> , if you want , and the result is the most of the same possible as a <unk> <unk> .
When they go to the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And in all of his <unk> that are the <unk> for the identity of the last <unk> , the last <unk> that those people have been <unk> .
Thank you very much .

There are a few years ago , I decided to go through the great philosopher , <unk> <unk> .
There are some things that I learned with these days of 30 days .
And the course of the months , we didn &apos;t have <unk> <unk> , if you don &apos;t think the time was much more than .
And that &apos;s <unk> to my class , a picture of a month .
You would never have to be so so <unk> .
And I also understood that I went to the last <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the last <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the last <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the last <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the last <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the last <unk> I also went to the <unk> I also went to the
For the way , the secret is in not to do .
But I &apos;m going to be a lot of one .
It &apos;s terrible .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I am <unk> . &quot;
You don &apos;t . If I want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
And I &apos;m going to do you that to do change in <unk> , and <unk> , and that &apos;s more likely to do the <unk> to always .
In fact , they are <unk> .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to share my &quot; &quot; <unk> .
This is a picture ?
Because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t buy their cameras .
With all , my grandparents began to me when I was my <unk> camera on the 15 years .
<unk> with my passion , but it was a different bit different , but it was a different different , because you can see the camera in the process .
And when you got a picture of a camera , the process <unk> when they <unk> the <unk> .
For me a photograph , I was more than to be in the place , in the time .
<unk> that anything could do .
And so I wanted to create something different , something where the process <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> like this : a bottle of a very <unk> .
But it has a <unk> <unk> .
And , for that , using this level of <unk> .
Or pictures like this â€” and we &apos;ve got to it again , but with all the waste of the <unk> to maintain the level of <unk> .
When I say I &apos;m <unk> .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that I can &apos;t think but but I always want you to think that was happened as a picture .
<unk> on the way that you have to think for a moment to find the trick .
So this is more than to do with a idea that with a moment really .
But what is what the does seem seem to do ?
You have to see with the details , you have to see with the details ?
You have to see with the light ?
What is what is happening ?
The other <unk> is the illusion .
But at the end of the end , the world is in the world and as it can be <unk> on the surface .
It &apos;s really not about if it &apos;s <unk> , but what we think is <unk> .
And so I think those are very simple .
I &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> of reality that we take different bits of reality and their joy to create an reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three objects , is perfectly <unk> , something that we all can live with a three-dimensional world .
But he had to be true , can create something that even still seem as well as well as well .
But , at the same time , we know that it can &apos;t exist .
So , I took our brain to brain because the brain is just not that the fact that really doesn &apos;t have work .
And I see the same process of the <unk> .
It turns out in <unk> different .
So the things that they do that a picture is <unk> , I think they are those in which we don &apos;t even think , the things that we don &apos;t do .
But when you go pictures , it &apos;s really important to do that . Because what &apos;s really important to do .
And so I &apos;d like to say that there is three enough to come to be <unk> results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But <unk> , they can create something like that .
So the first <unk> is that the photos have been to have the same perspective .
Second , the photos have to have the same kinds of light .
And these two images came with with these <unk> , they were <unk> to the same <unk> , and with the same sort of light .
The third point is to do a <unk> <unk> where they start and do the different images with a <unk> <unk> .
It has to be impossible to say as if we were <unk> to image .
<unk> <unk> the color , the contrast , and the <unk> of the <unk> that there are between different images , <unk> <unk> like the United States , <unk> <unk> , and noise , and noise , <unk> , <unk> between the different images and we do that it &apos;s a single image , and we do that this is a really really can have hundreds of them .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) It could <unk> that this is the image of a landscape , and the <unk> is what was <unk> .
But this picture is , it &apos;s also about the pictures of different places .
I think it &apos;s more easy to create a place that <unk> , because one isn &apos;t the ideas that have in the head .
But that &apos;s a lot of other .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , I knew that I had a few months to <unk> , to find your attention , to find your attention .
For example , the fish was written in a window .
<unk> are a different range .
The part of it was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And yes , even the <unk> of the island of the island of the island to <unk> .
So to look at a result , I believe that we do with each other .
It always always have a <unk> , a idea .
And there are that <unk> different .
And there are every piece of <unk> .
If you have a good job to take the photos to take the photos can be very beautiful , and at it .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that we &apos;re looking at is our imagination .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In this slide , they have to look at their age in the <unk> .
And after you , <unk> from the map .
And they &apos;re going to be able to use all the world .
And the <unk> of the <unk> is entirely different .
We change our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
We had to make a group of control .
But we have to <unk> that a few years ago .
And another group that have been just the one of the <unk> <unk> , and another group that had just been the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and another group that had just been the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What you see here is the result of the <unk> .
He has a couple months .
( Laughter ) <unk> different in the brain â€” ( Laughter ) they do that one of the other <unk> in the brain .
