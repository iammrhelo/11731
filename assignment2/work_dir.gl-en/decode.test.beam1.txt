It was a <unk> of 2005 .
<unk> of the context of the <unk> , the European Union <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you my job , but it <unk> that day , <unk> a little bit <unk> .
So I was going to go back to my head , Chris .
Now , Chris &apos;s a more about 30 years in the <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> that the institutions of the institutions .
And I told you that I &apos;m going to be a little bit <unk> .
And I was a series of you , I was a series of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> : very interesting .
But I wanted to get to <unk> these problems .
Chris was going to be a big , and what &apos;s called the <unk> of these , which are the five of the five things you &apos;ve been <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And they are the <unk> that you can &apos;t get ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , the <unk> of the <unk> , the technologies <unk> , the <unk> and ...
<unk> , there is a great thing , the <unk> of the <unk> as <unk> <unk> and ...
Of course , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; Yes , that &apos;s mostly of genes , &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; .
&quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> , the government <unk> in the body of the body , the human body ?
You cannot get to be a &quot; &quot; <unk> to my <unk> and <unk> to the Chris three of <unk> .
And 20 minutes later , he was <unk> , <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Oh ! &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be <unk> ? &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s Chris , a big <unk> , but I didn &apos;t know about anything about the whole of <unk> , and he &apos;s nothing about genetic .
I know something about genetic , but it was not <unk> , much less <unk> of <unk> .
And so there was much much more than they were before before I was to learn before .
First , we had to know what if you were going to be when somebody was going to be when somebody was just to get an gene .
The <unk> genetic <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the more <unk> of all are the called &quot; &quot; DNA , &quot; &quot; or a piece of DNA , &quot; &quot; or your <unk> &quot; &quot; or your <unk> &quot; or your <unk> &quot; or your <unk> &quot; or your <unk> &quot; or your <unk> &quot; or your <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> of this : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t see the genes of your body , you &apos;re <unk> the genes , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s true , but the problem is <unk> in which is you need to be <unk> for them .
And the <unk> not just a <unk> gene in particular , but all the same important that gene was .
And what does that ?
Well , you can &apos;t see your genes , a physician and <unk> that the <unk> , to see if you look at the <unk> of the bed in the winter .
And they also have <unk> that the <unk> of the bed , so that gene was actually <unk> in a lot of medical or a medical cell .
And we were <unk> that these <unk> , the six companies , <unk> in the human genome was the <unk> to the patients .
We have <unk> , a little bit about the years with the <unk> of the <unk> , a disease , a disease that , if it &apos;s not , can , it can be <unk> .
The company that I &apos;ve been learned the two genes , they have to take a test for plastic .
But then he went into <unk> and never the <unk> <unk> .
But the company that I was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to him .
And two years without to do the test .
For that time , I was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> genetic change were a problem that we can do patients .
What do we have a little way in the front of the front ?
Well , it turns out that the <unk> <unk> was in a long <unk> , <unk> , which is a series of things that are not <unk> .
You cannot &apos;t get products of the nature : air , the water , the elements of the <unk> , the elements of the <unk> , the elements of the <unk> , and the elements of the <unk> , the elements of the <unk> .
And they don &apos;t even the laws of nature : the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re very important , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit of all , and they &apos;re going to be able to be a little bit of the other , and they &apos;re going to be a <unk> of all , are very <unk> .
Our opinion for DNA , the structure of life , the structure of life , that encode the production of all our proteins , is so a different of the nature of the nature , <unk> of that if we &apos;re <unk> in our bodies or the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of that <unk> in our bodies or the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of that <unk> in our bodies or the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of that <unk> in our bodies or the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of that <unk> in
For the best , we put by all the country , <unk> for a country , and <unk> doctors , and I <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Most of the <unk> we had to have since a number of political policy , and when less on Goliath , from a point of view , from the legal .
They all know that the cause of us go to go with our <unk> in this subject were so .
But why ?
It &apos;s <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> , <unk> these <unk> , more 20 years .
<unk> , there was thousands of <unk> in a human , there was thousands of <unk> in a lot of high school , there was thousands of <unk> in a lot of high school , there was thousands of <unk> in a lot of high school , there was thousands of <unk> in a lot of high school , there was thousands of <unk> in a lot of high school , there was thousands of <unk> in a lot of high school , there was thousands of <unk> in a lot of high school , there was thousands of
The <unk> of <unk> was very <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the U.K. <unk> , and the whole <unk> of this <unk> <unk> — a <unk> , without no we &apos;ve been done the <unk> of <unk> <unk> year after a year , without no we &apos;ve been seen the <unk> of <unk> <unk> year after a year , without no we &apos;ve been seen the <unk> of <unk> <unk> year after a year , without no we &apos;ve been seen the <unk> of <unk> <unk> year after a year , without no we &apos;ve been seen the
Briefly : <unk> not to be <unk> to <unk> these <unk> , so <unk> .
But , and they can &apos;t go and me , and I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> and that we &apos;re <unk> , &quot; &quot; We have to have no &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
So we started to our cause .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . That &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> and so that <unk> , dark , dark , dark , dark , dark .
The reason we don &apos;t have to be that kind of causes , we think our cause more much more than .
It &apos;s just like a scientific , and the rich or physician .
So we decided to take a cause that would not be as the <unk> that there are <unk> , but an causes the <unk> of <unk> .
They have to identify a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he had been <unk> their own bed for then <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to <unk> as these <unk> <unk> in <unk> patients and innovation .
I &apos;m going to tell you that the Koran knew for <unk> was <unk> , a company with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> of two genes , the genes <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> that are more likely more than the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the United States .
He was that a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they were a lot of money on their test : I &apos;ve got a couple of money .
I &apos;m going to share your data to the political community , the community , the international community .
And , if it &apos;s the worst of all , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> his <unk> to his test for that <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> by a team of nitric oxide .
And so I &apos;m going to be that for that time , for a few years , to get a 12 percent of the women who were doing the <unk> of a single <unk> response : a result of what should be <unk> .
This is <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> cancer , and he did the <unk> <unk> .
The test it has to come from .
The family <unk> .
The more likely to was that cancer , not in the family , which the other <unk> of the family don &apos;t make the test .
But two years later , the <unk> <unk> a number of <unk> in the advanced pyramid .
It has been <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> that 12 percent of people who had to give a result of <unk> .
If you look at the result , we would have a test , <unk> would be the test , and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And they could be <unk> these problems .
So we have a <unk> , in fact , in Western pocket , four organizations than in the <unk> , the <unk> organizations in Europe , and women and women who are like , well , well , or a second point that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , or a medical <unk> , and women are <unk> that or well , well , or a second point that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , or a medical <unk> , and
One of the largest challenges that I &apos;ve learned that , was to think the way that I think of science .
For my <unk> that I was doing was a <unk> , and that the genes would be was a <unk> , and that genes , and they were <unk> to <unk> the products , we had to make a sense ? What ?
How can do if the DNA , and why is not a <unk> ?
We spend hours hours for hours hours with our <unk> and <unk> our <unk> , trying to make the way of the <unk> of the way we <unk> .
And at the end , by the end , by the end of the <unk> , as the gold .
So you &apos;re <unk> DNA , like <unk> or a <unk> or the <unk> of a <unk> .
You can see the process of the process to do anything , but you can &apos;t make your own own gold .
It has the job if you were trying to communicate the gold feel <unk> ; you can &apos;t see it , it &apos;s probably gold .
And the gold , a <unk> , you can do in all sorts of things in the <unk> that you can &apos;t use when he was in the mountain ; with it <unk> to make <unk> , for example , but it can &apos;t feel the gold , because it &apos;s effective .
In 2009 , we were ready to be the case .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> Robert <unk> .
As a plank of 2010 , the <unk> <unk> his <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . A <unk> of us .
When you look at their opinion , we <unk> the <unk> with the science in the case .
I mean , our mathematics — was a good , but not as good .
How could have to develop a knowledge of the <unk> that <unk> to be so little , while ?
We can &apos;t think how they could do something like that .
So she was <unk> that the <unk> was made by the British <unk> , not only was <unk> — was a scientist .
And not only was , he was a <unk> in biology biology .
( Laughter ) <unk> .
So he took him to expand the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And here &apos;s the things that do interesting stuff .
First , in a moment , the government in the United States of the U.S.
In the <unk> of <unk> , the government <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
But in <unk> <unk> to his own office , the government <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> that he had been <unk> this <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , and he <unk> the DNA <unk> not to be <unk> .
This was very important , and it &apos;s also a lot .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , all of the <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s called his <unk> <unk> , very <unk> of the <unk> .
So even with this , <unk> , <unk> with me .
And so it was .
Rather , or less .
The decision was to have two .
But the two <unk> that you &apos;ve learned on , did , did it &apos;s entirely different .
The first one , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> their own and new theory , are so that .
( Laughter )
We &apos;ve been <unk> to that , so I didn &apos;t have a sense .
The other monkey , the <unk> <unk> , he said that <unk> with us , which is the DNA will be <unk> with a <unk> of nature .
But what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot; &quot; The third one , the <unk> , the reason .
You have to make a question that you might have to <unk> the <unk> .
And they &apos;re going to be , these questions will be the way of a <unk> <unk> , a lot of a month with lots of <unk> , &quot; &quot; where you might say &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
We did that if they were the question , the more thing we &apos;ve ever seen .
<unk> words are <unk> the genes ?
When Chris Anderson knew what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well I don &apos;t know .
I think I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; is the DNA <unk> ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want to <unk> them to the same reaction that I had my sister I &apos;ve been talking about this is about seven years . &quot; &quot; And of course , I was saying , &quot;
The <unk> <unk> only <unk> around one percent of the <unk> that we call them and <unk> our <unk> .
And he gets to day , and he was very exciting , very exciting , with many people on the last , 30 people on the last <unk> , 30 people in trying to try to try to try to try to try to try .
Two organizations against the cancer , which is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Chris , and I &apos;m going to show you in the hallway , before he <unk> the <unk> , the most important , the most important , the most important , at the career .
I was much more than it .
But all that panic you have to come from the room and I saw my <unk> , a lot of <unk> , etc , and I saw my <unk> , a lot of waste , and I saw my <unk> , and I saw my <unk> , and I saw you heard of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of a different spectrum of the <unk> , and we &apos;ve been heard the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of a different spectrum of the <unk> , and we saw <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
In the <unk> , they were three times the <unk> <unk> , and she <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> , who had a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , who is a <unk> <unk> to make that day , and we realized that each one of the communities in the room and the <unk> that every single <unk> to do that day , in the game that we had to have a game at the <unk> , and the <unk> that every single <unk> to do that day , in the game that we had to have a
The <unk> was <unk> .
Now , Chris <unk> .
But for me , the more <unk> was to see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the DNA <unk> , through a series of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , of the last seven years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , including <unk> <unk> , and they start a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> with doing a <unk> <unk> of a tree .
And in the time , my moment , the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the DNA will call &quot; &quot; was nature to <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know , when you &apos;d <unk> the result of <unk> , but we can have been <unk> the result of the <unk> , but we can have been <unk> the result , but we can see it &apos;s kind of <unk> , but we can have to be <unk> , but we can see it &apos;s kind of <unk> , but we can have to be <unk> , but
&quot; &quot; A <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> of nature and not <unk> to be just <unk> so just had <unk> .
And what &apos;s more , I &apos;m going to do nothing . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s four to four hours , five pounds , five <unk> <unk> that <unk> the test for the test for the genes .
Some of them <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> than <unk> .
Some of them took a <unk> of the most <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> beyond <unk> .
<unk> with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> genes in America .
<unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
And he said to that patients , <unk> , <unk> , he had had to have the <unk> <unk> that they live .
I grew up in a decision that the <unk> <unk> your decision , I got a small small weapon in the morning .
It was <unk> , a professor of <unk> University , and one of the first people who and Chris , Chris will have been transparent and Chris had to visit to visit to visit , and Chris did not to move to visit to visit , and Chris did not to move to visit .
( Laughter ) <unk> very much of this case .
And <unk> of what they were <unk> from the <unk> that we were <unk> to do the right thing .
The <unk> <unk> almost eight years from the beginning to end , with many <unk> and <unk> .
And so , I &apos;m fortunate to say , but they were the communities that <unk> , and the <unk> that we create , the <unk> that we took the way .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi , I &apos;m going to show you a few years of my projects , <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and we live in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , I call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> in my <unk> dream of my uncle &apos;s dream that do because by it , almost like a <unk> of water or a critical density .
When I &apos;m sorry , the thing was the worse and you &apos;re seeing it as a way of control .
And of course , I was not saying anything because my name is a very <unk> , very <unk> in the family .
What I was <unk> and <unk> was the <unk> of the phone .
He <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> the number of time he was <unk> by the number of it .
And in the answer , and as a uncle was written , &quot; &quot; The phone . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so that , they do , they do that they &apos;re going to have two people to use .
It &apos;s exactly the way that my great <unk> is a <unk> , a person .
The problem is that , when I <unk> home and I went back to <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> with least <unk> .
And so I did a <unk> , I could tell you that I could give their own memories , and <unk> from all the world through emails .
What he had to do was to take a paper , a paper , a paper in the <unk> , he wrote the email he can &apos;t put the paper .
This device <unk> <unk> to the person in a way to get <unk> .
So you can see that they &apos;re going to be many <unk> by <unk> that they were all the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> in an entire entire entire existence .
So my guy just got to a <unk> <unk> .
And then , then , the object has to be <unk> and have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , like you like to my name .
The next job is one of the <unk> of the sound that we call &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> with <unk> with <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , twins and <unk> .
This works like this . We have these <unk> here in the wall , and behind , we have these small creatures that are <unk> .
Instead of us in the silence , <unk> .
And if there &apos;s more silence , <unk> <unk> .
And they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So we have these <unk> in three of the walls of a room .
And we had to study these these little bit of these little <unk> behind .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a prototype prototype .
When there is silence , let &apos;s go out of the <unk> .
And we <unk> like humans , and we <unk> how humans or the real real .
And then , I &apos;m going to show you the sounds that the <unk> <unk> in the end .
They don &apos;t know the sounds of the bottom .
We took a <unk> in a moment where I didn &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) But the sounds of the sounds of the first one . It &apos;s a second .
( Laughter ) We very hard to do the more <unk> , possible .
Each of it has their own behavior , <unk> , changes in humor , <unk> , etc .
This is a very active .
And of course , was the best after that .
We had to <unk> people , but we think people was quite quite <unk> and <unk> them .
This is a device , &quot; &quot; The person &apos;s &quot; &quot; The person , &quot; &quot; We are quite <unk> with the idea of <unk> with <unk> .
How would we be possible to do that we can <unk> ?
We worked with a <unk> company , and we asked them to give a <unk> , we could give a <unk> , that could be able to get people in the room , and to watch this people and give you a person with the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you a very short .
So , you can see , you can see my colleague <unk> , which is in the space .
And the left , you &apos;ll see the video <unk> where the camera is the <unk> .
It &apos;s going on the newspaper . No !
You can see how the camera is the <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s a video , so that we still still not <unk> , and all that even not <unk> , and all that , but we &apos;ve got it to be honest , more .
This is a room where there was a camera , and we had a <unk> in the space , and we had a <unk> in every wall .
And second people come into the room , <unk> to themselves , at the same as you can see , but by a difference , a person was constantly <unk> where you want to get in the room .
This job is called &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; It was almost a <unk> of paper , like a <unk> of a <unk> of oil or a sun .
So in front , this object , it has to be very strong and <unk> and <unk> , almost so very weak .
People have been through the room and almost the <unk> thinking that was just a <unk> .
But instead , they &apos;re going to be <unk> by the wall , <unk> the way of <unk> .
They <unk> and <unk> always .
( Laughter ) This job is a <unk> of a man .
His head , it gets heavy , full of them fell down off the <unk> , which seems to be a <unk> in his <unk> , his body <unk> , almost a tail .
What does it &apos;s actually to move on your head as if he was in a very <unk> motion , and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like <unk> that .
Because if you didn &apos;t go out there and the only one , the only one , <unk> <unk> in space .
And there are no <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you a example , when people go into room , he &apos;s got this object .
And so , I &apos;ll go out , in the minutes , it turns up , it gets <unk> , it gets <unk> and it seems to be a number of <unk> .
This is a moment because we wanted to be <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of almost go and help , to save the subject .
But I had to be not because he &apos;s same because he &apos;s same to be able to see it again .
This job was a <unk> of <unk> for us and very hard , as well as well , as most of our jobs , for years , for a very dynamic , and a lot of it .
It was very important for us to be the <unk> at the time we <unk> , because if we were <unk> , because they were <unk> , and if you don &apos;t get the <unk> , or that effect , or if you don &apos;t want to go to the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you a very quickly , we do a test . It &apos;s much more faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . We &apos;ll go to go .
Now it &apos;s incredibly nervous , so it &apos;s going to take .
But they don &apos;t need to do , because it &apos;s going to be <unk> by itself , because he &apos;s <unk> by itself .
This is a job that we &apos;ve been very <unk> , and I <unk> the <unk> of the skin , with thousands of the skin , <unk> thousands of <unk> <unk> , which <unk> like the sky .
And it &apos;s the scale of the sky .
And I &apos;m going to be that about a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> , which was <unk> of the floor .
The idea was to be <unk> something so cold , <unk> and <unk> like the universe with the way with the way with the way with the way of <unk> , which is very <unk> and .
The idea was that at the time , I &apos;m looking at the way of the way of the way , and we almost <unk> as a <unk> in space , like <unk> , and you &apos;ll see you , and you &apos;ll see , you &apos;ll see a sky <unk> .
This is the last job , but yet , he &apos;s called the <unk> , and he &apos;s called the <unk> of <unk> . &quot; &quot; So you want to see that in the front of the big , and that &apos;s a <unk> of the big in front of the room and the four of his volume .
This object is in <unk> and <unk> to create a lot of people , and he &apos;s in <unk> a lot of <unk> in their way , or something like that .
We work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t do that , because we live in the job , for the job , and years .
But we &apos;re using because that we &apos;re interested in the way that we have learned in the way that we have been able to communicate and patterns in these creatures that we create .
When a <unk> <unk> in the mind , and almost as the process of the <unk> was to <unk> the way that this <unk> cannot be , that way to take and how they want to move .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to start to be <unk> by a useful trick , and everything else &apos;s about you is : that <unk> of <unk> for two minutes .
But before I want to <unk> right now , I want to <unk> right now , and what you &apos;re doing with it with him .
So , how many of you are getting a little bit ?
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes we give them the whales so .
Sometimes you . ( Laughter ) I see you .
<unk> attention to the point that you do right now .
Let &apos;s go back to that in the minutes and I hope that if you &apos;ll get to <unk> a little bit , you can see the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re <unk> with language language and <unk> and language , <unk> language .
You know , I &apos;m going to do — this , and — ( Laughter ) <unk> that a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of your brain , or even something like a week of hands .
<unk> : This is now now in the number of 10 .
This police has been to go and go to the <unk> of the United States .
That &apos;s the first Minister — I don &apos;t . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) <unk> : A week — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) <unk> : A week : A week of hands , or his <unk> , can we have to have for weeks , weeks , and I think , can we have to have for weeks , weeks , and I think it &apos;s <unk> , can go for weeks , weeks , and I think , can we have to have for weeks , weeks , and I think it &apos;s <unk>
It &apos;s the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So when we think of this expression , we don &apos;t have <unk> or language — we don &apos;t have <unk> , we don &apos;t have <unk> , we know .
So we have to talk about that in language .
What do it does , your language ?
What do it really is to do ?
There &apos;s reason for believe that &apos;s the way that we &apos;re living .
The <unk> <unk> have a lot of time or a <unk> , or on other people , about the <unk> .
We do <unk> and <unk> language , and <unk> language .
And that <unk> that you can see the life in life as the who <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , who you want to show a email .
For example , <unk> at the University of <unk> , you see that when you look at 30 years of <unk> , you see that when you look at 30 years of <unk> , that &apos;s a physician is not going to be <unk> or not .
So it &apos;s not that you can see that with the doctor was or not <unk> , but they don &apos;t get it , but like you .
And more <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a second percent , the 70 percent of the <unk> of the career .
If you do a bad <unk> , you do ?
Speaking of language , not to be <unk> , and how we &apos;re looking at each other , as we &apos;re <unk> and what they are the consequences .
But I &apos;m going to show you another another audience in which our language is not <unk> , that we are .
We <unk> our language not , our thoughts , and penicillin .
What do you don &apos;t know ?
It &apos;s social social <unk> . He &apos;s <unk> and I asked them in a <unk> school school , so that was actually <unk> the power of power .
<unk> on all the way they don &apos;t get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
What are the <unk> of power and <unk> ?
Well , they are this .
In the animal points , they have to see the primary <unk> , the animal points have to see with the primary Kingdom of the animal , they have to see the primary Kingdom of the animal , they have to see the primary Kingdom of the animal , they have to see the primary Kingdom of the animal , they have to see the primary Kingdom of the animal , they have to see the primary Kingdom of the animal , they have to see the primary Kingdom of the animal , they have to see the primary
It &apos;s going to be big , <unk> , <unk> space .
It &apos;s <unk> .
And it works like this , the animal Passage , the animal population .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be honest .
The humans do we do the same thing . ( Laughter ) <unk> so when they have power in the past , and they also when they feel in the moment .
This is especially interesting because we &apos;re going to go and <unk> that are these <unk> in power .
This expression , we call it <unk> by <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk>
And we say that the people who see since they were <unk> that they &apos;re <unk> the same when they put an competition competition .
So when they &apos;re <unk> the line of the <unk> and they stop no matter if they never never seen .
They have to do that .
The <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> something <unk> .
What do we do when we do that when we move on the color ?
We do the <unk> right .
<unk> . <unk> .
They were small little .
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> with that &apos;s what we &apos;re in our .
And so the animals like we do the same thing .
And that &apos;s what happens when we &apos;re trying to be able to <unk> .
What we do is to do when it &apos;s actually <unk> language , and what we can do is to do not change .
So if you have to be a powerful , you will get the <unk> , the most small <unk> .
We do the opposite .
If you see this in the class , which is <unk> ?
They <unk> that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> all the language couldn &apos;t be <unk> .
There are people who are interested in the <unk> , <unk> in the same way before they start to class , as if they <unk> <unk> space .
When they go back , they go back .
It &apos;s going to hand like that .
And there are other people who have <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> in his face and in his body , you &apos;re going to see , you &apos;re going to wear <unk> , and you do that when you go to hand .
So here we have two things .
One &apos;t you get to get it .
You have to have to see with the sex .
Women are more <unk> to do that men .
The women <unk> always less than people , so that this is not surprising .
But the other thing that I was learned is that it seems to be with the Parkinson &apos;s <unk> with the orchestra of a <unk> level .
And that &apos;s very important in the class , because the <unk> of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece
<unk> schools , you can do with the distinction of <unk> .
<unk> women and men would be <unk> and then you see these differences in the notes , which is being <unk> in the part of this .
So I started to <unk> : if you are people who have <unk> that <unk> that <unk> , and he <unk> , and I started to <unk> : if you are <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started to <unk> , if you are <unk> , and I started a <unk> , and I started to <unk> , if I started <unk> , if you are people who have <unk> that are <unk> with that .
And it would be possible to do that other people and that the bacteria will be to be more ?
My <unk> <unk> , which is in <unk> , and I realized that if you can bring it to do it .
I mean , you can only do it just for a point and you can learn a result in your behavior that you do much more powerful ?
We know that language doesn &apos;t make the way that other people think they were on and think of us . There are lots of tests .
But our question was , we &apos;re going to be <unk> language , not what it &apos;s really , and we thought of it ?
There are some evidence that that is .
For example , I &apos;m going to tell you when we &apos;re happy , but also when we get to <unk> it to <unk> , with me happy happy .
It &apos;s <unk> on the two <unk> .
When it comes to power , it works in the two <unk> .
When we feel it , it &apos;s really more likely to do that , but it also is possible that when you &apos;re really really really , you &apos;re more likely to really do .
Well , second question was , well , we know that the mind will be our body , but it &apos;s true also that the body <unk> our mind ?
And when I say , in the case , I &apos;m going to talk about ?
Well , I &apos;m looking at it and and the other side of the <unk> that are going to look at those thoughts and the photos and in my case , I &apos;m talking about it .
How is the mind of the <unk> of the <unk> that you don &apos;t know , they are ?
People tend to be , not , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more than it .
They have to be <unk> with that they will put at the same way .
They also tend to think of a more <unk> .
There are a lot of differences . We live more risks .
There are a lot of between the differences between the ones and the other people are .
It also also have to be <unk> differences in two hormones , and the <unk> , which is the hormone <unk> , and the <unk> , which is the hormone of stress .
<unk> <unk> with a very <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the humanities and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
That means that ? We talk to speak , <unk> to just <unk> , because he was to see with <unk> .
But the power has also to see with our reaction to the stress .
We want to be a model , with a very power , with <unk> <unk> , but we start to <unk> the stress ?
It &apos;s not , right ?
We want a person who is powerful , but we want to do it , but not very to make the stress of the stress , a person who &apos;s actually actually actually make .
We know that in the <unk> of <unk> , if you have a <unk> of it , if you have to take the control , if someone has to make the control , if someone has to be able to be <unk> , and he was <unk> .
We have that evidence , that the body can be <unk> , at least the level of <unk> , and also that the paper can <unk> the mind .
So what happens when you get to one about the paper ? What is if you look at a level , like this little <unk> or <unk> ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; I want to do that for two minutes you might have so , that you might see it , that you might see it more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that was what we did .
We had to bring people to the lab , to do a little experiment , those people have <unk> , for two minutes , they &apos;ve been <unk> , and I &apos;m going to show you right now five of those <unk> , but they have to be <unk> , but they &apos;re going to be just like these two <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
A couple more more than a couple of more than a couple more than a more than a couple of more than a couple of more than a more than a more than a more than a more than a couple of more than a couple of more than a more than a more than a more than a more than a couple of more than a couple of more than a more than a more than a more than a more than a couple of more than a couple of more than a more than a more than
The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And .
So here we have a couple more .
You can be <unk> , or sitting .
Here they are the <unk> of standardization .
Now , at your little .
This is very <unk> and .
When you go to <unk> <unk> , really , really .
This is what happens .
They come down , <unk> in a <unk> , and I put on the two minutes , &quot; &quot; You have to do this , or you have to do this , or that you don &apos;t do this or that . &quot;
We don &apos;t want to be a concept of that <unk> that .
We want to focus on the power .
They have to have this two minutes .
And then <unk> , &quot; &quot; how <unk> you know , then I &apos;m going to be a chance of on the end , the first we did another <unk> .
That &apos;s all . This is the experiment .
This is what we found .
<unk> at the risk , we find up on the risk of <unk> , you find that when they &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When they are in <unk> under the <unk> <unk> , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
Let &apos;s see what we find with the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> in his situation in the way , the people have an iPhone 20 percent , and the <unk> that is about 10 percent .
And again , for the two minutes , and we &apos;ve been <unk> those changes .
Now the results of the <unk> .
The more unequal societies is a 25 percent of the <unk> , the more <unk> than a bump from about 15 percent .
I just two minutes of these minutes , these changes in the brain <unk> that you have to do that , or <unk> , or <unk> , or well , well , well , well , well , or <unk> as <unk> .
We all know that it works with that .
<unk> that our language is not to be <unk> the way of the way to the same way , not only the other , but the way .
The body can <unk> the mind .
The next question , of course , is , you can a gesture of power in the <unk> , the life expectancy in a very significant ?
This is in the lab , this experiment , they &apos;re just two minutes .
Where do you really do that ?
That &apos;s what we call .
We think where they were being in <unk> in the <unk> that you have <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
I think you know , even your friends .
For the <unk> is in the prison , the <unk> <unk> .
For some people , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the school .
It might be to the <unk> of the head , or a <unk> <unk> like this , or let &apos;s go back in the job .
It &apos;s a <unk> that people people have to be because many of people were <unk> because many of <unk> .
So the results , the media <unk> and said , well , that &apos;s what you do when you &apos;re going to go to a <unk> , right ?
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to be <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; No , you don &apos;t know what we knew .
For many reasons , not , it &apos;s not .
So again , it &apos;s not about it to other people .
It &apos;s actually talk to do with with you .
What do you do before I go to the one of the job ? <unk> that .
You &apos;re sitting in the <unk> , you will put your iPhone — or your Android is not to be no .
You have the difficult to your text , you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , when what you should be doing doing is that , maybe in <unk> , right ?
That is what we want to do , right ?
You know , people in the lab , and you <unk> <unk> <unk> and you could see that again , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> in the job <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have five minutes of five minutes . They <unk> <unk> .
And they are the <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> for not , not just <unk> like that .
Imagine that person &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; What this person is like .
For five minutes , nothing , is worse than you .
People have to get this .
It &apos;s what we call <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And this <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> of the <unk> , because we &apos;ll see what <unk> that <unk> .
We have to <unk> the doctors , four to the doctors , four .
They don &apos;t know what they can &apos;t do .
They don &apos;t have the idea that the normal has been <unk> every person and the <unk> of all the people , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to <unk> these people . &quot; &quot; And all of the <unk> of power .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
And what was happening ? &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It &apos;s not about it &apos;s content .
It &apos;s the presence of the presence of the <unk> .
Because the <unk> in all those <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> ?
Is it right ? What do you do ? What ?
These things don &apos;t affect . That &apos;s what it has all .
This kind of things .
Every person is yes , we basically .
We know what they are .
They put their ideas , by themselves , without the way , without any .
So that &apos;s what it is , or to do the effect .
When I &apos;m talking to people about this , which our body will change our mind and the behavior can change our way to be , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s <unk> . &quot; &quot; Oh ?
And I was <unk> , <unk> to you .
I don &apos;t know that .
I don &apos;t want to get there and <unk> like a <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> like a <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to get there there for me that I couldn &apos;t get there .
This is very important for me , because I want to tell you a little story about being a little story about being a <unk> and about how they didn &apos;t get there .
When I was <unk> years old , a car car .
<unk> , it was <unk> , and a lot of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> from the car .
I put in the head in front of the <unk> in a head , <unk> from <unk> and I was my <unk> , I was <unk> , and I was very <unk> .
I was my <unk> , because I was <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I was <unk> from <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t go to the career .
You have to have to create other things that you can do , but in your case that doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; I was to say with that , and I have to say that I &apos;m going to say that you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; I was to say that you can &apos;t do it .
They &apos;re completely <unk> .
And I worked and I worked and I worked and I worked and I worked and I worked on , and I worked on .
And finally <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;m four years old , I was my <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you someone , my <unk> <unk> , so I <unk> , so my <unk> <unk> , so I was <unk> , so I &apos;m going to be there .
<unk> before the exhibition <unk> .
It &apos;s like that .
And I had so much of the <unk> , the next day I was <unk> and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be nothing , because I &apos;m going to be wrong , because I &apos;m going to be you .
You go to be , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
You can go to do all the <unk> that you can see .
It &apos;s going to do , and to do it , and I &apos;m still even wondering , or even a <unk> <unk> , or even a <unk> experience , until you get to see that moment , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; .
I was going to go to here . I &apos;m going to do now . And that was what I did .
<unk> years old , a few years , you know , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I &apos;m not just at Harvard , I &apos;m not never to be there .
The <unk> of my freshman year , a student who didn &apos;t have to be in the class , which is <unk> , &quot; &quot; You see , &quot; &quot; You see , &quot; &quot; you see , &quot; &quot; you see , &quot; &quot; you see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; And she said to my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And she said to my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And she said to my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And she said to my <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , told me , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to be here . &quot;
That was my moment .
Because they &apos;re going to be two things .
The first one I said , I &apos;m going to ask ! I &apos;m not like this .
I don &apos;t know that but she was she at the but she &apos;s going to be so she had to be able to get it in their place .
The second was , of course , I mean , I &apos;m going to be here !
And they said , that can be <unk> and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes , you might have to be here ! &quot; &quot; .
You &apos;re going to be <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) You go to go and you know the best speech , people go to the best speech , and he was going to show you a little few months after you can &apos;t make the better speech . ( Laughter )
So , I was <unk> .
Now I want to tell you that there is no <unk> that we &apos;ve been to do .
There are <unk> to be able to live .
There are that the enough to be able to pay and <unk> .
The last one I &apos;m going to say , is that .
<unk> changes , they can be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> changes , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> changes , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> changes , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> changes , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> changes , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk>
They &apos;re just two minutes .
Before we <unk> to the next situation where you might be <unk> , for two minutes , we have <unk> this , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> the door .
This is what you have to do .
We put the brain to make the better that this is better that .
We <unk> <unk> . They <unk> the <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> that this <unk> like I don &apos;t think they are .
And I &apos;m going to be that with that this situation with that I say who are and I &apos;m going to do that are and I &apos;m going to show you that with those <unk> .
I want to say before I was a very remote position , and I also want to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My aspiration is not on this . ( Laughter ) <unk> , <unk> people , because the best can use those are not those resources or technology , without the power .
They <unk> them to each other , because they can do it in the private sector .
We just need their body , in the past , and two minutes to change the <unk> of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;m going to talk about is the problems of the big problems .
I &apos;m not going to talk to &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; — probably that is a good option .
( Laughter ) So , I &apos;m going to be talking about what the big problems of the world ?
And I &apos;m saying , before I <unk> , you &apos;re going to each one of you that <unk> <unk> and paper , because I &apos;m going to ask you to see how we do .
So they &apos;re <unk> and paper .
And they were used to be a lot of the problems in the world .
I &apos;m going to be just some some .
A million people to be able to be able to live a year .
<unk> million people don &apos;t have access to the water .
Two one of the without <unk> .
<unk> million people die of their own AIDS , and they die .
<unk> .
Two billion people who will be <unk> to be <unk> by <unk> — and <unk> .
We have many , many problems .
There is a world , all the <unk> all , but we do not do it .
The truth is that not all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do , the question I think we can do — and that &apos;s the why we &apos;re doing — and that is the why we &apos;re in <unk> of the economy — is , if we do we start to ask , what we are going to do , that we should be first ? &quot; &quot; What we are right ?
That &apos;s the question I could like to do .
If you ask , 50 billion <unk> to get in the next four years to get the four years to improve this world , right ?
We &apos;ve been 10 of the most of the <unk> <unk> and just <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , education , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> to the trade .
We think these , we think , the biggest problems , the biggest problems of the world .
The question , the question would be <unk> , which you think are the biggest ?
Why do we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s what happens about a <unk> .
It &apos;s really , that was the <unk> of what he knew about <unk> in <unk> .
But it , there is a problem if you get to people who were <unk> in the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
So the most of the problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have to technology to do that , we have ?
So the question is not to be wrong , but they will increase the <unk> .
And I would be — so that if you make a little more complicated powerful .
For the <unk> <unk> , it would be something like <unk> .
For diseases , they could be either either , they could be either either themselves .
For the <unk> , he would be the forces of <unk> , and so we can see .
What I was like to do that , and I know that in 30 years — I know that I think of it &apos;s something like that they think are the <unk> of them .
And also — in here , of course , where the economy is — <unk> what we don &apos;t want to do with first , <unk> what we don &apos;t want to do with first place .
What should be the end of the <unk> ?
And we &apos;ve been a few years , perhaps <unk> with people , and just suddenly think they should be the <unk> , and just imagine what they have to do for the world .
What is the <unk> of this process — of course , I mean , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say — I &apos;m just 18 minutes of my time , not ?
And I would like to <unk> , and I think about this process , and that &apos;s what we did .
And also the <unk> of the <unk> , and I &apos;m sure that you can &apos;t look at these <unk> , so that &apos;s what we really really do ?
So , there are what we asked the same thing , because they never never have to be done a <unk> like this ?
And one reason is that the <unk> is <unk> .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all the organizations , we have to be in the most <unk> of a <unk> .
But it also all the <unk> <unk> don &apos;t be in the more <unk> .
And there are many more , &quot; &quot; no <unk> &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; is , you didn &apos;t want to be a list like this .
There are 60 years ago , and it doesn &apos;t have to have the <unk> of the big things that we can do in the world , and say , what we do is first ?
That doesn &apos;t mean that we &apos;re not <unk> — every decision is a <unk> , so that the fact we actually do that , but that the fact we &apos;re still <unk> , and that &apos;s not really cool , and that &apos;s not really good as good as we really did , and <unk> and <unk> that .
So what I &apos;m really really is that we had to say that , for a long time , a very long time , a <unk> period of time , a situation in which in traditional fields .
There are many , many things that we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , but we don &apos;t have the prices , and the <unk> .
We had had a idea .
Imagine that you had to put a restaurant , but you have a enormous <unk> , but you know what the prices do .
You know , you have to be <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t know what the same .
It might be a <unk> , they could be $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
Could be a <unk> of familiar , I could be a familiar , you might do ? &quot; &quot; Oh , you ?
We &apos;ll know these things .
And that &apos;s what the monkey is trying to do the <unk> <unk> — that &apos;s actually actually actually put the prices of these issues .
And so , we see , this is the <unk> process of <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to show you about the best one <unk> in the world , three of every area .
So , I was <unk> three of the best <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What we can do ? What is the <unk> that we can do ? What is the way of doing it ?
The same <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Three of the best <unk> , we can do ?
What is the price ?
What we do about that , and what would be the result ?
And so in front of the front .
So we took some of the best best <unk> political agencies , eight from the best <unk> in the world , including three <unk> , <unk> in <unk> in 2004 .
The call &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the economy .
It works it works on Europe , but here we didn &apos;t see .
And , what they did , was to be a <unk> <unk> .
And then you look at , why did it ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy to me that I was going to be that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a good question .
The issue is that , obviously , if you want to know , you ask , you just just a name about malaria .
If you want to know about the climate change , they &apos;re just a <unk> .
But if you want to know what the two of two you might have first , you cannot get the one of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
<unk> .
They have to have that <unk> something <unk> , which we do first , and what we do do after .
So this is the list , and this is the <unk> that I &apos;ve heard you with you .
Now , you can also see the web , and I &apos;m true of that you can &apos;t see the day .
They were <unk> a list in which they were projects projects — ( Applause ) <unk> , projects where you have a <unk> , and you &apos;ve got less than a <unk> like that , and you &apos;ve been less than a <unk> like .
And then they were the projects projects , and good good , and the good <unk> .
And of course , are the projects , how good we do we do .
And I &apos;m going to start to start from the last last <unk> that I would be going to be with the best projects .
These were bad .
You can see the end of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably probably one of the things about people think we don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
And I hope to speak about that , because it &apos;s really important .
Why did ?
And the truth , I was also <unk> to speak up on this because it &apos;s probably one of the things we don &apos;t get to be with the <unk> .
The reason he was to say that that is that we &apos;ve been — or to do something more than <unk> — not , it &apos;s a good only only only only only only but it &apos;s very <unk> .
It &apos;s not say that there is no global global .
It &apos;s not say that &apos;s not a big problem .
But it is to say that what we can do why do is very little , the very small cost .
What in the point , the average is all the <unk> <unk> and that <unk> , if everything <unk> was in the right , <unk> about 150 billion deaths a year .
That &apos;s a important amount of money .
Two or three times the global society that <unk> the Third World every year .
And so to do very little .
The <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> about six years on the <unk> .
So a kind of <unk> that he had been a <unk> in the <unk> , you can see it to <unk> .
What it &apos;s something like , but it &apos;s something good , but it &apos;s something good .
So the idea , and say , well , they &apos;ll be a lot of money .
And just by <unk> , the <unk> that the environment has been learned that the amount of that amount , about 75 billion dollars per year , we can solve all the largest problems are basic in the world .
It <unk> <unk> water , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and education all the human beings .
So we might be <unk> , we want to be the way that we actually do very little ?
Or I &apos;ve been learned to some of doing something that really really good ?
And it &apos;s where if it &apos;s <unk> in a project .
It &apos;s not say that if you get all the money of the world , not the <unk> .
<unk> , that when we do not , just our first <unk> .
The projects are — not going to be heard all — but <unk> , the scale of the biggest services — the sound , the sound , just just a little thing .
They have very well , but it also , but it also very <unk> .
One more , what we call the &quot; &quot; and we started thinking about that two times the equation .
If you look at the same projects , they make a lot of projects projects .
One more , the <unk> and the water is <unk> , but it also costs a lot of <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four four <unk> that they should be , at least , the first we used to talk about how we can solve the problems of the world .
The <unk> is the malaria , we do malaria .
<unk> of the <unk> — is about a couple of people in a year .
It might even have a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the year for <unk> .
If you go to a half billion dollars in the next four years , we could see the <unk> of half .
We &apos;ve been given to death death , but what is perhaps , we could create that billion , we could prevent a year .
<unk> <unk> your ability to do many of the other problems that they have to see . Of course , in the time , we also <unk> with the global global .
The third one is the <unk> of the entire <unk> .
Basically , the model was that if you could do the function at the same sophisticated , and especially it <unk> the <unk> of the East , and in Europe , we can <unk> the global economy , the half of which <unk> <unk> in the year , the half of which <unk> <unk> of the Third World .
One more , we could actually actually start to 200 200 or 300 million people from poverty , and very fast , and very quickly , between two and five years .
That would be the third better thing that we could do .
The second better thing would be <unk> in the <unk> .
It doesn &apos;t be <unk> in a little way , but a very economic way , is , the <unk> of <unk> .
Basically , half of the population population has <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and D <unk> .
If you go back to 12 billion dollars , we could do a <unk> <unk> in this problem .
This is the second best <unk> that we could do .
And the best project would be used to be in AIDS AIDS .
Basically , if we &apos;ve been 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could create <unk> million of new patients in the <unk> 90 .
Again , what this does is and what this does is , and what it is actually <unk> that we have two forms different than trying to do that , AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is the <unk> .
One more , in a world , we have the two .
But in a world where we do any of the two or where we do not do it , we do not just look at very well , but when we &apos;re going to be first .
And the treatment is too , much more expensive than the <unk> .
So , I was <unk> , what this is going to say is that we can do much more than in the <unk> .
Basically to the amount of money that we can do was to do it well , and 10 times more in <unk> .
So , more , we should also <unk> more than in the treatment , as the first option .
What this is really is that really really really really , think of our <unk> .
You might remember that you have to put it into your head , and you say , the <unk> ?
You know , or <unk> to something like that we did here ?
Well , I &apos;m <unk> , one of the things is going to be <unk> .
We &apos;ve got many people who think it &apos;s very , but they &apos;re very little , that we did .
It also also be used to <unk> , if there &apos;s no other point , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t know all the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if we &apos;re on the problems , we &apos;re <unk> us more .
We &apos;ve been a lot of more than a little bit .
And I think , the truth — Thomas <unk> , one of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; , the very <unk> , very well .
One of the things that people <unk> , and that &apos;s the people , and that &apos;s most years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the <unk> <unk> , the people will be very much more .
Even the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
We &apos;ve been a person in the world in the development in the <unk> , it will be as rich as we &apos;re today .
And much more likely to do , but the four times the four <unk> of the we &apos;re in the .
And of course , we will be even more rich than that .
But the question is , that when we speak to save people , people to help people in <unk> , we &apos;re not talking about a poor <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about a <unk> quite rich .
And so the real thing , of course , that is , we want to be a lot of money to give a long few times a little bit , from the age of the age , and a <unk> <unk> ?
You want to help people in the poor , on the way , we want to help people in your own , on the time , who are you can help very help ?
Or as the <unk> , imagine you , imagine the <unk> — as you will — a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in thinking in 2005 , &quot; &quot; What is that you might be so much for you a little with that <unk> , and if you &apos;re going to be much more <unk> , and my <unk> , who would be <unk> to be able to give us to my own <unk> and my <unk> , who would be much more to help , and if you &apos;re going to be a
Even if you don &apos;t get to the way to see this problem .
And of course , that &apos;s really important , because the <unk> has has been a good photos .
You know what we have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; — it seems to be great , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie , in the sense of that I want to see , but I don &apos;t think that <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in his next <unk> <unk> <unk> in 2005 or something like that . ( Laughter )
So in many ways , I think the <unk> <unk> and all the way about the <unk> of the <unk> is a medical degree .
For it to do that not just for the bad thing , but it &apos;s really good for it .
It &apos;s not going to do the things that they have the largest <unk> <unk> , but it also is going to make in places where we can actually do a little bit .
The other reason I think , that are important , is that I &apos;ve been some of some <unk> I — or we &apos;re — the <unk> of a philosophy .
Of course we might do that all , in a world , it would be not about it .
I think we might do all the things , but we do not do it .
At the <unk> , the world has decided to be the air as we did , right now , that in the U.S. in the world .
As our help , I &apos;ve been our help .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be in the way of <unk> all the big problems .
What the same thing , people also did , but what is the war of <unk> ?
You know , they will be a billion million people . Why don &apos;t do that , and the right thing .
I &apos;m going to show you .
If you can talk to me to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But the reason is that , that if you go to each other , that if you go to each other , we have <unk> <unk> the best way , right ?
So the real problem , is to start to be new and think of what the <unk> has the <unk> .
I mean I &apos;m going to be honest , is this really going to be wrong ?
You know , when you go to the best <unk> in the world , <unk> <unk> by <unk> men and old the United States of the United States , <unk> <unk> by men and old the United States .
And they &apos;re not really a way that you look at the world .
So we took the 80 to 80 to the world to be <unk> the same problem .
The <unk> of these <unk> were that they were on in <unk> , and they were English .
Most of them were , first , first , <unk> , <unk> .
They have the same material , but they could be <unk> so much of the issue , as we actually made , to put their own own .
And the amazing thing was the very similar was very similar , with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> at the end .
We have to have this many other times .
And there are many other people , and students have to <unk> and things .
We all have the same way to the same .
And that I was the great hope , really , so I think I think there &apos;s a way that there is a way to think at that at that at that time , and say , what &apos;s the most important of the world ?
Of course , in a world , we &apos;re going to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do everything , we can start to think about where they <unk> ?
I see the <unk> <unk> as a process .
So we did in 2004 , and we hope to go a lot more than people , to get a better information in 2008 , <unk> .
It &apos;s the way to the right right to the world . But we also start to think about <unk> policy .
To start to think , &quot; &quot; We do we do the things on the <unk> that you can see a little bit <unk> , and the things we don &apos;t know how to do , but we do it really kind of <unk> where we do , but we do it , but we do it , but we have a lot of things we do , but we have a lot of things we do .
If you look at a lot of some things , we &apos;re <unk> by a lot of some things , we &apos;re <unk> by a other .
So what this is we actually actually actually actually make a better , and think as we work better than the world .
Thank you .
There are a few years ago , I was going to go home home .
He had been to come home and <unk> <unk> to visit the <unk> to visit , and that &apos;s <unk> , because that &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> .
And I was in <unk> , for us , for those books and <unk> realized that I couldn &apos;t have the difficult .
In fact , I could see that the window of the table , where the <unk> .
But they were all <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t have <unk> at the home of my friend because the morning , he was a old old , and I got to take the <unk> and I got the <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to be <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to show you a <unk> , and he <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> , and she <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
They have a lot of money but they didn &apos;t think that a <unk> <unk> in the night .
Well , we &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the right , and I <unk> to the <unk> of neuroscience .
<unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> under the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So , at the morning , when I was going to remember after , I was going to be a little bit of the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that he was in in Europe , and the <unk> that was in Europe in Europe , and the <unk> <unk> that he was in Europe in Europe , and the <unk> that was in Europe in Europe , the mind is <unk> in Europe , and the <unk> <unk> that he was in Europe in Europe , and the <unk> <unk> that he was
And until it to be <unk> from the <unk> <unk> I couldn &apos;t realize that <unk> .
So I went to the home , with snow and ice , and ice , and ice , in 40 minutes , I was the <unk> and I &apos;ve been <unk> my old , another person , but I was my old , another person , but I was my wife to another person person , but I was my wife to another person person , but I was my wife to another person person , but I was my wife to another person person , but I was my wife to another person person , but I was
Or , in the case that you &apos;ve been really really , at the case that you do .
And he &apos;s going to tell you and she &apos;d like to me .
It was something that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> about that there was a few years ago , and it would also be if he &apos;s called <unk> .
So I was a team of <unk> that we can determine what happened , right ?
Well , in <unk> , as she explained , she &apos;s trying to determine what you can do do to do do what do we do .
What I want to talk to you today is what we can do today .
One things are <unk> , other things are <unk> , other things are <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to start to start by <unk> .
<unk> places for all the home to the things that they were lost .
Well , this looks like common , and it &apos;s so that it seems to be a common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common , and it &apos;s like this sense of common
There is a structure of the brain , the hippocampus that evolved through hundreds of years to remember the location of things .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain brain is the hippocampus of the brain brain is the hippocampus of the brain brain is the <unk> part of the brain brain to the hippocampus of the brain is the brain part of the brain brain is the <unk> part of the brain brain to the hippocampus of the brain is the brain part of the brain brain is the <unk> part of the brain brain to the hippocampus of the brain is the brain part of the brain brain is the <unk> part of the brain brain to the
It &apos;s part of the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain to the brain brain
In fact , there is a guy to did the experiment to be the experiment to <unk> sense of the <unk> .
But it works with that it &apos;s going to work that you don &apos;t have to be too much and not with things that they <unk> .
So there are a few days for your keys .
For the <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in a <unk> , in a table .
If you go to a place and if it &apos;s <unk> the things they will be in their place when the <unk> .
And when you go to <unk> a picture with a seat .
And I was a email to get to the <unk> to the muscles <unk> .
These things are <unk> .
You know , when we &apos;re using these stresses , the brain <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , and we <unk> the mind .
It has recognize that you can &apos;t be able to be able to do the best of you , and you know , a system .
And that when you get to a decision .
We all have to be at a situation at a situation , at that one .
And about that I want to talk .
or any decision that we have to do to do to do that do we do to do .
This is you to go into a doctor and that says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the test and have the <unk> .
You know what the pain is <unk> .
And they were in thinking that they have high cholesterol <unk> is not good , but the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a drug , but the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to give you a drug , you don &apos;t know , and you &apos;re one of the drugs , and you &apos;re one of the drugs that are you to be <unk> and know what are one of the drugs .
<unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the number of the number of <unk> <unk> , and what &apos;s the <unk> ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to be a drug that they have to be able to be able to get a person before I &apos;m going to get a person .
And they said , &quot; &quot; What is that ?
The number should be a <unk> , my physician don &apos;t have to be something that I don &apos;t have to do . &quot;
But the human medicine does this .
We can &apos;t know how much gold do .
<unk> that 90 percent of the drugs work in a 30 percent , and one percent of the cases .
So what the <unk> is in the case of the <unk> <unk> what you think about that ?
How many people have to be before you have to do that you have to give somebody ?
This second results , the results of the results of the results of the results of the results , the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results , the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results , the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results , the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results , the results of the results of the results
And I was actually <unk> data .
And they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
Instead of this .
And they used things . They <unk> <unk> in the muscles and <unk> , <unk> <unk> — But <unk> , &quot; &quot; A <unk> . I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to show you .
You have 15 times more likely to the drug you have to do .
I &apos;m not saying if you were <unk> <unk> or not not , or not , or not , not , or not , or not , or not , <unk> <unk> or not not , or not , or not , or not , or not , <unk> <unk> or not not , or not , or not , or not , or not , <unk> <unk> or not not , or not , or not , or not , or not , <unk> <unk> or not not , or not , or not , or not ,
You just have to have this conversation with your physician .
You have to have to have the information to have this information to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to talk to speak to
I &apos;m going to remember that number of this number to <unk> but actually <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> for cancer , <unk> is <unk> .
Yes , there are <unk> <unk> by every person that you &apos;ve ever help .
And the side effects in this facility , <unk> at 50 percent of patients .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , the idea of the <unk> <unk> , the conversation is to the conversation , and the conversation is to be a <unk> that the conversation is to be <unk> to the conversation .
The real thing is not to have to create all this at the time .
There are a think that think about the quality of the quality .
They &apos;re things on the most people we have to think now and <unk> the family .
You &apos;re going to see the brain is <unk> , and one of the things that &apos;s happening at that moment is that if you get a lot of systems .
<unk> , we know .
And if the body <unk> in these things , because the body <unk> in these things and not <unk> and <unk> things that are <unk> and not <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> , one of the things that if you &apos;ve been <unk> , and one of the things that they were in the <unk> of the <unk> goods and their colleagues .
So that we need to be <unk> to think of this kind of <unk> .
And I think the most important is they recognize that we all have <unk> .
So we were now <unk> .
The idea is to think that can be these <unk> , <unk> systems that can be these <unk> , <unk> systems that can <unk> the <unk> or just heard that things .
And I was that night night with me on <unk> . &quot; &quot; When I went to the <unk> , with the front of the home and an <unk> and an <unk> and <unk> <unk> to remember .
They are not entirely <unk> .
<unk> , I was <unk> .
They are <unk> ?
Why ? No , we do it &apos;s nothing .
&quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; <unk> , please , please ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Are you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
It seemed like to have to speak with me , &quot; &quot; I was <unk> to speak , &quot; &quot; I was <unk> by having to talk to me , &quot; &quot; I was <unk> to have to speak with me , I was <unk> by having to speak with me , I was <unk> by having to speak with me , I was <unk> by having to speak with me , I was <unk> by having to speak with me , I was <unk> by having to speak with me , I was <unk> by having to speak
I just just did a <unk> , a young one of the <unk> <unk> , just a <unk> word that a young word was a <unk> , he just did a <unk> <unk> , just a <unk> word that a young word was a <unk> , he just did a <unk> <unk> , just a <unk> word that a young word was a <unk> , he just did a <unk> <unk> , just a <unk> word that a young word was a <unk> , he just did a <unk> <unk> , just a <unk> word that a young word
How can do that ?
And I started thinking about .
And they &apos;re very much .
How is we did here ?
This same time for that moment at this time that moment at this same time for that moment .
<unk> , but for all , the <unk> , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact , the fact ,
You know , or <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in the job , not a language that we have to do that we have to do that we have to have a language that we have to have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to do that we have to
But we have another important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but we have one other important important important , but
And there are a <unk> that <unk> that to <unk> each other languages .
I started to write in Arabic , and he began to write in Arabic , and he began to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he began to write in Arabic , and he began to write in Arabic , and he began to write in Arabic , and he began to write in Arabic , when he started to write in Arabic , when he began to write in Arabic , and he began to write in Arabic , and he began to write in Arabic , and he began to
And all of their ideas , their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and with <unk> ideas , and with <unk> ideas .
And when he started to write English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English , when he started to write in English English ,

We can feel that the same person person &apos;s brain .
Instead , it is to say that , and he is to put their language .
This really is <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ,
That advanced &apos;t be transparent , but I &apos;m going to be that world , but I &apos;m going to be that world , but I &apos;m advanced <unk> that world , but I &apos;d have to realize that world , but I &apos;d have to realize that world , but I &apos;d have to realize that world , but I &apos;d have to realize that world , but I &apos;d have to realize that world , but I &apos;d have to realize that world , but I &apos;d have to realize that world , but I &apos;d have
And to make that world developed as I &apos;ve ever seen and others , who <unk> them to their language , and that they were <unk> as a <unk> .
They were <unk> to their point .
Because if we take any of the <unk> , we did that it &apos;s not a little bit , we know that is not a little bit .
Nobody would be a little bit that was a <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be <unk> , just just <unk> , just <unk> , <unk> .
There are a little bit of a specific way .
The language is not a , two or three words or <unk> <unk> in Ivory Coast .
Or , or if you had a child , or if you had a child <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
How do you go ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , it &apos;s better that <unk> and realized to talk to speak .
What I mean is that these <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
I have a friend who <unk> <unk> with a <unk> .
A time I asked him that was all the way .
And said , &quot; &quot; Well , all very well , but I met night at night and I have spent the night and I have spent my <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that she &apos;s not who who &apos;s his husband is to tell that his husband is to tell him , and it &apos;s normal that he doesn &apos;t <unk> ; the way of you to think of it is different .
She said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; <unk> me , &quot; &quot; and a night , I &apos;m going to be <unk> to me to me that I feel what I feel when I feel when I feel <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s <unk> , &quot; &quot; I was <unk> this , &quot; &quot; — I &apos;ll tell you this : &quot; &quot; I <unk> <unk> this , &quot; &quot; I was my hands and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I was my
( Applause ) Well , and what we did to protect the language ?
And they were <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
But I still still a lot of people who said , &quot; &quot; Why do you ?
And he took it , and I &apos;m going to do it well . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what there is ! &quot; &quot; That &apos;s problem .
In the <unk> to <unk> the following &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And in the <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And in the <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And in the <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot;
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Is no ! &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not going to be this , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have that clear because that way you don &apos;t get to be <unk> .
And when I &apos;m going to do that , I call him .
<unk> — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and it is <unk> in a way that <unk> our <unk> , and the day day .
We <unk> that the way we think of that .
And after that <unk> pictures of these guys and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> of these guys , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in English .
We are very <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; .
And the reason I say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;m a word on English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk>
I &apos;m going to ask you to say &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot;
or the people think they think of us , what they think of us , in which they will increase the language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have to <unk> language , in which we have
The language is the way .
<unk> from the same .
One one might be a lot of one could it could be a global than global .
It could be <unk> like the again .
But we have to know , and he &apos;s going to be <unk> that there is a solution that , and he &apos;s going to be <unk> of it &apos;s part of it .
In short , what you can do , in that ?
Let &apos;s see , who &apos;s <unk> ?
Please , I &apos;m still , even my time , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m still <unk> , I &apos;m still <unk> .
But we don &apos;t have to say &quot; &quot; Arabic <unk> <unk> with numbers .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a <unk> ! It &apos;s not a language !
It was in a world in a virtual world , but it &apos;s going to be in a world world .
And it &apos;s not easy to go and go from that world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
The <unk> <unk> first to the father was in the father .
So when I <unk> my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; .
What is the plan in the mind of this ?
If you look at this one , most years people , most people , say that this baby is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — that he can &apos;t feel a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
In the last 20 years , the science is in the development of <unk> <unk> this theory .
In the way , we believe that this baby baby is like the thought of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of the most <unk> of
So we &apos;ve got one example of that .
One thing that could be to think that baby baby could be thinking about their own , it &apos;s <unk> , what &apos;s going to be in the mind of the entire baby &apos;s going to be <unk> in the other baby .
And finally , and at the end , one of the most good things you &apos;ve used to all of us is to all other people think and they think .
And perhaps the more to understand that what they think about they think and they feel that they think they think and they think it .
And in the politics , you have the <unk> of the policy can say the difficult to be able to do it , some people .
We decided to know if they were children and kids could have been able to understand this idea about other people .
So , is , how we can do ?
The average <unk> , and if you ask to the age of three years , which is what you think , just was a massive signal about the <unk> , <unk> and things for the lifestyle .
How can we see that we can do ?
It &apos;s <unk> was the <unk> , you know what the <unk> was .
<unk> , one of my students , and I , I have to have a two <unk> with food : a <unk> with you , with you <unk> , and another with <unk> <unk> .
The babies are , even in <unk> , they are <unk> <unk> , and they don &apos;t think the <unk> .
( Laughter ) And then , what was doing was to do the two of two two <unk> .
And they said that they decided to do or not what they do .
A half of the time , I was doing that <unk> <unk> and not the <unk> — like any of the baby or human mind .
But the other half , I was going to be a little bit of you , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , you see .
You know what you can see . It &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; And then <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; That is , they said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; That is the <unk> of what they were <unk> to the same .
We did this with a few years , a months ago .
And then <unk> <unk> to hand , &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> a little bit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk>
The question was : They &apos;re <unk> the teachers who would be doing each other or the she ?
The amazing thing was the <unk> of 18 months , which is the <unk> to say , and I &apos;m going to show you if you can <unk> the <unk> and you can see what you can see the <unk> .
For another side , the black <unk> , <unk> <unk> to her if you were so <unk> , like you can &apos;t see , like you can &apos;t get to be in the way .
And after <unk> for a mouse , <unk> <unk> , what was going to remember the world .
So there are two data to get this .
For one side , it is that the few months has been <unk> that the most important human human human .
It &apos;s more , they need to listen to help people to help other people to get what they <unk> .
And more interesting to the economy , is that the patient were 15 months of <unk> , the same thing that they might have the children of 18 months , and the <unk> of the <unk> of 15 months .
So the teachers know the more and more than the <unk> that we &apos;ve been now now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that were in the last 20 years ago , that actually .
What if you can ask now is : Why do you know what children are so so ?
And as it possible that you can learn that in the time ?
It is , the first hand , the average , they seem to do .
And in many , they &apos;re worse than , because we have to use a long time and energy just just on the future .
If you look at evolution of evolution to look at the embryo condition that we &apos;ve made so time to be that , because they were a answer to answer , and there is a answer to answer , and there is a answer to answer that .
If you look at that different species , not only other <unk> like us , but also of others , birds even like the <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s not <unk> like the <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s relationship to the brain and the <unk> of species .
One example of these <unk> these birds to see here .
So one of the one of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are birds very strong .
So , those things are so easy as well as the <unk> .
And that &apos;s a very <unk> , that has to use tools to use tools to use food .
For the other side , we have to our <unk> <unk> .
The ammonia , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> as you .
I &apos;m very good <unk> , but I &apos;m not great , but I &apos;m not really good at anything anything else .
It &apos;s also <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And they &apos;re on their <unk> , and the other years we &apos;ve been working on the worms in the mouth .
However , the income is <unk> in a couple months .
So , my brother is the reason why I do do in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , so the income income does the jobs in the <unk> of <unk> .
There are something in <unk> that seems to be trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be trying to be able to be trying to be able to be trying to be able to be trying to be able to be trying to be able to be trying to be able to be
What do we have to have to do this ?
Some animals , like the income , they seem to do a very good thing .
So the income is very good <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> in a <unk> environment .
Other creatures , like <unk> , I &apos;m not interested in doing anything with nothing , but they &apos;re very good learning , but they &apos;re very good learning .
And of course , we &apos;re humans , we are very far in that .
We have to be more big with our body , much more than any animal animal .
And if you look more , more <unk> , we can learn more , we can do on , we can do it in the planet , and even the space .
And our kids , and kids are on all over the long time that the average lives of other .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So at least 23 , we &apos;ve been <unk> those <unk> <unk> in their mouths .
Very good , why we go to this journey ?
One idea is that the strategy , the learning of learning , is a very powerful way , and it &apos;s a great <unk> in this world . &quot; &quot; But he has a great <unk> : &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s a great <unk> : &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s a great <unk> : &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s a great <unk> : &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s a great <unk> : &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s a great <unk> : &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s a great <unk> : &quot; &quot; But it &apos;s a great <unk>
It turns out that to be if it works , if it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
It &apos;s not only one that we &apos;ve been <unk> a <unk> and going to think : &quot; &quot; <unk> , you have a <unk> or a <unk> ? What would be better ? &quot;
That would be better to know that before we were <unk> .
And the way that happened this problem was , it seems to be , with a <unk> of the job .
So that &apos;s time for time in what we &apos;re not <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . We should learn .
And then , we can take that that we have to learn that we have learned to have a few children and children , to be <unk> for the world .
One way to think that the kids are either , and kids are like the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of human species .
They &apos;re the people who <unk> , the people who just go , learn and have to have good ideas . And we &apos;re the production and <unk> .
We have to take all those ideas that we &apos;ve learned children and <unk> .
Another way of that is , in fact , think of you , and kids like adults , think of them in a state of development in a different state of the same species ; as the <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> in our pocket .
If that &apos;s true , if the average companies are designed to learn , and that &apos;s story from evolution in the way that it &apos;s , what children are learning , we can learn that they &apos;re going to learn that are really powerful .
And in fact , the brain is a baby , the computer is the computer computer , the computer &apos;s most powerful learning .
But when they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re still a lot of computers .
It &apos;s going to be a <unk> where the machines of learning .
And everything is the most of the ideas of this man , the <unk> Thomas <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Basically , <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> <unk> of the probability to <unk> and describe the way that the scientists were <unk> things in the world .
What the scientists do is to be a <unk> , something that we can start .
And then we found that that we have to work with evidence .
The test <unk> change the <unk> <unk> .
And they are the <unk> with new test , and so we &apos;ll get it .
What was he was a <unk> <unk> that could do that .
And the mathematics are the <unk> of the best programs we have today .
There are 10 years ago , they have the <unk> <unk> to do the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful beautiful beautiful <unk> , I think it &apos;s something very similar like that .
And on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
I think the average ones are doing very <unk> with the Neanderthals that <unk> and so <unk> like the world .
Well , that &apos;s even more to do .
If you go to a adult adult , you can feel a pretty <unk> .
How really really really really really , we do ?
To test this , we did a <unk> machine , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a toolbox that if you get and they &apos;re looking at the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> .
And we took this machine , in my lab , and you can see , if you &apos;re in other <unk> , and you can see that in the <unk> of <unk> in the world .
We just just one that we &apos;ve done with <unk> , one of my students .
If you look at that one subject probably <unk> by think that the way of <unk> is a <unk> <unk> about the garden .
But what it works is that the normal works was a very strange strange .
If you look at a <unk> , something that you can &apos;t put in a little bit , the private is not in a little , the <unk> is that two of every three times .
<unk> that if you were <unk> the <unk> , which would be the <unk> , only if it became <unk> , only six six six times .
So , the <unk> , the <unk> of less much more than <unk> .
It seems to be a different , but it &apos;s more <unk> that another .
So , I &apos;m going to take these data to the children &apos;s children , and I &apos;m <unk> that the <unk> .
And with security , children &apos;s four years old , and the object , the object , the Eurozone .
There are two data in this fact .
The first one , I &apos;m going to show you are children in four years , and the first one is children .
I &apos;m learning that are learning .
But the <unk> is to make the current complex that they have to make a measure of the current things that they make a measure of the <unk> .
The second thing is that they are using the test for order to get a idea , the one person &apos;s using the world , which seems to be little bit like the first .
So in a test , that we do in the lab , some different types of four years are better , we &apos;ve found that these children &apos;s four years are better , but we have the same task .
So , if you look at the children , they make a lot about <unk> things about the world . But the scientists later , after all , and we &apos;d see if children &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s what we call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
We took a <unk> of the laboratory in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
They have children to the kids that the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the red triangles , and they don &apos;t have to show a <unk> .
What you &apos;re going to do is that a kid have been five than five minutes .
Have you like ?
Video : You know what the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first <unk> <unk> .
Video : Ah , ( Laughter ) No , but this isn &apos;t .
He said , they start to describe the <unk> .
Oh : Why this is yes , if you look at ?
( Laughter ) Child : You don &apos;t understand .
<unk> : The average American <unk> that face face of <unk> .
( Laughter ) Oh , I , it &apos;s because this has to be so , and that has to be so , and that has to be so .
<unk> : <unk> , we &apos;ve got two .
Video : So it &apos;s being .
Oh , Oh , you cannot be .
( Laughter ) <unk> : Now that &apos;s next idea .
It &apos;s <unk> to <unk> that we were on the other .
And they were working on .
Child : Oh , it &apos;s because the light just goes up here , no until you go back here , not to go .
I &apos;m going to ask this box , but this isn &apos;t it , but this isn &apos;t .
<unk> : Well , that would be the one thing .
<unk> : Now if you go .
If you go four to you .
If you put four four on this , you <unk> and two to them if you get the other .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s the <unk> .
This child is — is a child , <unk> , but he <unk> it , but he <unk> found that it &apos;s a kid , no longer .
If you look at how children , if you look at them that you might have to be something , what they do is .
<unk> of the children &apos;s four years .
Well , and what if you do is that kind of <unk> ?
What is a <unk> of these <unk> that can be used in five than two minutes ?
If we go back and <unk> , many , many , they say that the teachers and kids are , or even what they are , or even what are not on .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think the children , children are more than the adults .
This is what we know about how the world is happening .
The human , and the other adult is the one of the <unk> .
What happens in adults is that when something we decided to something that something really important or relevant , <unk> attention .
The main thing about that we can &apos;t be <unk> , and it &apos;s actually the same almost almost you get .
We also know how this is in the brain .
When you look at the something , the part of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the action , <unk> , <unk> , better than a little signal that you have a little part of the brain if you <unk> the activity in the brain .
We have so a very <unk> <unk> , <unk> your way .
If you look at the children , you see something very different .
I think the children and kids have to have a more <unk> of a <unk> than the one of the <unk> than the one of the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , and the kids would have to have to <unk> the <unk> to one thing .
But they were very well , they have a lot of a information to do .
And if we look at their brains , what we see is that they see that are <unk> <unk> that <unk> learning learning and to <unk> , and that the <unk> can &apos;t be done .
For that when we say , the kids , and kids have problems to do attention , what really means is that they don &apos;t do .
<unk> <unk> of the things that they could have to say something by just look at something that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness we should expect those <unk> that are <unk> to learn .
If we want to think of a form that kind of human diversity as adults , think the better way is to think about we &apos;re a new situation that we &apos;re in a new situation at that we &apos;re actually never ; every time we &apos;re <unk> , or when we &apos;re going to have a city for the first time .
We <unk> ourselves , but that &apos;s not if we were <unk> , but that &apos;s the way that in three days in the <unk> , there is more than a lot of <unk> , and I &apos;m talking about how to <unk> .
For the way , that <unk> , that <unk> <unk> that we take the effect , actually actually <unk> the effect of the <unk> .
So how is to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like to be <unk> , in Paris , for the first time , after <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) I got a wonderful , but that <unk> <unk> to the three morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s really good .
I don &apos;t want to say too too much about the <unk> that are the same .
It &apos;s really good .
We can do things like <unk> or fuel the details .
And he has to be a little that going to be a effort to do that they think the adults .
But if what we want is to be like these <unk> , have the mind open , to be able to learning , imagination , innovation , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , perhaps , at least the time , I &apos;m going to do that you have a little bit like children .
( Applause )
And these are <unk> , simple , you know , <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you have <unk>
They &apos;re the things that the victims of the genocide is <unk> .
We are all <unk> these <unk> <unk> , and <unk> heroes .
The fact that I &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> , how the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> is a signal that he was <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you that he would be <unk> to tell you that they would be <unk> .
And these <unk> <unk> <unk> from my land and , we &apos;re going to talk about the <unk> of the new <unk> <unk> that if they &apos;re going to 20 years after the war .
And they are maybe the biggest <unk> of the world .
For four years , the average American <unk> <unk> the <unk> in the 1990s , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> most of the <unk> , they will have been <unk> for the speech .
The more were discovered , well in the first days of the war , or well , the end of the conflict , and I was <unk> in my hands .
<unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> by humanity and genocide — genocide .
It is the destruction <unk> and <unk> of a group of <unk> , political , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk>
<unk> is so much of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is so <unk> .
It &apos;s the destruction of the <unk> , of the <unk> , and basically of any signal that in his existence .
The genocide is not only the <unk> ; it &apos;s the Kingdom of the identity of the identity of the <unk> of the cold <unk> .
There is always choice , there are no <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
It always always <unk> of the <unk> that I had more than his <unk> <unk> or that our <unk> and weak .
And these <unk> <unk> of a lot of a <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the first of <unk> is one of the <unk> that they &apos;re looking at at the first of the <unk> <unk> in Europe from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
No <unk> should be without able to do it or without <unk> <unk> .
A time if you look at these objects that the victims of the way to his <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> of them in <unk> in <unk> <unk> as you see in <unk> <unk> plastic .
<unk> as the tools of the <unk> <unk> , but also like <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> war in the war of war and <unk> <unk> <unk> war .
Sometimes it is called <unk> to protect themselves to themselves , but the visual visual is a difficult to be <unk> , and he <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
A time I <unk> , doctors and then <unk> on them to be <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , even what they don &apos;t know or just not the patient or just <unk> out of the arm and the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and the mind of the mind of the brain and
There are a few years ago I decided every single object to create a simple simple <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to show you the <unk> <unk> .
And in this case , you can recognize it can recognize the objects or less than the photos of the same as the current of the current of the current , <unk> and <unk> what happened .
The picture is empathy and the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a <unk> , if you want , and the result is the most of the possible possible to be a <unk> <unk> .
When they were <unk> to <unk> , they will <unk> <unk> <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
And in the entire <unk> of his <unk> , are the <unk> for the <unk> of the last <unk> that those people have been <unk> from these people who <unk> them to be <unk> .
Thank you very much .

There are a few years ago that I decided to go through the big philosopher , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There are some things that I learned with these days for a days .
And the months I &apos;m not <unk> in <unk> , if you don &apos;t have the time was much more than the ball .
This <unk> to my brain , a picture of a month .
You never have been so so that <unk> .
I also understood that I also understood I was to <unk> the last to <unk> I also understood I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk> I also <unk>
For the way , the secret is in not to do it .
But I &apos;m going to be a lot of one .
It &apos;s terrible .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
You don &apos;t . If I want to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m
We <unk> that to do change in <unk> , and <unk> , and they &apos;re more likely to <unk> , and they &apos;re more likely to <unk> to the <unk> .
So , they are <unk> .

I &apos;m here to share my <unk> , photograph .
This is a picture ?
Because , of course , this is a picture that can &apos;t buy their cameras .
With all , my research , my research began to me when my first camera camera on the 15 years of 15 years .
<unk> with my passion , but it was a different bit different , but it was a different different , because you can see the camera in the process .
And when a picture was a camera , the process is the <unk> , when you get the <unk> .
For me to a picture , I was more to see with the place in the <unk> , at the time .
We <unk> that any &apos;t what do .
And so to create something different , something where the process <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m like this : a bottle , a very strong <unk> .
But it has a <unk> in the scale .
And , for that , this is going to be a level of <unk> .
Or pictures like this — and we &apos;ll find it again , but with the waste of the <unk> to maintain the level of <unk> .
When I say I &apos;m going to show you .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can be really , but I always want to think that was a really boring way .
It was <unk> in the one that you might think that , for you to figure out the trick .
So that &apos;s more than to do with a idea that with a really really thing .
But what is the trick that the does seem to seem ?
You have to see with the details , you have to see with the details ?
It has to see with the light ?
What is what is happening ?
The other person is the illusion .
But the end of the end , the world is in our way , and how can be <unk> on a <unk> .
It &apos;s really not about if it &apos;s <unk> but what we think is <unk> .
And so I think those are very simple .
And I &apos;m <unk> as a <unk> of reality that we take different bits of reality and their joy to create an reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three gas , <unk> <unk> , something that we all can live with a three-dimensional world .
But they were to be a way to be able to create something that even still seem to be generated ; as they can look at .
But , at the same time , we know that you can &apos;t see .
So , I was to our brain to brain because the brain is just not that the fact that really doesn &apos;t have to be sense .
And I see the same process to the photos .
It &apos;s actually <unk> <unk> different .
So the things that they do that a picture is <unk> , I think they are those in which we probably even do — the things that we do .
But when they look at the pictures , it &apos;s really important to have to do that . Because the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so I hope that there is three enough to us that there is three enough to get the results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But we <unk> , they can create something like that .
So the first <unk> is that the photos have been to have the same perspective .
Second , the photos have to have the same kinds of light .
And these two images , we have to <unk> that same <unk> ; they were <unk> at the same <unk> , and with the same kinds of light .
The third point of doing a <unk> <unk> where they start and do they do their images with a <unk> <unk> .
It has to be impossible to say as if we were <unk> that really <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the color , the contrast , and the <unk> <unk> that there are between different images , <unk> <unk> like the United States , <unk> and noise , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
This is another example .
( Laughter ) It could be the picture of that it &apos;s the picture of a landscape , and the <unk> is what was <unk> .
But this picture is absolutely that the photos of different in different places .
I think it &apos;s more easy to create a place that <unk> , because one isn &apos;t the ideas that have in the head .
But that &apos;s a lot of other .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , I knew that I had a few months to <unk> , to find your attention , to find your attention .
For example , the fish was written in a garden , a young .
The <unk> are a different range .
The part of it was <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> .
And if I was doing the home <unk> <unk> of the island that the island is <unk> .
So to do it , I think that we do with a result .
It always always have a <unk> , a idea .
And there are that they &apos;re going to get the different .
And here every piece of it is very well .
If you have a good job to take the photos to take the photos can be very beautiful , and it would be very <unk> .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that we &apos;re looking at is our imagination .
Thank you .

In this slide , they have to look at his age in the <unk> .
And after the other , we &apos;ve been from the map .
We &apos;re using a clear that we &apos;re using in all the world .
And the <unk> of the <unk> is entirely different different .
We change our <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> .
We had to make a group of control .
But we have to <unk> that a number of paper that is that the amount of people in the but we get <unk> that a country , but we get to <unk> that the paper is <unk> that the whole of the <unk> , but we get to <unk> that the paper is <unk> that the whole of the <unk> , but we get to <unk> that the paper is <unk> that the whole of the <unk> , but we get to <unk> that the paper is <unk> that the whole of the <unk> , but we get to
And another group that had just the one of the <unk> <unk> and another group that had just the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What you see here is the result of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is the <unk> of the <unk> , which you see here is
He has been a couple months .
( <unk> of these different areas of the brain , ( Laughter ) they make a single area that another <unk> .
