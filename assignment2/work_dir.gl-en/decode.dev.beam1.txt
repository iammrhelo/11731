( <unk> ) <unk> on <unk> , <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> in a family of a half a half of a child .
My mother was five years when I was his father , but when I <unk> , he was a man of <unk> .
If their kids were children or girls , they will be to get to school .
So I guess I &apos;m going to show you .
My mother was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we &apos;re working on five percent <unk> , we &apos;re getting five .
And I can imagine that that I had to do when was the same time .
<unk> , I knew , I was going to be <unk> by the <unk> , or kids , kids just <unk> a <unk> .
At that moment , when I was a high school , I wanted to be <unk> .
I want to be <unk> to help , help women and kids .
So I &apos;m going to tell my education , but I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in my country , there was no <unk> to women on the <unk> so that , I still <unk> in the school of medicine , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father is <unk> .
And I went to America for America .
I <unk> my studies .
Whereas my education , I learned my country , I was <unk> my country .
You know , when I was my <unk> , I was my <unk> , I was my <unk> , and my country .
I &apos;m <unk> months , and I didn &apos;t know it .
My family <unk> in a field of <unk> .
So in the case I had the <unk> <unk> in my family .
I want to have to be the right .
But where I was my heart ?
My brain was in Afghanistan .
We all the days , when I <unk> the news , when I was <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> in my country , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go back back to my country , but , at the same time , I knew that I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
They live to live with them .
So , and it was all so happy .
I was <unk> to my head .
So we took the field in <unk> .
And when I go to the field of <unk> , there was seven million and a half of <unk> , <unk> million and half a half of <unk> .
<unk> , at the 90 percent were women and children , most of the men or they were in the war or they know ?
And so we have to do that <unk> <unk> , <unk> with things that don &apos;t get to be <unk> .
I was a <unk> with a <unk> , a children , there &apos;s a number of five and eight kids , there was a <unk> , without knowing what do .
And I had a woman that I didn &apos;t have to be , without any <unk> , no <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re not a place in what .
I had a student who have lost their parents , their <unk> and they have to have 10 years old , they had to take their families , to be the head of family and try to protect their own own , their kids , and kids .
The one was absolutely <unk> .
My <unk> is <unk> by my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So that moment , I was a different .
So that moment , I mean , I can do why do these people ?
How can I do ?
I &apos;m a person , I can do by them ?
But at that moment , I knew that my life began to my life .
<unk> . We got a position .
<unk> trust . I &apos;m going to trust a career .
I &apos;m going to show you to me my family , my family , my family , to my family , to the other country , to the other .
And at that moment I knew what was my <unk> , I was education and health and that was what we &apos;ve been done .
But they think that was easy ?
Well , I didn &apos;t know , in , the women didn &apos;t have access to the education .
In addition , after the <unk> in February , people have no <unk> in no one .
It was very hard to say , &quot; &quot; I want to do that &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; Who are me ?
Has that comes from the United States .
Has anyone who was going to be here .
I was <unk> on me ? &quot; &quot; Of course I don &apos;t .
And so what was really was to do was to trust with trust this community .
How do I do that ?
I went to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to ask you .
In the end , I have to a man .
He had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
And I went to her head in the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you a professor , &quot; &quot; I want to say a professor . &quot;
And he <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I think I can be a professor ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> you , like you think I can be a professor ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> you , &quot; &quot; <unk> my <unk> , &quot; &quot; Oh , my <unk> <unk> , I was <unk> to the voice .
So , at a year , we have a <unk> schools , 15 kids , 15 kids going to school , and he was amazing .

&quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; We know that the school <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; What do you ? &quot; &quot; And , you know , <unk> and I asked , &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; What ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And he &apos;s going to go home and said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re my house . I &apos;m going to show my hands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I looked at my home and said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot;
You have a students . We all have the Koran , the book .
You know ? The Koran says that if you were <unk> my book , you can be good <unk> , and you can put your own <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they &apos;re <unk> their <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they &apos;re <unk> a thing : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to be a thing : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to show you a thing : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to be a thing , I &apos;m going to
They <unk> each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re good . &quot; &quot; And they know , he &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they know , they &apos;d got me to another text .
And my personal personal <unk> , my office .
They were very dead language .
They don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t know .
They don &apos;t know why I don &apos;t want to do with them .
However , all they were <unk> from the whole of the <unk> .
Very <unk> and , of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) Of course , we were alive .
But it also , they also <unk> <unk> during the <unk> of <unk> , when the <unk> were the power was another story .
<unk> in the <unk> and <unk> the 80 of an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> without <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> , we were in the country , we have a school after another .
They have been <unk> of a lot of children .
They were <unk> without <unk> without .
We work with women and children .
<unk> about health <unk> .
We give many types of <unk> , many types of <unk> and can imagine how many kinds of people can imagine .
I was very happy . I was going to be with my job , I was going to be with my job .
And one day , when I was trying to <unk> four and with a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a more , <unk> , <unk> , a more <unk> , <unk> .
With it back to me , <unk> the road .
I was <unk> to my driver that he was <unk> and <unk> : &quot; We don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not nothing to see . &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; My <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t see it , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; My <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t see it , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; My <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t see it , &quot;
What you want ? &quot; &quot; They said that anything , and they do .
At that moment , the women will be in the car .
I &apos;m very <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot; &quot; This is the end .
This time , <unk> to all of all .
And I had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment , the moment , I grew up on the everything that you think , and what do you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
<unk> on your <unk> and you can see that .
So I was going to be a <unk> of the car .
My <unk> and I went from the car .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What I can <unk> ? &quot; &quot; You know what I was going to do ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know that &apos;s .
We know where it &apos;s going to do .
We took all the days of a place in the other days .
<unk> women , <unk> and also have to be the chance to have a job .
<unk> . What about it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
What we are going to do ? &quot; &quot; We said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; Is it .
What we know , the only one we can do , for time in what we can live , is to <unk> a weapon , and kill .
We don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; And you know what means .
And they were a <unk> .
And they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll hear you , &quot; &quot; <unk> to you , &quot; &quot; I have to give you , &quot; &quot; I sat on the car , I sat on the car , I sat down to the <unk> . &quot; &quot; So , we are <unk> .
We just had money to get the metals , for them , to school , and even more .
When I go to office , obviously all the <unk> , I can &apos;t get <unk> .
They <unk> their own . No .
My <unk> was the only one that was there and I would be there , I would be there , I was going to be there .
I was <unk> , my wife , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do ? &quot; &quot; How we &apos;ll be able to do ? &quot; &quot; How we &apos;ll be able to be able to do that problem ?
Because we have to understand education in the northern .
Hundreds of the women who were <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , they were <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , they were <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , they were <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , they were <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , they were <unk> from the <unk> of
So he was there , and , and , we &apos;re now , now , we &apos;re here talking about , because , at that moment , one of my <unk> , <unk> a girl .
And we said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I rolled up . &quot; &quot; And I grew up .
He said , &quot; &quot; You are you , &quot; &quot; You are you . What you say , &quot; &quot; No , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
It was the way that I was <unk> , I don &apos;t think , and he was going to ask .
&quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you . &quot;
It &apos;s all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Well , for the next , you go and <unk> them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when I did , I did the same way , you know the same way , they know what ? That was not there , they were a little more far , the same kids , and they &apos;re <unk> the car .
So I &apos;d like to the car .
<unk> and I said , &quot; &quot; Is it well , &quot; &quot; Is you , &quot; &quot; Is you , &quot; &quot; Is you . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Is you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And
So the last <unk> and to <unk> , they were <unk> , they were <unk> teachers .
Now they are the best , and they are the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they are the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they are the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they are the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they are the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they are the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they are the best , but they &apos;re the best , but they are
They have English , learning how to be teachers , trying to live and they &apos;re my <unk> .
The other we don &apos;t know , in the <unk> , they don &apos;t know , in the mountain , they come up with your eyes and go .
And they <unk> .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That means that the education is to change the people .
When we <unk> people , they were change , they change , we need to work that .
You cannot &apos;t put the women and <unk> of men , because men are the people who have been <unk> into more difficult to change .
( Laughter ) So that we started to <unk> , because they might be the potential to <unk> , because the same potential have to take the same jobs , which they can do themselves with the same way they have .
So they &apos;re <unk> men and I think I was working on and I think I was working on the <unk> and I think of them and I think I was going to show you and I think I was going to show you and I think I was going to show you and I think I was going to show you and I think I was going to show you and I think I was going to show you and I think I was going to show you and I think I was going to show you and
I live alive in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful country , and I &apos;m going to show you .
It &apos;s actually <unk> all the parts of the parts .
Women Are education : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — and they were going to go home to another .
They don &apos;t get the red triangles .
But I know that happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t go out if you can go up without the problems of security .
But we still want to get the waste .
And I want to show you another another part .
Now , women are very hard to work , very hard .
<unk> . They &apos;re going to be <unk> .
They were <unk> to be <unk> , again .
They were <unk> to be <unk> and <unk> .
So , it &apos;s a kind of <unk> , and people do all the way they use their potential and all of it .
I want to be honest with you , because of love , through trust and honesty , and I hope .
If they have these things , you need to be successful .
We have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He said that if if it has compassion and if it has love , you can see the world .
And we <unk> , we were able to do .
And if we were able to Afghanistan , I &apos;m going to be a 100 percent of which any any can happen in the world .
Thank you , many , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
There are 10 years ago I got a <unk> that changed my life .
So , I was <unk> in the <unk> of the University of Los Angeles , Los Angeles .
And they were asked me to a <unk> of <unk> Los Angeles .
A old <unk> <unk> with <unk> and <unk> <unk> that would be a <unk> of brain .
<unk> if I could go back to the <unk> of the <unk> , we could have to be a possible for a possible .
We <unk> <unk> of <unk> that the U.S. in the United States with <unk> <unk> , and <unk> that <unk> <unk> to the same patients .
But sometimes , I &apos;m going to go to the community of medical , especially to some medical medical medical care , especially to some medical medical records , but to get a medical medical <unk> , especially to some medical medical medical especially .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the case that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> that the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> his heart .
And that process , we have to be able to live a lot of patients , was <unk> , with the bacteria that <unk> and glue .
We put symptoms , and they &apos;re trying to learn my patients , and they &apos;re trying to do that , for their patients .
And in time , in the same day , she was going to send up the Center from the <unk> Medical <unk> and in Los Angeles .
And I started to see that clearly , one thing .
So , doctors and the doctors has been <unk> the same way of their patients and animals , <unk> <unk> <unk> , of the brain , <unk> , diabetes , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk>
Well , I have to have a <unk> .
But I still have <unk> <unk> and biology and biology and <unk> and <unk> for my <unk> , even I was my <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and that &apos;s more about the entire <unk> of <unk> , and human what was a <unk> of attention , and human what &apos;s human beings , and human , and human , <unk> are <unk> so that &apos;s animals .
And I started to <unk> as I could be , with all those <unk> , that never never have to be a <unk> or <unk> <unk> to have a <unk> to have another perspective on one of my patients ?
You have never to have a conference ?
But more , what should be <unk> ?
We all doctors have a different connections between animals and human beings .
All the drugs that we &apos;ve been doing , we take , who we take , that we can take our families on a animal .
But there is a great difference between to the one of a drug or <unk> a drug or <unk> a human disease , and that animal <unk> by the same <unk> .
If it &apos;s part of the surprise of the <unk> , the world does between the <unk> and the <unk> wouldn &apos;t .
We &apos;ve heard of these kids , they think the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of a chemical <unk> .
The individuals in today , we &apos;re looking at every day , and we &apos;ve learned every more <unk> of technology .
And that creates a gap , we can see between patients that are <unk> and the patients that live in the ocean , in <unk> and in <unk> .
But I think there &apos;s still a more further than on the past .
At the doctors and the scientists have <unk> that our species , the <unk> , is just a more <unk> , and more more than any other .
But in our brain , we didn &apos;t just just just get it .
I &apos;m going to remember the same thing when I was Mozart or I watch my <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I think that &apos;s called <unk> human human , even <unk> the <unk> <unk> as a single single <unk> , to the part .
Well , but this is <unk> .
Now , when I see a patient , I always asked me , what I asked , what the doctors are doing ? &quot;
And , I could have to make a better , and it &apos;s actually could make a better , the <unk> as a human , the <unk> as a human , ?
And I &apos;m going to show you some of the <unk> and I &apos;m going to have this kind of <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> that <unk> .
( year ) ( <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot; they found &quot; &quot;
It was <unk> in a song where you have the savings rate of all the life in a <unk> <unk> , in a <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> .
But it turns out that this is , &quot; &quot; The human <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> human , and it &apos;s not the human .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , trying to protect symptoms <unk> , and even <unk> symptoms , <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , from <unk> , from the <unk> of <unk> .
How many lives , if you could have been if you look at the <unk> of the doctors , and the <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some patients have to be able to do themselves .
<unk> that if you want to see .
Some patients are also if they can <unk> themselves .
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and again , until you <unk> .
But the <unk> of these very <unk> and <unk> <unk> and even prevent the <unk> in the animals that they were <unk> like that .
You don &apos;t want to be that knowledge of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the patients are <unk> with the <unk> ?
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
For the little , at the <unk> , some women <unk> in the depression , for times as a severe <unk> states .
You can &apos;t have to his own son , and in <unk> , they &apos;ll get to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> know they also know that when you were <unk> , little after <unk> , can <unk> their <unk> , and in some cases , and in some cases , we &apos;ve been to <unk> , and in some cases , <unk> to <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> to make this <unk> <unk> syndrome , <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is the hormone <unk> , and that is that the <unk> is a <unk> in your <unk> .
You don &apos;t want to be this information to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , of the doctors and the patients that they will be used and <unk> <unk> ?
The fact that &apos;s all the <unk> that is all this , the gap between our body is that big .
For <unk> , so I &apos;m going to be able to have to put some some of them in the evidence .
There are doctors who can be <unk> <unk> with the <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> in a medical degree .
I mean , <unk> and psychologists , and we &apos;ve got to <unk> .
Of course , the biggest part of the doctors is not not enough idea that it &apos;s more hard to have to be today , and that when we go to build a medical <unk> than a medical than a medical <unk> than a medical medical than a medical medical than a medical <unk> than a medical medical than a medical medical than a medical <unk> than a medical medical than a medical <unk> than a medical medical than a medical <unk> than a medical medical than a medical <unk> than a medical medical than a medical <unk> than
So I don &apos;t know the <unk> of <unk> , I <unk> <unk> and <unk> of my <unk> <unk> .
So here is a huge punchline of the <unk> : How is that you call the one <unk> that just know how to do a species ?
And in the <unk> , this is a blind , and I &apos;m going to learn through <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> that you &apos;ve learned the <unk> in animals and <unk> and <unk> our <unk> and our <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> our <unk> and Hall .
And through the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , in the medical medical and <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the disease and the disorders of patients and animals .
So the <unk> <unk> , who starts learning how the treatment of a <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> , can help you to improve the best cancer , and how the people <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> , and how the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> can actually help to improve the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; and how the best <unk> <unk> of a <unk> can help to improve the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; and how the best <unk> <unk> of a <unk> can help to improve the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
So we <unk> , first <unk> , first in America , and now , in all the world , doctors and <unk> their <unk> , and <unk> as doctors , as the doctors , as doctors as doctors , as doctors as doctors .
In fact , we humans are also , humans are also animals , and because of us , and we have time to <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> of health <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> of health <unk> to <unk> all the species of the species that we have all the species .
Because it turns out that I have some of the best and the most <unk> is being <unk> by the doctors that have patients are patients that are patients .
And one of the best , the patient &apos;s patient &apos;s patient &apos;s actually actually actually really really important to how the other patients have the normal patients are involved , and they <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It is that it , right ?
( Laughter ) So here is , &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; . <unk> ! &quot; &quot; <unk> !
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> inside the brain , as you can imagine , and that you can imagine .
I don &apos;t know anything about the <unk> .
In contrast , when you have to <unk> , and when you have <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and when you have <unk> , and when you have <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and when you have <unk> , and when you have <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and when you have <unk> , and when you have <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and when you have <unk> , and when you have <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> , and
A life , the one of a human being , is <unk> by the data doctors : the <unk> <unk> , the U.K.
So , I was <unk> in a disease with legs .
The doctors start to speak a <unk> that you don &apos;t have to do .
And I &apos;m going to be a <unk> with your finger and your body <unk> .
People starts to change the <unk> because they &apos;re trying to do with Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What you said , &quot; &quot; What you do &quot; &quot; sh &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; As you , <unk> with questions for the people who have to answer .
<unk> of the guy , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to work with <unk> ?
I &apos;m trying to study ? &quot; &quot; We live to love ? &quot; &quot; We live creative ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What I did I was going to do that ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I can change something in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; There are <unk> something in my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; There are something that can do ?
There are some other option ? &quot; &quot; And , of course , doctors are all sorts of all these cases , because they are very <unk> and <unk> with <unk> .
But they also are very <unk> to do with patients , so I would say that the time they &apos;re learned about that to you , but a <unk> , in a patient , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means what you call &quot; &quot; .
( Laughter ) The things are <unk> but the main thing is that we &apos;ve been <unk> of any way in the <unk> , in your situation , in order to <unk> your family , or in <unk> a way of the <unk> of life to <unk> the risks that you &apos;re going to do .
But with all , I &apos;m going to see that in the hands of a series of <unk> <unk> , very <unk> .
Whereas was in the hospital , I asked me to me my <unk> of my <unk> <unk> .
It was very difficult to do , because it &apos;s not very powerful , a picture of your own <unk> .
I have to remember , and I said , &quot; &quot; All right , you might have no <unk> .
And I &apos;m more than this .
The cure , is what it will be , they &apos;re going to go to everything my being . &quot; &quot; So I looked at the next hospital , the medical <unk> of the hospital <unk> to the medical medical .
He was <unk> to change my relationship to the <unk> and he was going to learn more about it , so we could do something that we could do something that we can do as as a surgery .
I &apos;m <unk> , use a different types of technologies and information in my job .
So my great <unk> was <unk> , and that &apos;s information , and that do that we all could be that any could be that she &apos;s she .
So I went to a website called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he <unk> , I went to the <unk> . &quot;
And I had to <unk> that , but that one we can talk to get another talk .
( Laughter ) <unk> that word , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , because in <unk> , because in <unk> means that , &quot; &quot; and because of course , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and because in many of those cultures , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; can have a lot of the <unk> .
In our culture , it means to do a <unk> or to do it to the disease , but in other different , as the Kingdom of Asia , and in the Mediterranean , and the <unk> of Africa or Africa can &apos;t eat many other things .
And of course I &apos;ve been interested in the doctors and the other people of health , but also me feel interested in our health , but also me feel <unk> to me for the <unk> , by the same thing , or by the top .
It <unk> <unk> social <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all kinds of <unk> .
And it worked .
The whole thing is , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; she wrote the world .
I &apos;m very much attention to the ammonia and the <unk> and more <unk> people , with me on a little time through a little time through a little time through religion , but many more were about how people &apos;s doing the same way .
For example , I &apos;m going to show out those films , images , pictures and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have here for example of <unk> and his <unk> .
Or the <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> in my political tumor , and he <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
Now you can see you can have my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think about it , we can share the same thing .
And that was what I was going to do : Well , <unk> in medicine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all they are familiar with me to <unk> .
And we took all this information and support and I went to who a team of biological team , doctors , <unk> and hundreds of <unk> , and over hundreds of <unk> , I could talk about the information that I was probably , what &apos;s really important .
<unk> , we had to take a device of my own <unk> in different different , and they &apos;re <unk> through different cultures .
So the potential to <unk> the world and thousands of years , what I &apos;ve been learned quite amazing .
<unk> .
So I could give my time to get there .
I was the doctor with what I was working on , I was <unk> the hospital in what I wanted to be , and all the thousands of people were <unk> without feel me .
The world I knew I could be <unk> to <unk> the <unk> , and this is the most important part of <unk> <unk> .
What does the results ?
I &apos;m good , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) <unk> news after this facility : I have — wow — I had — a <unk> of very <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a kind of <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that doesn &apos;t much much .
I &apos;m going to be my life , and my lifestyle is to be a dream .
And it was very amazing , I was a <unk> of my head to <unk> to my brain in this side , to build a medical medical brain , to make a medical medical brain that the brain is .
And so just before the app , we could have been this , and we could determine this , and there was some that I could remember to realize that there was some of them .
And they &apos;re <unk> .
This <unk> was the very <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> people have changed their stories , their <unk> .
The doctors started talking to people who are not <unk> when it &apos;s not <unk> .
It &apos;s me to me , I &apos;m a state of translation between a different department , where the science is with you with the <unk> , and the <unk> with traditional <unk> .
And he <unk> to the <unk> <unk> was <unk> part of a truly society , and they start on the whole of the one of their individuals .
This is a <unk> world , my <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have no idea what we &apos;re playing .
You don &apos;t know what &apos;s until you do .
I &apos;m not <unk> that he was going to be something about music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I &apos;m listening to listen .
( Applause ) Now , before , I &apos;m nothing to <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> — ( Applause ) <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , ( Applause ) <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
The <unk> , as we call , is a space .
It &apos;s a place .
And one of the things that the bacteria do is that we don &apos;t think of that we don &apos;t think about that future , or in the past .
So you &apos;re alive at this moment .
There are to make a lot of choices when a kid is to <unk> .
We don &apos;t have the idea of what they were playing .
So , we did a common <unk> called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; But that might be sure or not .
You all know . We &apos;ve been <unk> . We all <unk> . We all all .
There is no time for the ideas .
So , the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s more easy to talk about the chance .
The way of <unk> a mistake when I &apos;m in <unk> — before nothing we see as a mistake , a mistake .
The only mistake we were <unk> in which they &apos;re not who who did .
Every monkey is a chance in the traditional .
They have to describe the <unk> that would be a funny note .
For example , if you look at a color , like <unk> , as you would have playing playing with <unk> , we could <unk> like this — and we &apos;d like to <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll be playing with <unk> , we might have <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll <unk> like this — and we &apos;ll <unk> like
( Applause ) If Christian &apos;s Canadian , like , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )
You see , all <unk> in the <unk> of colors .
If he &apos;s got a fun .
You see , it all <unk> in the inside of this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> — because of you just wanted to be <unk> , but he <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to see , let me see , let me do a point .
And we &apos;re going to get to get to <unk> .
And finally , Christian will find this picture .
And we don &apos;t go to the point .
I &apos;m going to show you for a second and then <unk> <unk> and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I &apos;m going to stop and I
Let &apos;s see that &apos;s what happens when we &apos;re doing with this <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> , someone could be <unk> as a mistake .
I just would say that if he &apos;s mistake if it comes to be if he doesn &apos;t get to him .
A chance to get .
So it &apos;s <unk> . Let &apos;s go up this again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we go , but something very good .
Let &apos;s take their ideas , or not .
( Applause ) Did you see their photo .
And I did a mystery .
This time the <unk> has changed in the stage .
It was a little more <unk> , a little more <unk> in the function of my answer .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is if you don &apos;t know , if every sentence is not the way , but not more to their own <unk> to <unk> the idea and we &apos;re not going to do .
This is really amazing .
It &apos;s a <unk> experience .
And I know I &apos;m talking to all the of the <unk> of course .
And we know that to be able to go to a <unk> and to do music is a <unk> .
And what &apos;s going to see that with the color of the <unk> ?
We all the traditional players , our <unk> is not the more of the most time to do .
( Laughter ) I just want to show you how the Higgs field .
And the other thing is we do we do <unk> in the traditional .
There are people who do .
But that &apos;s the cause the cause <unk> .
If you go to the side of the side that I want to do that , and I say that , and I say that , and I say that , and I say that I was going to be so , I say that , and I say that I was going to be so , I say that , and I say that I was going to be so , I say that , and I say that I was going to be so , I say that , and I say that I was going to
And it was to be something .
One , two , one , three , four .
( Applause ) It &apos;s a little bit , because I was going to be a <unk> because I was going to be <unk> .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; We <unk> on this side . &quot; &quot; If I want to <unk> music , the best I can do it , the best I can do it .
It &apos;s the science of the right .
It has more to see that I can &apos;t make that I can make .
If I want to show you a little level of <unk> , the first step to me , the first step to me is to be patient , listening to the point of that happened .
When you do , they <unk> and <unk> the other players and they get more likely to do it , and so it &apos;s going on .
See , one , one , one , three , four , four .
( Applause ) It &apos;s something entirely different when I &apos;ve learned my ideas .
It &apos;s much more sustainable . It has many more <unk> .
It &apos;s not about my vision , I &apos;m not about my vision , I don &apos;t .
They were <unk> to be at the moment , I put a other other people and to give them to creativity .
Thank you .
( Applause )
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the Internet doesn &apos;t get to the Internet Internet .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So about the crisis , the crisis <unk> <unk> .
because I just had 18 minutes , I &apos;m just 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to be 18
( Laughter )
And I think if people don &apos;t think the way they have to go more than to go .
And we have to solve with the same <unk> , and we have to solve with the same <unk> .
And as he said in that last days , as he was in the last days .

( Applause ) One of the biggest <unk> of the world and ( Applause )

We have to <unk> and that we can save our country , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
We &apos;ve been able to get to <unk> for <unk> for a <unk> that we give them to <unk> .
You might have to give the hand to hand if you start ?
And they have found that are extraordinary .
But there are things in education that have <unk> <unk> .
We all know that we were in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; always , I always had a <unk> . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always said , &quot; &quot; always , I always had a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; always , I always had a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; always , I always had a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; always , I always had a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; always , I always had a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said ,
There was a professor who didn &apos;t have to be in your head .
And I was my <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I was my <unk> , &quot; &quot; I was my <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I was
He said , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s now better opinion that I call the <unk> of me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and <unk> , and not the <unk> of the capacity , and not of the only one of the capacity to the ability to say , and not a single one of the capacity of the capacity .
It is the <unk> of what we can do for the capacity to be able to do why we do for our ability to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we can do for the capacity to do that we

( Applause )
And to do that in the right ?
( Applause )
I think more or less when you have to put the first <unk> to his first <unk> <unk> .
And if you &apos;re doing what the most <unk> , what if you do that you can see it &apos;s really , what the most of you do , what is you can see that if you think of the right , what you can do , what if you do .
You know , when you &apos;re doing something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t get something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t see something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that you can &apos;t do something that
We have to recognize that the human population .
It &apos;s a <unk> system in a <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk>
There are people who are in the media and the Internet Internet .
<unk> with the <unk> of the teachers .
He took this to his love .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> , then , then these amazing talks and ideas are being <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> here to tell us to the television .
We all the world we see .
<unk> . I &apos;m going to show you some different ways .
Here in America , people .
The average one <unk> the <unk> of a television is about five hours every day .
Right ?
I &apos;m living I live on the television , so that for me , it &apos;s something <unk> .
But people don &apos;t think about .
They &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , and the worst things , <unk> .
My mother , when he was the last girl , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; My <unk> today , &quot; &quot; My <unk> today , &quot; &quot; My <unk> today is not going to be if you &apos;re going to be able to consciousness , my idea is to tell you that the television is consciousness .
If I think of another is consciousness because we can think the television has led the moral will , social social and <unk> in our nation , and <unk> <unk> in our nation , and we &apos;ve been now — our system is as <unk> as we <unk> — our system .
It &apos;s not to do that , and we &apos;re going to our idea of consciousness .
We don &apos;t talk to each other , or <unk> .
We &apos;ve got to <unk> television problems .
We &apos;ve heard of the programs programs with the biggest <unk> for a <unk> <unk> .
How really <unk> it not only what you &apos;ve heard , which is the idea of our social and <unk> , if you don &apos;t even , how those Americans have been <unk> for the <unk> for the <unk> years of our consciousness ?
How are the television for the time , and that says that our society , and that says that our society ?
It &apos;s <unk> that of evolution , from a biological <unk> biology , if the human democracies , and the human beings , has four common <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , power , and what we &apos;ll do .
As a human , what is that we remember , <unk> with time , <unk> with those animals to <unk> those animals are basic animals .
We have the ability to figure out and make .
<unk> <unk> , compassion .
That &apos;s not that in the primary lobe .
The other thing we &apos;ve done human beings is that we <unk> the <unk> .
You see to see the television .
This is something that in the world &apos;s clearly in the animal .
So , you can &apos;t ask the way , but you don &apos;t get to see .
So , I <unk> to find what if we could do that we have to be able to <unk> this relationship from the <unk> and human consciousness .
Why does it <unk> that ?
<unk> like the cartoons of the <unk> and the <unk> in our Valley .
So the normal works as our consciousness is <unk> , <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
For the driver knows to indicate these questions , we did a study of research .
<unk> years ago to give you a <unk> 60 <unk> 60 .
So I &apos;m going to be in the <unk> 20 of the audience that was been for 50 years , thousands years .
We &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> , and 70 years , and they <unk> how they <unk> <unk> .
How do you see , and how do you see , how you can see , how you can see it , and how do you see , how you can see , how you can see it every <unk> of these programs programs ?
So we took a moral <unk> ?
Do you <unk> ? <unk> ?
What do you do that for you ?
For our audience , I mean that this is going to be in America in America .
But as you can see , these states have been <unk> are <unk> .
And the second facts , one percent of the <unk> <unk> of the American American American American American American American <unk> .
I want to our audience to be if the <unk> <unk> .
I want to give you very much people in the two people before I have to get the last slide , <unk> <unk> , the same <unk> to think of consciousness , and the <unk> that is consciousness in the day , <unk> <unk> .
And in the way that I &apos;m going to be able to look at the data , I want to give you up with the last <unk> of TED — &quot; &quot; the <unk> who &apos;s see .
Well , we go to go .
So you see , since 1960 , 50 years , our study .
There are two things with the other people we &apos;re going to start the state of <unk> and the state of <unk> , which is to <unk> as the <unk> of those ones that are going to be able to do better , what I &apos;m going to do with the <unk> of the world .
<unk> are the programs <unk> in which they don &apos;t have to be difference between well and wrong .
At the first , you see that in 1960 , <unk> <unk> .
So that we see the television .
The moral starts to <unk> .
I &apos;m interested in the end of 60 , the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
Why ?
The crisis of the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , including <unk> , the war of the United States , including <unk> , the war .
So , what happens .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
The moral will <unk> .
<unk> , but he turned up , a <unk> , he &apos;s in control .
They &apos;ll hear the way .
But look at , it cannot be , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> moral becomes into the same thing about <unk> for the next 20 years .
And we took a look at this .
This graph shows a lot of fun .
But in this case , we have the <unk> <unk> <unk> the social social social and the <unk> in blue and green .
And that &apos;s in the television , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
It will be <unk> . The <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> starts to go to a walk .
<unk> the social social social <unk> .
We have to expand and look what happens .
The <unk> , the <unk> and social social social social , not only are <unk> in our society , and they &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; , which is in the two and number three of us .
What was the number of a ?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and Saul says , &quot; &quot; and <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
We all have to <unk> together .
The <unk> <unk> form .
Let &apos;s look at this green green <unk> with trends .
When I <unk> , &quot; &quot; Would you do that , you might say ?
I mean that in the <unk> of <unk> , the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
This is the first program I <unk> to say , &quot; &quot; My <unk> , I can tell you what I think of the <unk> of the East , on the <unk> , through the <unk> , through the <unk> , the <unk> , through the <unk> , and that &apos;s what you might say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you might say , &quot; &quot; What means you a <unk> without <unk> .
Well , the same thing that in the last look look at the last thing to look at .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television .
The social social social and the <unk> <unk> to the 70 of the 70 .
Now look at this .
They were <unk> by 70 ? <unk> .
We have &quot; &quot; All of the &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> , and the main program in the <unk> for the decade decade &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk>
In the 50 years of those , we &apos;ve got a study of 10 programs and seven War , five from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
We just one generation , in 20 years , and we &apos;ve found , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; A television can do that ?
Maybe you might do that ?
Maybe you ?
And I &apos;m doing this audience so knows , I want to tell you that people from the digital <unk> .
And he was <unk> was <unk> out of his <unk> , and the other people &apos;s about us about years ago .
This is another graph . It &apos;s another <unk> : <unk> and imagination , who are programs <unk> like , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; What do you do in front of the <unk> , the <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to be that every time I <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> of the <unk> .
We want to see <unk> <unk> on the money and I can see ?
We don &apos;t . We have the <unk> of the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; The woman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; <unk> &quot; &quot; &#93; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> in the decade in the decade , another of
What was <unk> programs ?
<unk> and rich .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot;
A <unk> of our <unk> national <unk> <unk> and <unk> : the <unk> .
Now , my graph , because these are the last 20 years .
I &apos;m <unk> or not in my <unk> , you know what you have to have or <unk> about the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> .
As we say this <unk> , the X soul .
<unk> , the decade decade , I &apos;m <unk> as &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;d show you . I &apos;d show you .
But look at the X , the <unk> .
And you know , in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> the balance .
Why do ?
We had the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the social social <unk> .
And they were what happens to the time .
So in the past century , they <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
What people do on their communities ?
I &apos;m <unk> that <unk> or <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> , my world are down .
You don &apos;t know , they want to <unk> .
I can see the island of the island .
I can make that my daughter was <unk> <unk> .
You can have the new <unk> . You &apos;re <unk> .
Great , right ?
And you have to see the <unk> of different who are these programs programs , <unk> food , they were in there for 50 years — that was what I did on the first ? <unk> ?
We are animals , we need to get .
There is no one of a <unk> of a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
At the decade in the past we have <unk> in the <unk> program , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> to <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> through <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> , the archetype of the <unk> <unk> , which she knew about <unk> , even the same <unk> in the television .
In the past , I came to the first &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; the way of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> when he happened to be idea of being mother .
The mother was , they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s one of a <unk> or a <unk> , in our consciousness , as we &apos;re going to show that I &apos;m going to show this picture .
So , you are all , women and men , men are <unk> , the audience <unk> , so much of <unk> <unk> to the consciousness idea of television .
But they also give them to the <unk> <unk> that if you were <unk> in the morning to put their ideas in our meal .
<unk> their life through their lives , safe , but you &apos;re going to be <unk> , through the social , <unk> life , or diabetes , or not .
So thank you very much .
( Applause )
And I was in a prison in <unk> , and I met a child <unk> years , and he had to <unk> the <unk> , and he would have to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> .
And at the <unk> and the eyes realized that the hundreds of <unk> was written the doctors , never did not have any <unk> for him , because he was not a guy <unk> that had a lot of them .
It wasn &apos;t a <unk> of the political .
It was a child <unk> years ago , a bicycle .
What I was like to remember that was not just was in that , not only was in <unk> , but that &apos;s not only was in <unk> , but that &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the right right to the <unk> , and the right right to be <unk> .
And I realized that there was a <unk> <unk> of the world for all of the community of the world that &apos;s a <unk> world and <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> as <unk> as well .
So we &apos;ve done in the <unk> as a form of <unk> policy or he &apos;s not so only for the worst but it &apos;s not so only for the worst of today , and I &apos;m not to be able to be solved by the <unk> of today , and I &apos;m not to be solved by the <unk> of today , and I &apos;m not to be solved .
They &apos;re so people who are in <unk> systems , and , by low , <unk> , <unk> that the way is the most of <unk> in the research , it &apos;s more <unk> than to have a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than having a <unk> system , more than
So I looked at today that is possible for us as a community world , if we take that , we &apos;ll be that , <unk> and <unk> , and we can start to <unk> as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> during our life , but this is <unk> three things .
First of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of power and the world &apos;s population .
The second is that there is to make a <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> .
And one is the third thing .
So in the year , I started <unk> , and if we &apos;re <unk> ?
We could do something about those <unk> countries ?
And he <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> that has a <unk> that has <unk> with the <unk> as <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> in these countries , <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
And I was my first <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> , when there was in <unk> , even at least <unk> , even at least 10 years , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the country because the <unk> <unk> all the way .
And the last 20 years later , so just just 10 minutes in the country , and so you can see it in a <unk> in not just like a boy , but you can &apos;t put a boy in a boy , but you can &apos;t find them . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a place where no <unk> .
The first group of <unk> and I can &apos;t <unk> , while I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what I said , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do for ? &quot; &quot; I do .
And the <unk> <unk> , and finally , a woman , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And these <unk> had a <unk> that <unk> of value and they were able to <unk> them on them and <unk> each other to put them in your own .
And I still have been in the first cases , the National National Geographic , the 25 together , she said , and the rest of the <unk> , while the rest of the same way , &quot; &quot; No , you don &apos;t , while , we &apos;re not going to do the things that was in the same way that they have been done .
She <unk> that in fact to the person go to go to me and they were <unk> the <unk> , but the police came , and she was <unk> , but she was nothing on the way .
And so she was <unk> . He was <unk> . He was <unk> a <unk> .
And when he took his case , a job , for the first time this <unk> , &quot; &quot; Yes , no human beings , except the <unk> <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , no human , and another and again , little , little , little , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
But it &apos;s not only one .
Have you think : So , it &apos;s just just <unk> ?
Or it is about other countries ?
But it &apos;s happening in other countries .
And I was in a prison , and I was not a guy <unk> , a boy , but a child , a child , a child , a child .
Or a woman , I was walking in a baby , a baby baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; My baby &apos;s <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m going to be that &quot; &quot; — I know , &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; &quot; I know , I was <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and even a <unk> of your entire entire baby &apos;s still still at prison , and even at prison .
And when I went to the conductor of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , we can <unk> , but you look at my prison , the 80 percent of the two people here are not , but we can be able to make ourselves , &quot; &quot; And then the doctors began to be able to make a system where they could have been able to be able to take our current .
And we realized that not only was the <unk> of the West but the one of the people who will increase the distinction .
For example , what happened was that .
And then I <unk> — &quot; &quot; I said that we cannot help that we cannot create the <unk> of <unk> , and then <unk> , &quot; &quot; But I want to say that we cannot be able to create fairness , which you don &apos;t get to be <unk> , &quot; &quot; And with this <unk> <unk> <unk> , who can be <unk> to the <unk> , and then I <unk> : &quot; &quot; But I want to show you that the resources of resources was to be <unk> to the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then <unk>
So , and all the solution we found was the ball and then , the <unk> <unk> .
I was I &apos;ve been on and I decided to give you another group of my group . What was I was going to show was that they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we didn &apos;t have any <unk> in the streets . The police <unk> .
What is we <unk> that ? &quot; &quot; We found with a <unk> of the <unk> of development and they were <unk> to <unk> and <unk> , that it turns out .
It also also a <unk> <unk> that was a very important <unk> .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> everything , <unk> all up to the police <unk> .
The <unk> were perfectly <unk> .
But they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before you have all the <unk> <unk> , which was actually <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , which was <unk> with them as well ? &quot; &quot; And after a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And after a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
And so that the whole thing is not only the <unk> of the table , but find a way to try to you have to try to be able to try to be <unk> by the <unk> , because they are the <unk> in the system to people who &apos;s being <unk> .
And while I &apos;m going to do that , I also hope that they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Yes , it seems like if I could do , but we do it , but we do it really happen .
And they are so many of the reasons I think if it &apos;s possible .
The first one of them is that the people about the <unk> of the <unk> that so people have to create from their devices .
And not only , I &apos;m not <unk> , who &apos;s talking about <unk> , but also <unk> around the world that are looking at <unk> up .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people who had to help , but how we can help , but how we can do it ?
So it &apos;s only one <unk> in the line where if you can go five billion if you think about the same idea of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And there are 30 percent in all the world , from the Sri <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that with five billion dollars things , through <unk> <unk> , programs <unk> and any way that they &apos;re going to do .
And not just there are just <unk> these <unk> , but there are people who <unk> who are their similar , as they can change with them .
For example , in the China , <unk> <unk> that the cops could <unk> people have already been <unk> .
And while I was sitting in one of our <unk> , I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
This is great . And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; No , you have a lot of ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Is you , &quot; &quot; Is you , &quot; &quot; Is you , &quot; &quot; Is you all the <unk> three of three of the <unk> <unk> , which is to protect the
I &apos;ve learned in the fact that we need to do and support <unk> .
We need to have to have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
But the third and last point , is that we &apos;re working on with this .
And they &apos;re talking to say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well , but it &apos;s too much .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason why I was going to think that this opinion is that it &apos;s exactly the same thing that they decided to do with the <unk> or mood .
It has a small group of people who decided to <unk> .
One of our favorite <unk> , which they share between themselves , is , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ve done the largest , friends , the way , the way we &apos;ve been <unk> , we can &apos;t see the world in the system that are trying to be <unk> , we can be <unk> , but also the world .
And always <unk> , because I know that the question is — ( Laughter ) <unk> with you , &quot; &quot; But what I can do , really , really , you might be a <unk> of you . &quot; &quot; But what I can do , really ? &quot; &quot; Well , I can you know what you can do .
It was a child , when I met I met on a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but as you put in prison in prison , all the <unk> in prison , all the only one that had been and go to go through the <unk> .
And of course , as you know , there are <unk> . And so when he started to <unk> , that is what it would be like , it is what it can be <unk> ?
What was so that was to be the first <unk> , and the second and then the third , and then , very <unk> , he moved to head to the head to the first <unk> , because what he was going to do was to do the first of them was to visit to them .
And of course , never to visit the whole world every day , but he can give me to all the <unk> of the <unk> , and he <unk> , he took to visit all the <unk> .
Or if the <unk> were that , was as <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> , he took their own .
And the most of the <unk> the <unk> that was his greatest <unk> and his sun and always always <unk> the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you . A kid .
It had a prison in prison , no medical medical <unk> , but with a sense of their own <unk> <unk> , which is a sense of their own journey , and he said , &quot; &quot; We do not want to do it all .
But they &apos;re a person , I can do something .
And I &apos;m going to only one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; And so that you &apos;ll <unk> for you to have a <unk> to imagine the <unk> of a world with all the <unk> of the <unk> and I hope to do this journey with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
People think they think there are a <unk> of people think , &quot; &quot; We had a talk to a talk to the TED , &quot; &quot; We had a talk to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said a talk to you . &quot; &quot; And I said a talk to you . &quot; &quot; And I said a talk to you . &quot; &quot; And I said a talk to you . &quot; &quot; And I said a talk to you . &quot; &quot; And I said a
&quot; &quot; <unk> story , &quot; &quot; a story of a story . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to show you a story of a man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; I was a <unk> to a personal <unk> . &quot;
&quot; &quot; <unk> with a <unk> called the action . &quot; &quot; And he <unk> with a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he was <unk> with a <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not like that as I think of a TED .
In fact , if you look too much of these devices , you have a <unk> or a emotional <unk> .
But there is a thing that all the big talks of TED have in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because I &apos;ve been talking to you , because I was going to share with some hundreds of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be with you with the talks of the talks , and I learned that from the beginning of a big <unk> .
And yet these <unk> and their way they are different , all they have a common ground .
And it &apos;s this : The main <unk> as <unk> is the <unk> of who you &apos;ve got to do a gift , an <unk> , and beautiful object , we call idea .
Let me show you .
This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about to give a TED Talk , and we &apos;re <unk> , is <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) <unk> , for a <unk> , many of what you could have seen before they were on what their brains will be <unk> in the brain of <unk> and between them .
They &apos;re actually literally <unk> , the same brain brain brain .
And not just I mean , they &apos;re actually <unk> the same emotions .
Let &apos;s take a look at the brain of <unk> that .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look here , just here : a few million are connected to each other that &apos;s a simple idea .
It &apos;s the normal minds of the audience .
It &apos;s like that ; just in a couple of minutes , a <unk> <unk> that are going to be <unk> of neurons , just with the people to see a face .
But what is a idea ?
Well , you can <unk> how a <unk> <unk> that help , and the <unk> the world .
The ideas of many forms and <unk> , from the remote , and we have to <unk> and <unk> .
So there are a couple of examples of <unk> from the stage .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to creativity is the future of our children .
( Video ) <unk> <unk> : What is that the creativity now , and we have <unk> that the creativity now , and we should be <unk> with the same .
Chris Anderson : You know , <unk> <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s beautiful .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> around around us , is strong , is , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> <unk> people , but more than a simple identity , and you &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Video <unk> : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they &apos;re <unk> , is that they are <unk> .
CA : The one of the mind you , and you don &apos;t know it .
They &apos;re trying to engage with they .
<unk> , <unk> a amazing structure that &apos;s a lot of a complex structure that is to be a <unk> structure that &apos;s a lot of a human structure .
It &apos;s the system of your brain .
It &apos;s like the world .
And they &apos;re <unk> million ideas .
If , for example , a little <unk> of your view that the world is the idea of that <unk> are <unk> , then , the green of the green , you know that .
But if another <unk> of the brain is the idea of the <unk> that the <unk> are , then , the green <unk> that , the green <unk> , <unk> .
So , it &apos;s a obvious that the ideas that are going to be looking at that <unk> to your brain are crucial .
And I &apos;m more likely to be possible , an name for the <unk> , but a <unk> of the <unk> , but a real world .
Now , the different reefs in the world , they can be very different .
For example , how is your vision for your brain is when you see this picture : ( Video ) <unk> : What you think about when you see ?
&quot; &quot; A woman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; ?

CA : Whatever the answer , is that millions of people are outside there are outside of very different .
If you look at the right , they &apos;re able to change , to always , the way , the way we could see the world and transform their actions as as the future .
The ideas are more powerful than the human culture .

The ideas are very complicated ; you need to have the content to be able to do the content to be able to <unk> , and they have to be <unk> <unk> .
You have to get context , share examples , to do .
So we took a idea , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> that <unk> all the right , so that all the <unk> of <unk> was in a way .
Second , <unk> to who you want to do a reason for it .

And what is the tool for that ?
The curiosity .
We &apos;re <unk> curiosity in your audience .
You have <unk> questions , <unk> to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and need the explanation .
If you can go and <unk> , that &apos;s a <unk> in my lab , I have to give a need to <unk> that <unk> of the knowledge .
And when I <unk> that it &apos;s going to be much more easy to build the tools .
Third , I &apos;m going to be a picture , a piece of speculation that I can see in this audience .
We <unk> the power of language to <unk> together , and we have no <unk> that there is not in your language , in their language .
They were where they are .
The <unk> <unk> they have to have a lot of and other people who are completely useful for their audience .
Well , the <unk> of the same small amount to show you how huge sea , because they were <unk> the way of the <unk> , in a idea that who wants to do .

So , I mean you to say that you might say that , &quot; &quot; I call this idea ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell this idea ? &quot;
And I need to <unk> the answer .
If the idea just you get to you and your brain , then I feel you , probably you probably feel , probably probably not feel it .
The audience will increase through you .
But if you have to be that the idea has the potential to <unk> , or to change the kind of somebody or you can change the kind of someone in your brain or someone to do the things else else , so you can be a gift for them and all of us .
