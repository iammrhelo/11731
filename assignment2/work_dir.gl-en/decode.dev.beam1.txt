( <unk> ) <unk> on <unk> , <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> in a family of a half a half of a child .
My mother was five years when I was his father , but when I <unk> , he was a man of <unk> .
If their kids were children or girls , they will be to get to school .
So I guess I &apos;m going to show you .
My mother was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we &apos;re working on five percent <unk> , we &apos;re getting five .
And I can imagine that that I had to do when was the same time .
<unk> , I knew , I was going to be <unk> by the <unk> , or kids , kids just <unk> a <unk> .
At that moment , when I was a high school , I wanted to be <unk> .
I want to be <unk> to help , help women and kids .
So I &apos;m going to tell my education , but I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in my country , there was no <unk> to women on the <unk> so that , I still <unk> in the school of medicine , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father is <unk> .
And I went to America for America .
I <unk> my studies .
Whereas my education , I learned my country , I was <unk> my country .
You know , when I was my <unk> , I was my <unk> , I was my <unk> , and my country .
I &apos;m <unk> months , and I didn &apos;t know it .
My family <unk> in a field of <unk> .
So in the case I had the <unk> <unk> in my family .
I want to have to be the right .
But where I was my heart ?
My brain was in Afghanistan .
We all the days , when I <unk> the news , when I was <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> in my country , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go back back to my country , but , at the same time , I knew that I couldn &apos;t go because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
They live to live with them .
So , and it was all so happy .
I was <unk> to my head .
So we took the field in <unk> .
And when I go to the field of <unk> , there was seven million and a half of <unk> , <unk> million and half a half of <unk> .
<unk> , at the 90 percent were women and children , most of the men or they were in the war or they know ?
And so we have to do that <unk> <unk> , <unk> with things that don &apos;t get to be <unk> .
I was a <unk> with a <unk> , a children , there &apos;s a number of five and eight kids , there was a <unk> , without knowing what do .
And I had a woman that I didn &apos;t have to be , without any <unk> , no <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> , and they &apos;re not a place in what .
I had a student who have lost their parents , their <unk> and they have to have 10 years old , they had to take their families , to be the head of family and try to protect their own own , their kids , and kids .
The one was absolutely <unk> .
My <unk> is <unk> by my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So that moment , I was a different .
So that moment , I mean , I can do why do these people ?
How can I do ?
I &apos;m a person , I can do by them ?
But at that moment , I knew that my life began to my life .
<unk> . We got a position .
<unk> trust . I &apos;m going to trust a career .
I &apos;m going to show you to me my family , my family , my family , to my family , to the other country , to the other .
And at that moment I knew what was my <unk> , I was education and health and that was what we &apos;ve been done .
But they think that was easy ?
Well , I didn &apos;t know , in , the women didn &apos;t have access to the education .
In addition , after the <unk> in February , people have no <unk> in no one .
It was very hard to say , &quot; &quot; I want to do that &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; Who are me ?
Has that comes from the United States .
Has anyone who was going to be here .
I was <unk> on me ? &quot; &quot; Of course I don &apos;t .
And so what was really was to do was to trust with trust this community .
How do I do that ?
I went to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m going to ask you .
In the end , I have to a man .
He had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
And I went to her head in the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you a professor , &quot; &quot; I want to say a professor . &quot;
And he <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I think I can be a professor ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> you , like you think I can be a professor ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> you , &quot; &quot; <unk> my <unk> , &quot; &quot; Oh , my <unk> <unk> , I was <unk> to the voice .
So , at a year , we have a <unk> schools , 15 kids , 15 kids going to school , and he was amazing .
