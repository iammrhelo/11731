It was late in 2005 .
<unk> of science <unk> in <unk> , the Union <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my job , but precisely that day we had a little bit <unk> .
So let me go to my fellow of my fellow <unk> <unk> .
Chris took over 30 years to work in the <unk> , so they knew how much of the institutions were .
I told Chris I felt a little bit <unk> .
I was there a series of questions about the summit of science and electronic freedoms : very interesting .
But I wanted to tell you that the <unk> problems of face , a way that could reveal a difference .
( Laughter ) Chris was straight to the big and ask , &quot; &quot; All of these questions , who are the five ones who are more <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the political discrimination , the technologies <unk> , the <unk> and ...
<unk> , there &apos;s also a great thing , the job of <unk> as a detector and ...
Of course , the topic of genetic <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> genetic ?
&quot; Yes , that &apos;s the <unk> of human genes . &quot;
No !
&quot; &quot; Did you say that the American government would have been cured in the world ?
It can &apos;t be . &quot; &quot; <unk> to my <unk> and <unk> me Chris , three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he came to <unk> <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! You had right ! &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s that Chris is a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know about almost anything about it that &apos;s absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> , much less <unk> .
There was a lot of clear that there was too much to learn before I was getting one .
First of all , we had to know exactly what we &apos;re emoting to when somebody <unk> a gene .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the tallest thing of all are called &quot; &quot; DNA <unk> , &quot; &quot; or it is , a piece of DNA that &apos;s called a cell .
The teachers are saying , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t give you the genes of your body , put the genes on it . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , but the problem is <unk> in which we need to <unk> the genes for <unk> .
And the patents is not going to take a particular gene in particular , but all of the potential versions of that gene .
What does this mean ?
Because you can &apos;t spend your genes at a doctor and <unk> that <unk> , to see if they ate mutations , no harm of the patent troll .
It also means that the patent troll has the right to stop that gene to stop in research or clinical trials .
We found that these <unk> , the kid , private companies , <unk> parts of the human genome was <unk> to patients .
We have the case of <unk> , a little bit of 10 years , with a heart disease , a heart disease , if it &apos;s not about it , it can elicit the sudden death .
The company that <unk> the two genetic genes associated with this disease is a test for syndrome .
But then it came in <unk> and never came to <unk> .
But the company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , but the company <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
And two years of not going to be .
During that time , it <unk> died of <unk> long .
<unk> <unk> were a problem that makes patients .
Do we solve any way in front ?
Yeah , it turns out that the Supreme Court left left in a long list of previous cases , which is a series of things that are not <unk> .
You can &apos;t <unk> products of nature : the air , the water , the minerals , the elements of the grocery table .
Not not the laws of nature : the law of gravity , <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s very fundamental things , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all .
In our opinion , DNA , the structure of the most fundamental lives , which encode the production of all our proteins , is so much a product of nature as an law of nature , regardless of the nature of nature , regardless of that if we were <unk> in our bodies or at the bottom of a <unk> .
To get better , <unk> throughout the country to talk to the country to talk to experts : scientists , doctors , lawyers , lawyers <unk> .
Most importantly , we had a reason since a point of political view , and when fewer in theory of a legal view .
All of them thought the chance of working with our current topic were so many like scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the freeway of patents leads to these over 20 years .
It was literally thousands of <unk> genes .
The <unk> court was very <unk> in the status quo and the biotech industry around this practice , and the whole thing to <unk> the <unk> <unk> year after the Congress of the Congress , without going to run out .
In short , the courts weren &apos;t going to be willing to <unk> these patents .
But I didn &apos;t know , and I didn &apos;t really understand the challenges , and let us tell us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m no longer enough , &quot; &quot; but they were more <unk> to follow .
So we started looking at our cause .
<unk> by <unk> patents to be : <unk> <unk> by some technical topic , dark and messy .
So we don &apos;t have the kind of causes that kind of causes , we think that our cause has been much more .
<unk> of science freedom , the human progress and the rights of the patients .
So we decided to open up a causes that would not be like the ones who are in charge of patents , but a cause of the rights of the <unk> .
We could identify a <unk> of genetic <unk> that he was advocating by taking their patents to then organize a <unk> <unk> <unk> and experts who were going to run the courts like these patents to patients and innovation .
We think the ideal candidate to <unk> was <unk> <unk> , a company with the headquarters in Salt Lake City , <unk> .
We have <unk> the barrels of two genes , the <unk> genes and the <unk> .
Women with the certain mutations in these genes have more likely to get cancer and <unk> cancer .
It &apos;s a total <unk> over the evidence of <unk> in the United States .
They didn &apos;t have a lot of <unk> laboratories from <unk> tests .
There &apos;s a lot of money for his test : plus 3,000 dollars .
They tried to share their data data with the international scientific community .
And if you look at the worse , during a period of a couple of years , I <unk> them to facilitate his exam to that <unk> mutations that were identified by a team of researchers in France .
So I would argue that during that period for a couple of years , until a 12 percent of the women who are going to have made a wrong answer : a negative result that should be positive .
This is <unk> <unk> .
The sister of <unk> , Eileen , developed cancer , <unk> cancer .
So Babbage got negative .
The family <unk> .
The most likely was that cancer wasn &apos;t there in the family , so the other members of the family couldn &apos;t have to do the test .
But two years later , <unk> <unk> a <unk> cancer in American state .
And it turned out that the afternoon <unk> <unk> between that 12 percent of people who received a bad bad result .
If it used to <unk> the outcome right , it would make a test , and prevent their cancer <unk> .
They could <unk> these problems .
We <unk> genetic <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> organizations , four scientific organizations that are creating more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals , and the individual women who can &apos;t afford to pay the <unk> test , or they want a second view that they couldn &apos;t afford to give it , because of patents .
One of the main challenges that we &apos;re faced when we prepare this case was to think about science .
To argue that what I &apos;ve done was not a <unk> , and that the genes we have <unk> were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like , what is a gene ? What is the DNA ? What is the DNA ?
How about the DNA , and why is it not a <unk> ?
We spend hours of hours and hours with our <unk> and experts , trying to give us the way to explain these concepts of <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of the end of the metaphors , as the gold of the gold .
So <unk> DNA is like to extract gold from a <unk> or a river .
You can look at the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of work if you &apos;re going to pull the gold gold out of the mountain ; you can &apos;t <unk> it , it goes .
And the gold one , once from it , you can use it in all sorts of things that you couldn &apos;t use when she was on the mountain ; he &apos;s going to make it <unk> , for example . But you can &apos;t <unk> the gold , because it turns gold .
In 2009 , we were ready to present the case .
<unk> in the Federal Government in New York City , and the case <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
In March of 2010 , the judge issued you off his <unk> : <unk> pages . A full <unk> .
When you saw your opinion , you would get to <unk> with the science in the case .
I mean , our report — it was quite good , but not so good .
How could we develop a sense of this deep knowledge of the subject in that little time ?
We can &apos;t imagine how it would be possible .
So it turned out that the <unk> with which he was working with the judge of that , not only lawyer — it was scientific .
And it wasn &apos;t just science — I had a PhD in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Wow .
So he <unk> appealed to the <unk> <unk> of the Federal Reserve .
And here &apos;s the things that I &apos;m describing .
First , in a life moment of this case , the U.S. government changed out .
In the district court , the government issued you a report to <unk> .
But in direct <unk> to his own home head of patents , the government would get a report when you would say that this topic was the light of the decision &apos;s decision to the field of the district &apos;s decision , and that &apos;s the <unk> DNA wasn &apos;t allowed to be <unk> .
This was very important , totally unexpected .
The <unk> <unk> of the Federal Reserve leads all cases of patents , and it &apos;s called its <unk> very , very good for barrels of patents .
So even with this event <unk> , I <unk> with losing .
And so that was .
More or less .
The decision was about two against one .
But the two <unk> that voted against us , they &apos;ve designed by fully different .
The first one , the judge <unk> his gut and new theory , absolutely wrong .
( Laughter )
I would never forget that , so I didn &apos;t have meaning .
The other judge , the <unk> Moore , he said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to be the <unk> DNA .
But I don &apos;t want to tell you about the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third one , the judge <unk> , gave me the reason .
You have to be able to present a question that you can &apos;t respond to the <unk> .
So general , these questions would take a way of a paragraph box , a kid with lots of <unk> , a lot of <unk> , and so much .
We did what &apos;s going to be the most short question that I &apos;ve never experienced .
Five words : Are I going to ask human genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah .
I think I would say , &quot; &quot; Is the heart <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want you to have the same reaction that I have the same reaction I had to talk about about seven years . &quot; &quot; And of course , what would I say I was going to tell me about seven years .
The Supreme Court <unk> will only take us away from one percent of the cases that we had , and they &apos;ll hear our own .
It &apos;s the day of <unk> <unk> , and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people outside , people who suffered from the two : 30 of the morning to try to get in the <unk> .
Two organizations against chest cancer , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Chris , and I <unk> together in the hallway , when he asked him to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he .
But all that panic <unk> was when I came in the room and I saw my whole bunch of <unk> <unk> : women who knew that their stories would <unk> us , who would have been able to take a lot of money from their careers in order to make this fight , representatives of a spectrum of a spectrum of a spectrum in the court .
In the room , they were also three leaders of the Human Genome leaders , including the <unk> of DNA , James Watson , who would give you a report to court , when you would tell you that genes was a &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represented in the room and the <unk> that each one of the <unk> in the room and the <unk> that each one of the <unk> to do reality was a lot of what we had in play .
<unk> was <unk> .
Chris claimed he was brilliant .
But for me , the hardest thing was to see the <unk> of Supreme Court Supreme Court trying to understand the <unk> DNA , through a series of <unk> <unk> and dialogues of <unk> , in a very similar way of how it made our legal team for the last seven years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the isolation of the DNA with a <unk> plant .
The judge <unk> <unk> with a baseball <unk> from a tree .
And at the point I was written was my favorite moment , the <unk> <unk> that the DNA <unk> that the DNA was the waiting .
A natural segment of DNA is a product of nature , and it &apos;s not <unk> it &apos;s just because it was <unk> .
And what it is more , it didn &apos;t have nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There and four hours after the decision , five labs after the decision , five labs have been used to <unk> the exam to the <unk> genes .
Some of them would get rid of them , even cheaper exams .
Some of you would take a more rigorous examination , but some <unk> <unk> .
But the decision &apos;s decision was beyond <unk> .
It would take a practice of 25 years ago that we would have developed human genes in the United States .
<unk> <unk> that the innovation of innovation and the biomedical research .
And they helped patients like <unk> , <unk> and Eileen had access to exams who needed .
And a few weeks later , a few weeks later that the court was translated into his decision , I got a little package in the email of the email .
( Laughter ) It was Bob <unk> , a teacher from Duke University and one of the first people that I was and Chris went to visit to visit him , a teacher at the University of England and one of the first people that I was and Chris <unk> , a teacher at the University of England and one of the first people that I was and Chris <unk> , a teacher at the University of England and one of the first people that I was , and Chris <unk> , a teacher at the University of England
( Laughter ) <unk> too much with this case .
And part of what he gave us the courage of understanding these risks was to know that we were doing it right .
The process was about eight years since the beginning to end , with a lot of <unk> and <unk> for the way .
Of course they helped , but they have been the communities that <unk> , and the <unk> we &apos;ve had , the ones that have given us to .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to show you a <unk> of my projects , I &apos;ve made a <unk> of my projects , made it into the <unk> artist <unk> .
We would call it <unk> &amp; <unk> &amp; <unk> and we worked in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , what I call &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &#93; . &quot; &quot; And I found myself in the peculiar habit of my great uncle who make things for me , almost like me , almost like me , almost as if I was an extension of his body , open the lights or hit a <unk> glass card or a tobacco microphone .
When I grew up , the thing was the worst , and you &apos;ll see how a form of control .
Now , of course , I can &apos;t say nothing never because he &apos;s a very <unk> figure in the family .
What else was <unk> and <unk> was her use of the phone .
El <unk> and <unk> what I had <unk> the number for him .
It &apos;s the answer and as you see for my great guy , <unk> , &quot; &quot; The phone guy . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they make two people to use .
It &apos;s exactly the way my great uncle uses a <unk> to a person .
The problem is that when you walk home and I went to college , I started to have less their designs .
So I &apos;ve done a <unk> machine writing with that he could give their commands to <unk> and <unk> from all the world through emails .
What I had to do was to take a paper , put the paper on the car , write your email into your car , write email or command .
So this device would automatically automatically automatically the person in a matter of storytelling .
So here you can see that there &apos;s a lot of electronic games that understood all the actions of <unk> and <unk> in digital .
So my great uncle is just about mechanical interface .
And since then , the object has to be great and having a touch of <unk> , as I like to my uncle .
So the next job is a device announcing to the sound that we call &quot; &quot; The <unk> . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with being surrounded by a <unk> of creatures , sensitive and sweets .
This works like this . We have these <unk> right here on the wall and behind , we have these little creatures that are <unk> .
Instead they get it in silence , <unk> .
And if there &apos;s happier , even <unk> <unk> .
And at the very least sound , we would look back .
So we have these <unk> in three walls walls in a room .
And we had 500 of these little <unk> <unk> <unk> behind .
And that &apos;s how it works .
This is a clip of video .
When there &apos;s silence , you walk behind the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when there &apos;s silence , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s silence , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s silence , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s silence , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s silence , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s silence ,
And it turns out how humans or the creatures are real .
And let me tell you to the sounds that you &apos;re going to be a little bit .
It doesn &apos;t look at the <unk> sounds .
You take a train train in a moment when you don &apos;t smoke .
( noise ) But yeah to the sounds in the first plan . It was a second .
( <unk> ) We work very hard to do the most realistic thing possible .
Each <unk> has its own behavior , the psyche , the changes , personalities , etc .
This is a very premature vehicle .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We asked them to people , but we &apos;ve seen that the people was quite quite <unk> and child with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The <unk> person . &quot; &quot; We were quite intrigued by the idea of the play of invisibility .
How would it be possible to experiment ?
We &apos;ve worked with a <unk> company in the future of surveillance and we asked them to take software with a camera that could look at people in the room , next to these people and take a person with the bottom , they &apos;re invisible .
And I &apos;m going to show you a very premature vehicle .
For the right , you can see my colleague <unk> , who &apos;s done in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the video <unk> where the camera makes you invisible .
<unk> comes in the room . Wow ! I &apos;ll help .
You can see how the camera goes down and <unk> .
It &apos;s a premature video , so I still don &apos;t <unk> the <unk> and all of that , but it turns out it soon again .
This first came up in a room where there was a camera watching space and we had a monitor in every wall .
And second people go on in the room , <unk> themselves in the monitor , except by a difference : a person was constantly invisible when you want to walk in the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The shadow of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost as a <unk> piece of paper , like a child , a lump of oil print or a sun .
So this object seemed to be very strong and robust and <unk> , almost really weak .
People would go up to the room and almost <unk> thinking that was some <unk> .
But in the corner of black , you would take care of your head of a dead form .
<unk> and <unk> always .
( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of a setback of a setback .
His head is so heavy , full thinking of heavy thoughts , which seems to fall in his <unk> and his body grows out of it almost like a plant .
What it does is to move around the head of his head as if he was handed away in a very <unk> motion and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like thank you for that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there , and the soil outside the ground , they &apos;re going to go to free through space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
I &apos;m going to give you an example , and when people comes in the room , is this object .
And so , very slowly , in minutes , it &apos;s powerfully , powerfully , it turns out it &apos;s the point of falling .
This is an important moment because we wanted to infuse the viewer into a lifetime of almost going and help or save the subject .
Even though you don &apos;t need because it &apos;s even one of it again .
This work was a technical challenge to us and work very hard , as in most of our jobs , for the most of our jobs , for the years to get an mechanical dynamics .
It was very important for us to establish the exact moment in which we <unk> , because if you &apos;re making it , you &apos;re going to <unk> the balance , then you would notice , and if you don &apos;t pay enough , you don &apos;t get that <unk> , or that effect of wanting to go the help .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick clip where we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow .
Now it &apos;s going to offer nervous , so it &apos;s going to take it .
But it doesn &apos;t need to do , because it can <unk> itself .
This is a job with which we &apos;ve been very intrigued by the Neanderthals of the skin <unk> with thousands of lots of <unk> <unk> of optical fiber fiber of optical fiber known as the night sky .
And it &apos;s right on the night .
So I &apos;m going to tell you about a drop of a drop of <unk> , which was <unk> from the household .
And the idea was , it was very cold , distant , distant and gentlemen , like the universe with a family form of <unk> , which is very comforting and intimate .
And the idea was that somewhere in the way of looking at the shape of a <unk> bear and almost <unk> as a hole in space like a blank night , a brilliant night .
This is the very last job , even in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> space . &quot; &quot; Imagine a <unk> like this in the middle of the room , and there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> in a cube twice twice as high and four times its volume .
This object is in constant and <unk> to create a dynamic with people moving away , as if they were able to afford a secret in their together or something like this .
We worked with a lot of technology , but actually we don &apos;t like , because we don &apos;t like , because we &apos;re much suffering in our work for years and years .
But we &apos;re using it because we &apos;re interested in the way we help us the emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures that we &apos;ve created .
When a creature comes to the mind , and almost as if the creation process was discovering the way that this creature wants to be found that this creature wants to take and how to move on .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I &apos;m going to start writing a little bit , but it &apos;s not technology , and all of the way requires of you is this : you know it &apos;s about posture for two minutes .
But before I <unk> , I want to take a right now that <unk> your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
And do you think about you , how many of you are in some way ?
<unk> , the warden , <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes we put their arms like this .
Sometimes I had been <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> attention what we &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this in minutes , and I hope that if we had <unk> <unk> a little can change the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re going to get rid of the body language and put it into your body language of other people .
You know , <unk> — this , wow — ( Laughter ) a little programmer , a <unk> , a <unk> , a little bit of eye , or even something like a baby .
Narrator : So here are now coming to the number 10 .
This police is lucky and give your hand to the president of the United States .
There comes the first Prime Minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy <unk> : I &apos;m not . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy <unk> .
And even the BBC and the New York Times .
So when you think about speech , you won &apos;t verbal language or body language — that we call language , we talk of language , for so much of communication .
When we talk about communication we think about interactions .
What motivates me to your body language ?
What do you feel ?
There are reason to believe that this is true of this approach .
Sociologists spend a lot of time we spend a lot of time , or other people , or other people , or other people , about them .
We do <unk> and <unk> language language .
These <unk> can predict <unk> matter in life as the ones who <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or who we ask an entrepreneur .
For instance , <unk> <unk> , a researcher at the University of <unk> , demonstrates that when someone sees 30 seconds of videos , it &apos;s a real interaction of the medical physician if that doctor will be <unk> or not .
So you don &apos;t have to see so much if the doctor was or not enough , but if you &apos;re on the shoes of that person and how it <unk> it .
Even more <unk> , Alex <unk> , of Princeton , <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> of political candidates in a second 70 percent of the outcome of career , and the Senate of the U.S. and even in the digital <unk> , the <unk> <unk> used to be used to be the <unk> .
If you do a bad use of them is bad idea , right ?
Much of language is not verbal is to talk about how to connect to others , and what are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other audience in which it impacts our language not verbal , that we are ourselves .
<unk> our language is not verbal , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
So that language doesn &apos;t mean ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist , and I study the <unk> and I teach in a cybersecurity school program , so that it was inevitable that I had imagined the dynamics of power .
<unk> about it about all the dung calculator and <unk> .
What are the fathers aren &apos;t allowed to and <unk> ?
Well , why are this .
In the animal kingdom , you have to see the expansion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see the expansion .
So with a large , <unk> , <unk> space , with a large , <unk> space , basically <unk> space .
It &apos;s about <unk> .
And it works like this in the animal kingdom , and it works like this .
It &apos;s not just just <unk> .
Humans do the same . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re going to be able to be permanent , and also when you feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because it tells us the ancient and universal , universal , that are these kinds of power .
This expression , who is known as a couple , was studied by Jessica <unk> .
So that tells us that so much the people that you see from that so much the people that you see since were born as the people who are blind , they &apos;re blind to make a physical competition .
So when you look at the goal line and win no matter if you never have never seen it .
They &apos;re like this .
<unk> arms in schizophonia , the cheese .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We do just the opposite .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> little .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> with who &apos;s our next .
And so the animals like humans do the same .
And this is what happens when we started with helplessness .
What we tend to do when it &apos;s about power is <unk> language is not verbal .
So if somebody shows you very powerful with us , we tend to get smaller .
We do the opposite .
So if I look at this behavior in class , what do you notice ?
<unk> students <unk> all the language will not verbal power .
There are people who are <unk> from the <unk> , drop in the class , <unk> in the middle of the way before you start to take space .
When they sit , they seem spreading .
<unk> your hand .
So there are other people who are <unk> <unk> .
It was <unk> in his face and his body , sit in the chair , sit down in the chair , and they &apos;re going to make it as a hand .
So here just two things .
One is not going to <unk> it .
You &apos;ll have to see with sex .
Women are more likely to do that men .
Women have always been fewer powerful with men , so that &apos;s not surprising .
But the other thing that I &apos;ve noticed is that it seems to be connected to the phase of the students and their level of <unk> .
And this is very important in the class of MBA because of the <unk> account for the media .
The business schools have been planning with the distinction of grades .
<unk> women and men equally <unk> and then see these differences in the notes , which would be <unk> in part of the <unk> .
So I started asking them : if there &apos;s people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , it &apos;s going to <unk> it .
How would it be possible to do that other <unk> and who are helping them to participate more ?
My collaborator <unk> <unk> , which is in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can &apos;t afford to do it .
I mean , you can do it just for a moment and experience a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know that language doesn &apos;t allow language to other people feel that other people feel and they think there are many tests .
But our question was : <unk> language doesn &apos;t argue what we feel and think about ourselves ?
There &apos;s evidence that this is .
For example , we said when we &apos;re happy , but also when we &apos;re happy to laugh about it .
It works in the two <unk> .
When it comes to power , it also works in the two <unk> .
When we feel powerful is more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we were powerful to be powerful is more likely to actually feel powerful .
Well , the second question was , well , we already know that the head <unk> your body , but it &apos;s pretty sure that the body would get into your mind ?
And when I say , in the case of powerful , I &apos;m talking about ?
So I talk about thoughts and feelings and feelings of things that make these thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about the hormones .
How is the mind of powerful compared to what are not ?
The powerful people tend to be , is not surprising , more <unk> and secure , more optimistic .
They have the feeling they &apos;re going to win even in sound games .
They also tend to think of a more abstract way .
And there &apos;s a lot of difference . They &apos;ll get more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of difference from the differences between the powerful and the ones that are not .
It &apos;s also a difference in two key hormones : testosterone , which is the hormone of <unk> , and the <unk> , which is the hormone of the stress .
The <unk> <unk> with a lot of power in the <unk> of <unk> have levels high levels of testosterone and levels of low levels of <unk> . And the powerful leaders are powerful and effective and effective leaders .
What does this mean ? When I talk about power , I &apos;m talking about the testosterone , because I had to see with <unk> .
But the power also has to see with our reaction to stress .
We want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with high levels of testosterone , but sensitive to stress ?
Don &apos;t , true ?
We want a person who &apos;s powerful , <unk> and dominant , but not very sensitive to stress , a person who is quiet .
We know that in the <unk> <unk> , if a <unk> has to take control , if somebody has to take control , take a sudden of that paper , you take a sudden of that paper , in the deadline of days , his testosterone was very much and <unk> them as well .
We have this evidence , that the body can get into the mind , at least the facial level , and also that the paper paper can hit the mind .
So what happens when you get a piece of paper ? What happens if you do a minimum level , like this little <unk> or <unk> ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; I want you to go there for two minutes you would say this , that will make you more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to bring people to the lab and to make a small experiment , these individuals , so two minutes , both of the <unk> , both of the <unk> , and they said , I &apos;m going to show you just five of these <unk> <unk> , although they &apos;re only two .
This is one .
A couple of days later , a couple of days later , a couple of days later , a couple of days later a couple of days .
The <unk> press <unk> <unk> .
So here we have a couple more .
You can be walking , or sitting .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
Now let &apos;s zoom in .
This is very low power .
When I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , really .
This is what happens .
They come in , put it in a jar , and you &apos;ll take it for two minutes : you have to do this or that . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to <unk> with a concept of power .
We want to feel the power .
They have this two minutes .
And then <unk> , &quot; &quot; how powerful you feel ? &quot; &quot; then we put the chance to bet , at the end we take another step of spit .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experiment .
This is what we found .
I &apos;m going to care at the risk , to bet ; we found that when they are in a position of high power position to bet the 86 percent .
When they are at the bottom of power , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
Let &apos;s look what we found with testosterone .
It was <unk> from his normal situation by getting , the powerful people showing an increase from 20 percent and <unk> level of 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , two minutes , and we &apos;ll let that change .
Now the results with <unk> .
The most powerful one is the most powerful , the most powerful percent increase over the 15 percent .
We only have two minutes to get these FOXO changes that will take your brain to make it safe , secure or <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> .
We all know that feeling , right ?
<unk> that our language is not verbal <unk> the way that we &apos;re not just too much , but we are ourselves .
The body can break the mind .
So the next question , of course , is — can a gesture of power in a couple of mental ways ?
This is the lab , this experiment , are just two minutes .
Where can you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what you care about .
We think where it needs to be in <unk> in the <unk> , as the <unk> social <unk> , which we believe , as the <unk> social <unk> , we believe where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we believe where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we believe where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we believe where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we believe where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we believe where we are .
If you hear your friends .
For the teenagers , the teenagers are in the room .
For some people &apos;s talking about the school .
It can be in the future of a business or giving a talk like this or going to an interview interview .
It offers one with the most people who identify because many of the people we identify as a lot of them , the interview interview .
So we tested the results , the press <unk> and said , well , this is what you do when you go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we were <unk> , and we said , no , no , not what we wanted to say .
So a lot of reasons , don &apos;t do that .
Again , it &apos;s not about <unk> to other people .
It &apos;s about to talk to you .
What you do before going to an interview interview ?
You &apos;re sitting there . I &apos;ll tell you your iPhone — or your Android , we &apos;re not going to leave someone outside .
<unk> your text messages , you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re pathologically small , when really what you should be doing is this , maybe in the <unk> , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s wrong .
That &apos;s what we want to figure out , is it ?
<unk> people in the lab , and they ate <unk> <unk> and low <unk> interview over a <unk> interview .
I had five minutes of <unk> . It &apos;s been filmed .
And also , they are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> to not give it verbal expression .
Imagine that one person show you .
Over five minutes , nothing is worse than you <unk> .
People are asking this .
It &apos;s what Marianne &apos;s calls &quot; &quot; being in rural Africa . &quot; &quot; This goes out the <unk> .
This is the interview of the interview that <unk> , because we wanted to see what we had .
We &apos;ve got analysts , four on total .
They didn &apos;t know the hypothesis . Don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have a sense of that position that counts every person and the end end of look all the scenes , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , &quot; &quot; all of you .
We don &apos;t want to hire <unk> .
It would make a much more positive measurement of a general .
It &apos;s not about the speech content .
It &apos;s about the presence of the presence of the speech .
Because the astrolabe , all of these <unk> <unk> would ask us to wonder ?
Does it mean ? What ratings do you have ?
These things don &apos;t affect . That &apos;s what it causes .
This class of things .
Every person would get itself , basically .
<unk> what are .
It makes their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what it causes or <unk> the effect .
When I talk to people about this , that our bodies change our mind and behavior can change our way to be , it seems like , &quot; &quot; It looks like . &quot;
I <unk> : You know until you do it .
I &apos;m not like this .
I don &apos;t want to get there .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you as an <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an <unk> and about feeling like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
When I was 19 , I was 19 .
( Music ) ( Laughter ) And I went to him and I found a lot of <unk> <unk> .
I was wearing a car card .
It was in the intensive care intensive company in his head , and I was told that my <unk> <unk> <unk> two standard . It was very traumatic .
I <unk> my son , because I would hear me as a <unk> , and I had a <unk> girl .
So I went to college and tried to go back .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to end the career .
You have to accept that there are other things you can do , but in your case of your case not . &quot; &quot; I had to deal with that , and I have to say that you &apos;re going to give you your identity , what really you are , that &apos;s the thing that I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to be smart , who will be smart , who will be happy , that &apos;s the thing that you can do .
<unk> totally helpless .
So I worked and I worked and worked , and I had <unk> and worked , and I was lucky , and I worked .
And I finally went to college .
I took four years later with my colleagues , and he asked me to convince somebody , my <unk> from Hurricane <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to me , and I felt like I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
The night before the first exhibition was , the first night of the first three days , the first night of the first three days , the first night of the first three days , the first night of the first of the first three days , and the night before the first of the first of the first days , the first night of the first of the first three days , the first night of the first of the first three days , and the night before the first of the first of the first days ,
It &apos;s like this .
I had so much afraid of excluded the next day that I would say , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave it . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave it . &quot; &quot; She told me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you go to it , because I think , because I think , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you leave .
You walk , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;ll do all of the exhibitions that will be <unk> .
It &apos;s called to do , and to do it and make it even though they &apos;re too careful or even paralyzed and having a sense of <unk> , until you get the moment you &apos;re going to <unk> us .
I got there . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years of college , a few years , a couple of years , you know , in <unk> , <unk> at Harvard , now I &apos;m at Harvard , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s not wrong but too much while I had the feeling I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
At the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t get on the class of all semester , to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you have to participate and go back and go back to my <unk> . I didn &apos;t even know before .
So I said , &quot; &quot; We should not be here . &quot;
That was my moment .
Because we have two things .
The first thing I realized : <unk> ! I don &apos;t feel like this .
I didn &apos;t feel like this , but she and I would go back to his place .
The second was , of course , to be here !
We &apos;re going to do it and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . Yes . Yes . &quot;
It &apos;s going to be <unk> , you &apos;re going to be powerful , and you know what ... ( Applause ) You &apos;ll go to the class and you &apos;re going to give you the best speech of everybody . &quot; &quot; And you know ? He did the best narrative of all , the people would say , &quot; Oh , I didn &apos;t think it would be out there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He came back to me a lot of months later , and he said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going
In order to <unk> .
So now I want to tell you there are no way to do that .
There &apos;s no way to be going on .
There &apos;s a lot of it that to do enough and <unk> .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
<unk> changes can take the big <unk> .
It &apos;s just two minutes .
Before I was asking the next story where I was going to <unk> , for two minutes , I would ask you , in the <unk> , in the middle of it , in the middle of it , the door closed .
This is what you have to do .
We put the brain to get the best of that situation .
It &apos;s called testosterone . <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t know that we want to care about that situation as I don &apos;t show you who are .
You know that that situation I &apos;m going to say who I &apos;m going to say who are , and I &apos;ve shown you to prove it .
I want to tell you before anything that we had a position of power , and I also want to share my experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) <unk> , <unk> people , because the best you can use is those without resources or technology , without a position .
You know , it &apos;s because they can do it in private .
We just need their body , privacy and two minutes to change the <unk> of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; &quot; — which is probably a good option .
( Laughter ) Anyway , I &apos;m going to talk about what are the big problems of the world ?
And I should say , before I keep going on , I &apos;m going to take you to each one of you who had <unk> and paper because I &apos;m going to ask me to see how we do it .
So it <unk> <unk> and paper .
After all , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world of the world .
I &apos;m going to give you just a few .
800 million people spend hunger .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to water <unk> .
Two billion no sanitation .
Two million people die of HIV and AIDS .
<unk> lists .
Two billion of people who were going seriously affected by the climate <unk> — and <unk> .
We have many other problems there .
In a ideal world , <unk> all , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question that I think we should do — and that &apos;s the reason why we are in the economy of the economy — it &apos;s saying , if we don &apos;t do it , we really have to start asking ourselves , that problems should solve first ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to <unk> .
If you would say , 50 billion of <unk> will spend the next four years to make the next four years to improve this world , what would we spend ?
<unk> 10 of the most big challenges in the world , and just <unk> it , we <unk> climate , <unk> , education , education , <unk> , education , <unk> and <unk> movements , voluntary movements and water and <unk> and barriers to trade .
We think these , in many ways , <unk> the greatest problems in the world .
How would we be <unk> would be <unk> , what do you think ?
Why should we begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad
In fact , that was the <unk> of what was talked about in <unk> .
But it turns out , there &apos;s a problem if you &apos;re going to be able to get people to care .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
We &apos;ve forgotten that the greatest problems we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the thing is not going to get the problems , but they &apos;re getting the solutions to the problems .
And he had — naturally — it &apos;s going to make a little more complicated .
To <unk> , it would be something like <unk> .
For diseases , they could be clinics or networks for mosquitos .
To <unk> , they would be the court of peace in the United Nations , and so we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to tell you was to do that in 30 seconds — and I know that in 30 seconds — and I know that it &apos;s something impossible to do — let &apos;s ask what you think are the <unk> priorities .
And also — in here , of course , where the economy becomes <unk> — <unk> what we should not be able to do first .
What should it be at the end of the list ?
Please , it &apos;s just 30 seconds , maybe it &apos;s <unk> with people , and just imagine how we should be the main priorities and the fewer <unk> of the solutions that we have for the greatest problems of the world .
The surprising of this process — of course , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m just 18 minutes I mean , I &apos;m just 18 minutes of an important amount of time .
I want to like <unk> , and you &apos;re thinking about this process , and that &apos;s what we actually did .
And also , I &apos;m also sure , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;re going to be sure we &apos;re also going to have these <unk> after you , to think , how do it really do ?
Ever since then , there &apos;s one really question , why never have done a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all the organizations would be on the tallest of a list like that .
But also all the <unk> <unk> didn &apos;t be on the tallest .
And since there &apos;s a lot more <unk> , you don &apos;t have any <unk> numbers like this .
So 60 years ago that there &apos;s the U.N. , and it &apos;s still no longer a basic list of the big things that we can do in the world , and said , what we should do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t think we &apos;re not <unk> — each decision is a <unk> , so it &apos;s not just <unk> — and that &apos;s not sure it &apos;s so good as if we actually did it , and it &apos;s not aware that it &apos;s so good as if we actually did <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that .
So what I &apos;m emoting to is really saying that we had , for a long period of time , a situation in which there are extraordinary options .
There are many , many things that we can do there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , and not the <unk> .
We had no idea .
Imagine that you would take a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the prices are .
You know you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a <unk> , they could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a familiar pizza . It could be a individual pizza , right ?
You know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s trying to do the <unk> <unk> — it &apos;s about to put the prices of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 30 of the best economists in the world , three of each area .
In order to take three of the best economists from the planet <unk> about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be your cost ? What do you do ?
The same thing with <unk> disease .
Three of the best specialists saying , what can we do ?
What is the price ?
What should we do about that , and what would it be ?
And so in front of it .
So we took some of the best economists in the world , eight of the best economists in the world , including three <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in May of 2004 .
And we call the &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> of the University of Cambridge decided to <unk> the Real <unk> of the economy .
<unk> works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did , it was actually a <unk> list .
And then you <unk> , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy to me that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The topic is , obviously , if you want to know malaria , ask questions about malaria .
If you want to know about the climate , ask questions about it .
But if you want to know what the two you might solve , you can &apos;t solve any of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
<unk> .
They &apos;re going to be that <unk> , which we have to do first , and we have to do first , and we have to do after .
So this is the list , and this is the list I had to share with you .
Of course , you can also see on the Web , and I &apos;m sure we also <unk> this as a <unk> .
Basically I said there was a list in which I said there was bad projects — basically , this is the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got less than a result as a result .
And then they were the right projects , good and <unk> .
And of course , it &apos;s very good projects that we should start to do .
I &apos;m going to start from the last way that we were going to end up with the best projects .
This was the bad .
As you can see at the end of the list is the climate <unk> .
This offends the lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things about the things that people will tell you should not be <unk> .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why ?
And the truth , I &apos;m also going to tell you about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we don &apos;t have to agree with the lists of <unk> .
The reason he worked with that is that it &apos;s <unk> — or to do something more that <unk> — it &apos;s not a good business for just because it &apos;s too inefficient .
It &apos;s not saying that there is no global warming .
It &apos;s not saying it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying what we can do for it is very little , at a very high cost .
What basically tells us , the media &apos;s media models and <unk> , if all the world went out according to a hundred billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Two or three times the global help by developing development that we <unk> in the Third World every year .
And to do very little good .
And all of the models show you that they &apos;re going to have a couple of years old face .
So a guy in Bangladesh that makes a <unk> in the <unk> can expect to <unk> .
What &apos;s something like , but not very well .
So the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something else .
And just by giving a baseline , the United Nations estimates that by the half of that amount , a hundred billion dollars a year , we could solve all the basic problems of the world .
We could give water water , sanitation , sanitation , <unk> and education all the human beings on the planet .
So we were going to <unk> , we want to spend twice a little bit wrong ?
Or , half doing something wrong ?
And that &apos;s where it turns into an evil project .
It &apos;s not saying that you &apos;re going to take all the money of the world , you don &apos;t want to do it .
<unk> , that when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just not our first priority .
The right projects — I &apos;m not going to comment on all — but there &apos;s a <unk> , scale of basic services — sound like a very little bit , just because it &apos;s a little bit , just because , it &apos;s a big thing .
It was very well , but it also and very , very , very <unk> .
Again , what &apos;s told us , and suddenly we started thinking about the two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , there &apos;s a lot of sanitation projects .
Again , sanitation and water is important , but it &apos;s also important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four <unk> priorities that should be , when fewer , the first one that we think when we talk about how we should solve the problems of the world .
The tallest fourth <unk> is malaria — treating malaria .
<unk> malaria is about a couple of millions of people put every year .
It could even be a <unk> point of GDP as a year for the year .
If you take a few 13 billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce <unk> to half .
We could prevent death from 500 people , but what is more important , we could prevent a billion people to show each year .
<unk> <unk> his ability to treat many of the other problems that have to deal with , of course , in the long run , also <unk> with global warming .
The third one is the free trade .
Basically , the model showed you that if you were able to get the free trade , and especially <unk> <unk> and Europe , we could basically rise the global economy down to the <unk> number of two , two on the year of <unk> trillion <unk> year .
Again , we could really take away the 200 or 200 billion people of poverty , radically rapidly and very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third one one thing we could do .
The second one is going to be <unk> in <unk> .
We don &apos;t think it &apos;s a general way of treating the <unk> , and it &apos;s saying , the lack of <unk> .
Basically , half of the world &apos;s population has required of iron , <unk> , <unk> and vitamin B12 and vitamin vitamin D , the half of the world &apos;s population .
If you take 12 billion dollars , we could make a profound <unk> on this problem .
This would be the second better <unk> that we could do .
And the best project would be <unk> in HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we &apos;ve invested 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could prevent 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Another time , what this makes and what is happening is that we have two different ways as to treat HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is <unk> .
Again , in a ideal world , we would do two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should be able to see where we should invest first .
And the treatment is much , much more expensive than <unk> .
So let me tell you , what &apos;s going on is you can do much more investing in the <unk> .
Basically for the amount of money that we could do is we can do it in treatment , and 10 times more in <unk> .
So again , we have continued to <unk> more than treatment , as the first option .
What this makes us really do to think about our priorities of our priorities .
I &apos;d like to tell you how to do your list of <unk> and say , <unk> ?
Would you ask something like what we did here ?
Well , <unk> , one of the things is back to climate change .
<unk> are a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , but we &apos;re very unlikely we did that .
We also could change climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t set all the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if we focus on the problems we focus on the other .
In those we can do much more well than little good .
And I think it &apos;s true — Thomas <unk> , one of the subjects of the <unk> <unk> , which explained it very , very well .
One of the things that people have <unk> , and in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of climate change , people will be much more rich .
Even the most poignant impacts of the United Nations were even more <unk> in the United Nations , even the <unk> of the most <unk> impacts of the U.N.
It tells us that an media person in the developing world will be so rich as we are today .
And much more likely , it &apos;s just three to four times richer than we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
But the question is , when we talk about saving people , the help people in Bangladesh , we &apos;re not talking about a poor <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about a very rich <unk> .
And so the real subject , of course , that &apos;s saying , we want to spend a lot of money to helping a little bit about it , about 100 years ago , a fairly wealthy one ?
Or , or we want to help the poor , or we want to help people the poor , or we want to help the poor people , and who we can help ?
Or as the president said , imagine you , imagine that rich — as it will happen — a wealthy <unk> , a rich <unk> in the <unk> thinking in 2005 thinking , &quot; &quot; How do we get so much for a little bit of this topic of climate <unk> , and if we were so little by helping my grandmother to get a little bit of the subject of climate <unk> , and if we were so little by helping my grandmother , and you would pay it much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think what
Even if you don &apos;t agree with a typical view of this problem .
Now , of course , that &apos;s fundamentally because climate change has a very good photos .
You know that we have &quot; &quot; El &quot; &quot; — it seems cool , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I want you to look at , right , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to catch it up to <unk> <unk> in his next movie <unk> <unk> in Tanzania or something like this . ( <unk> )
So in a lot of ways , I think the <unk> <unk> and the whole discussion about the Internet is an active defense of problems .
To make sure it &apos;s not just to make it well , it &apos;s going to feel good .
It &apos;s not going to do the things that have the greatest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to make things that have the largest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to make a bigger good .
The other objections , I think , who are important , is that I &apos;ve had — or we &apos;re — you &apos;re — you &apos;re — you &apos;re taking a false choice .
Of course we have to do it all , in a ideal world — it &apos;s totally entirely occurring .
I think we should do all the things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed world decided we went to spend twice as we &apos;ve done , right now , that in 1970 in the developing world .
As our help rise to half .
It doesn &apos;t seem that we are in the way of solving all the big problems .
Similarly , people would also say , but there are the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100,000 billion <unk> . So we don &apos;t spend that good in the world .
I &apos;m going to take you .
If some of you can talk to the Bush to do that , it &apos;s okay .
But of course , the subject is still saying , that if we take another 100 billion dollars , we still want to get rid of the best possible way , right ?
So the real problem , it &apos;s going to start again and think what &apos;s the right priorities .
It should mention briefly , is this really the right list ?
You know , when you ask the best economists in the world , you will take you off by <unk> men and old men from the United States and old states of the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily necessarily a great way to look at the whole world .
So let me cover the 80 <unk> of all the world to do the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying in college , and that <unk> English .
Most of them were , first in developing development .
They had the same material , but they could take away from the topic of the subject of discussion , how they actually did , to <unk> their own lists .
And the surprising was that the list was very similar — with <unk> and disease in the highest and <unk> climate change .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
We had many other <unk> and students college and different things .
They all had as a result .
And that &apos;s me for me a big hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a way that I think there &apos;s a way to start thinking about our priorities , and say , what is the most important thing in the world ?
Of course , in a ideal world , we would have to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do it all , we can begin to think about where we do ?
I see <unk> <unk> as a process .
So we did in 2004 , and we hope we would have a lot more people , to get better information information in 2008 , 2012 .
It would take the way right to the world . But we also start thinking about political <unk> .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t make things in the things that we can gain a little high cost , and it &apos;s not the things we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we make some great things where we can do a huge well , the low cost , right now , right now . After the day , you may be in odds with the discussion of how we can actually <unk> , but we have to be honest and <unk> to say , if there &apos;s a lot
If we care about some things about some things , they &apos;ll be able to worry about others .
So I hope that this is going to allow us to identify the best priorities of priorities , and think how we worked better for the world .
Thank you .
A couple of years ago , I stood out of the house with no keys .
He had had a house in my house , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to me , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to go visit a friend on the other side of the city , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , because that temperature <unk> the two scales .
And I was in the <unk> , searching for the pocket and <unk> that I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , they could see them through the window outside the desk table , where the <unk> .
But they were all <unk> .
I couldn &apos;t tell me night at my friend &apos;s home , because by the morning I had a trip to Europe and he needed to take his passport and <unk> .
So desperate and a cold , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the window .
It costs many money but not more than a <unk> in the middle of the night .
Well , let &apos;s take out to the neuroscience of neuroscience .
<unk> <unk> , which elevates the heart rate , the consumer levels of adrenalin , which elevates the heart rate , which elevates the heart rate of the adrenaline .
So the next morning when I came up after a little bit , worried about the window , I was going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to me , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to tell you that I was going to have in Europe , and by the <unk> that I was going to have in Europe , and the <unk> who was going to have in Europe , was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> who was going to have in Europe , was the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And to get the airport to the airport , I didn &apos;t tell me that I was going to read his passport .
So I came back quickly at home , with snow and ice , in 40 minutes , I came back to the airport and I came up at the airport and I got a long time , but I &apos;m going to <unk> my seat to another person who I came back to .
Or , in the case of that <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things , I mean , in the case of <unk> things
So Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me
It was something that &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; Gary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who <unk> about this was a few years ago , and he also called <unk> <unk> .
If you get a team of experts who try to determine what happened ?
( Laughter ) Because in the <unk> <unk> , as he explained , I &apos;m going to know what you can do , and you try to determine what you can do .
What I want to talk about today is what we can do today is what we can do today .
Some things are responsible , other are not so much .
I &apos;m going to start for MIT .
They took places around the house for the things that they lost easily .
Well , this sounds kind of common , and it &apos;s like this .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain structure , called the hippocampus that evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of important things .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain is part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain &apos;s brain is the part of the brain .
In fact , there &apos;s been somebody who did the experiment of <unk> sense of <unk> sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s been somebody who did the experiment of <unk> sense of <unk> sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t get too much too much and not with things that we would have .
So there &apos;s why you take some place for the keys .
To wonder , a specific disinfectant . &quot; &quot; <unk> , a specific table .
If you take a place , and if you look at the things you &apos;re going to be in your place when you get it .
And when you get <unk> ? <unk> a picture with your cell phone ?
It offers an email to the photo for the cloud .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) These are really important things .
Remember that when we &apos;re under stress , the brain emits <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> the mind .
We have to recognize that low stress will not be able to give the best of you yet , and that should establish a system .
I think when you give you a medical decision .
We all will be somewhere in a situation in a situation that &apos;s in a situation in a situation .
And I want to talk about .
or any decision that we need to do is something that we need to do to do or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do that to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do that to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision
Suppose you &apos;re going to the doctor , and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the test and have a little bit loud . &quot;
You know that the cholesterol cholesterol came up to the emergency cholesterol .
And I think it was thinking that I have the high cholesterol is not very good .
( Laughter ) So I asked him to ask some statistics to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic
It &apos;s the number necessary to play .
It &apos;s the number of people who have to take a drug that would have to make a drug , but even if you help a person .
And <unk> , what &apos;s about statistics is that ?
The number should be one . My physician won &apos;t tell me something that don &apos;t help me .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work .
We don &apos;t know the <unk> mechanisms .
<unk> estimates that the 90 percent of drugs work between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So the <unk> in the case of the <unk> <unk> , what do you think is ?
How many people have to ask before to help someone ?
This second is the results of results in the results of the results , and this second is just the results of results in the results of the results , and this second , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results , the results
I even <unk> the data .
And it was <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ,
In the case of this drug medicine ?
And include things out of it . <unk> <unk> in the muscles and <unk> , <unk> <unk> — But <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . I don &apos;t think I don &apos;t .
You have 15 times more powerful than the drug you would have <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m not saying if I had <unk> <unk> or not not not by the <unk> <unk> or not not by saying , &quot; I &apos;m not saying if we were <unk> <unk> or not not by the <unk> <unk> . I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying if we were <unk> <unk> or not not by the <unk> <unk> or not not by saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying if we were <unk> <unk> or not not by the <unk> <unk> or not not by saying , &quot; I
I just had to have this conversation with only one of your physician .
You have to have access to this information to be able to talk to you to talk about this information to you .
I mean , I &apos;m talking about this number of this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> that I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , which I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually <unk> it , that I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> , but
<unk> prostate cancer , <unk> prostate cancer , <unk> is 49 .
Yes ! ( Laughter ) Yes , you have to recognize it for every person that you help .
And the side effects in this case is <unk> in 50 percent of patients .
<unk> hurts , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , the idea of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the conversation comes from .
The ideal is not having to create all this right time .
There &apos;s also to think of subjects like the quality of life .
These are things that we have to think about now and <unk> with the family and the loved ones .
Remember : low stress of the brain emits <unk> and one of the things that happen at the moment is that you &apos;ve had a lot of systems .
Evolution used to help .
It &apos;s because if the body <unk> metabolism in these things , because if the body hit the metabolism in these things and they don &apos;t adapt quickly quickly quickly , because if your body hit the metabolism in these things and they didn &apos;t know quite quickly , because if your body hit the metabolism in these things and they didn &apos;t know quite quickly , because if your body hit the metabolism in these things and they didn &apos;t know quite quickly , because if your body hit the metabolism in these things and they didn &apos;t
<unk> , one of the things that belonged to you , is the same thing that you would expect to be a lot of time , as I &apos;ve shown Danny Kahneman and his colleagues .
So we need <unk> to think about it in this type of <unk> .
I think most important is recognize that we all have <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> you .
And the idea is to think of <unk> in what they can be these <unk> , the systems that can minimize the damage or just to prevent these <unk> things .
And I would tell you that night with snow &apos;s snow , and when I came back from the journey , I was working on the journey of the house inside and an easy code to remember .
It &apos;s not fully organized organized .
Good day !
Are they <unk> ?
Anybody ? No . Well , nothing .
&quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#93; &#91;
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
&quot; &quot; Come on , you see , <unk> this ! &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , you see it .
It seemed like <unk> by having to talk to me , and it seemed like I &apos;d like to talk to me .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s only one word for a word , but a <unk> boy , just a <unk> boy , just a <unk> boy , just a <unk> boy , just one word he did a <unk> man who had a young man who had a young man who had a young man who had a young man who was just a <unk> man who was just a <unk> boy , but a word for a word for a word , but a word for a word , he would say , a <unk> boy , just
How can we talk about this ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
And it was very much .
How do we get here ?
Right now , right now , right now , right now , right now , right now right now .
And despite all , it &apos;s true , despite all , despite all , despite all , despite all , and despite all of it .
Or it &apos;s not a language that we &apos;re talking about in the university or where we &apos;re talking about the work . It &apos;s not a language that we use in the university .

It was going to be his next .
Because if you take any <unk> product plant , you know that it &apos;s not a place .
No one would be a local product .
They were using consumers , consumers , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> consumers , <unk> <unk> , <unk> consumers , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,

language are not one , two or three words or letters in line .
Or if a son or his heart comes and says , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in English , &quot; &quot; you would ask when people were at the street saying &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
How do you do it ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better to stop and stop talking on .
So what I mean is that these were <unk> <unk> in particular .
I have a friend who speaks to me that he &apos;s got a <unk> .
Once I asked her , I asked her .
And he told me , &quot; &quot; All right , but I &apos;ve had a whole night trying to figure out how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So I think it &apos;s not who she &apos;s entitled to her husband , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that your husband is going to tell you , and it &apos;s normal that it doesn &apos;t understand it ; it &apos;s normal .
She told me , &quot; &quot; El <unk> to me , &quot; &quot; and a night , <unk> <unk> to me who could feel what I feel when I was when I was watching the <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> <unk> of this : &quot; &quot; ... <unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; ...
( Applause ) Well , what did we do to protect the Arab language ?
They will embrace a civilian society .
How many people tell me , &quot; &quot; Why ?
And we said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a problem ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a problem ? &quot;
In the campaign to preserve the Arab Spring , the following <unk> : In the campaign to preserve the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the next <unk> , the
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! Don &apos;t tell me this or this . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have that style because of that way you don &apos;t get to <unk> .
And when somebody speaks this way , they hate the Arab .
<unk> — ( Applause ) I think we want to change our reality , and be convinced that we think our reality , the aspirations and day .
It turns out that view how we think about it .
After that &apos;s got the photos of young people and girls in <unk> characters .
<unk> boys and girls &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in English .
We are very <unk> .
And any of you say , &quot; &quot; Hey , I &apos;ll tell you a word in English ! &quot; &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ll tell you what I was doing , but it was <unk> a more beautiful word , and it understood better with reality .
I &apos;m going to follow the Internet .
Or when you think that they have authority about us , or what they think they have authority about us , in which they think they have authority about us , in which they &apos;re going to make the language of us , in which they think they have authority on us , in which they &apos;re going to make the language of us , in which they think they have authority on us , in which they think they have authority on us , in which they think they have authority on us , where they &apos;re going
The creativity in the mother is the way .
So let &apos;s start with now .
One one is a novel , a novel , which has another global time .
It could take the <unk> again .
But we have to know it , and that &apos;s convinced that there &apos;s a solution , and we have a part of it .
In short , what can you do from right now ?
Let &apos;s see ... <unk> , who is <unk> ?
Please , I would argue , although my time , I had to <unk> it , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , although my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> .
But I don &apos;t write Arabic to <unk> <unk> characters with numbers .
( Applause ) This is a <unk> ! This is not a language !
You &apos;ll find them to me in a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back to that world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
<unk> babies were first to his father &apos;s father first to his father , and the babies would <unk> the first one to his father .
So when I was reading my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is okay , my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
What &apos;s happening in the mind of a baby ?
If you take this 30 years of , most people , psychologists , would say this baby is irrational , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — that I wouldn &apos;t have to account in account of somebody else &apos;s perspective or not by a <unk> process .
Over the last 20 years , the science of development has been completely this theory .
In a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of scientific scientists .
So let me give you an example of this .
One thing I could be thinking about this baby , which could be happening in his mind , is to try to figure out what &apos;s happening in the mind of a baby &apos;s mind .
So finally , one of the most difficult things , one of the most difficult things is to try to <unk> what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the hardest thing is to understand that what people think and feel it is not the same as what we think and we feel .
Anyone who &apos;s in the way of politics can tell the difficult thing I &apos;m going to work on is some people .
We wanted to know if babies and children small kids could understand this very complex idea about other people .
The question is , how can we <unk> ?
The babies don &apos;t talk about , and if we ask a child for three years that tells us what you think , just make a sense of thinking about <unk> , <unk> and things for style .
How do we do it ?
It turns out that the secret was the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , one of my students , and more I gave me to the babies two dishes with food , a <unk> , or another <unk> <unk> .
We all babies , even in Berkeley , they &apos;re like a <unk> , and I don &apos;t want to like it .
( Laughter ) And then what was <unk> was to test food from two dishes .
And it &apos;s like they love or not what we would have .
Half of the time , it &apos;s meant to <unk> them and don &apos;t eat it — as any baby or normal person .
But the other half , we had a little bit of <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , eat .
You see the stupid . <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then we found a <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s saying , it &apos;s like if you <unk> the exact opposite of the babies .
We did this with babies and 18 months .
( Laughter ) So let me ask him to your hand and say , &quot; Would you get a little bit ? &quot;
The question was , &quot; &quot; <unk> babies what do they love them ?
The surprising one was that the baby baby was a baby , and I &apos;m going to talk to you , <unk> <unk> if you were <unk> <unk> , and you can tell you that it would eat the ball .
On the other hand , the babies and the baby &apos;s 15 months ago <unk> to it if you can &apos;t understand it , as you can &apos;t understand .
And after it looked at it for a long mouse , <unk> <unk> , what thought I would love the whole world .
So there &apos;s two key data on this .
For one side is that babies &apos; baby babies have given this important thing of human nature : we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understood that they have to act to help other people to get what they were facing .
And the most interesting thing about it , is that babies and thousands of months are not going to do this ; what suggests that children from the age of being human in three months that the <unk> of the baby &apos;s 15 months ago .
So babies know , babies know more and teach us more than ever before .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that have been made in the last 20 years .
What if you can ask now now is , why kids teach so much ?
And how is it possible that they learn so much in that little time ?
I mean , the first view , babies seem quite <unk> .
And in many times sometimes , they are worse , because we have to use a lot of time and energy just in living living in alive .
If you look at the evolution of the evolution to look at the mystery of this mystery , we lost so much time finding babies <unk> , it turns out that there &apos;s a response answer to this mystery .
If we look in a different species , it &apos;s not only other <unk> like us , but it &apos;s also the other <unk> , birds , even other <unk> like the <unk> or the <unk> , it turns out that there are relationship between the <unk> of childhood and the size of the brain and the species of the species .
One example of this <unk> of these birds that you can see here .
So a band , you have the crow of New Yorkers .
<unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , sound birds .
In certain senses are as intelligent as <unk> .
And this is a bird , a very early study that has learned how to get food .
On the other hand , we have to our so-called domestic <unk> .
<unk> , like the ducks , <unk> and geese , they &apos;re <unk> like stones .
I &apos;m very good at TED <unk> , but it &apos;s not very good to do anything else .
It turns out that babies from the <unk> of New York City , the <unk> , the babies , the babies from the <unk> of New York , the <unk> , the babies from the <unk> of New York City , <unk> , and it turns out that babies from the <unk> of New York , it turns out that the babies from the <unk> of New York , it turns out that the babies from the <unk> of New York , it turns out that babies from the <unk> of New York , it turns out that babies
We realize that their mothers would take them into their mouth in their mouth until two years of life , which is a lot of time in short life in a bird .
Instead , chickens are adult a couple of months .
So for so , childhood is the reason that the <unk> do in the <unk> of the scientific journals , the chickens do in the pot of the soup .
There &apos;s something in the long time that it seems to be related to knowledge and knowledge .
What should we have for this ?
Some animals , like chickens , seem <unk> to do a very good thing .
So chickens are very good at a very good environment in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like <unk> , are not particularly good doing nothing particular , but they &apos;re very good learning about the norms of different environments .
And of course , we , human beings are very far away in there .
We have the most big brains with our bodies , much more than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , more <unk> , more <unk> , we can still survive in many more environments : we have <unk> around the planet and even face space .
And our babies and children rely on us for a lot more time than babies babies are .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So minus the 23 , we followed <unk> these <unk> in their open mouths in their open mouths .
All right , why do we look forward ?
One idea is that that strategy , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way of <unk> in this world . But it &apos;s a big <unk> : it &apos;s a very powerful way .
It turns out that until you learn everything , if you &apos;re <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t going to be good for us to get a <unk> and be thinking , &quot; Would you get a <unk> or a <unk> ? &quot;
It would be better to know that before we <unk> <unk> .
And the way that evolution <unk> this problem was , it seems to be , with a legal division .
So we have this period of time where we &apos;re completely <unk> .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . We &apos;re just learning .
And so , in adults , we can take that we learn from babies and children and put it into practice to <unk> around the world .
A way to think about this is that babies and children are small , like the department of the <unk> and <unk> of the human species .
It &apos;s the people who go forward to them , which are only having to go , learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re the production and <unk> .
We have to take all these ideas that learn from children and <unk> in practice .
Another way to see it is , instead of thinking about babies and kids as adults as adults , think of them as beings in a different developing developing state of the same species ; like the <unk> and the <unk> , the babies would be the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the very adults , and we <unk> <unk> <unk> in our very narrow way of adults .
If this is true , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows us that it is , that the kids are to learn , we can wait for a lot of learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But the real thing that the real computers are getting too much .
There &apos;s probably a revolution in our way to understand the machines .
And all of the ideas of this man , the <unk> Thomas <unk> , a statistical and rectangular mathematician in the 18th century .
Basically , <unk> has provided a mathematical process that pushes the theory of the probability of the probability and describe the way that the scientific scientists have made things in the world .
What scientists do is to make a hypothesis , something that could start .
So let me take that hypothesis with a test .
The evidence is going to change the hypothesis , and the evidence is going to change the hypothesis .
What they &apos;re doing with with new evidence that they are doing with new tests , and this is called it .
What we found was a mathematician <unk> that could do that .
And math is the basis of the best programs that we have today .
Ten years ago , <unk> babies would be doing the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , I think it &apos;s something very much like this .
I found the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculations with likely to be able to <unk> it , and so it turns out how it works .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove .
If we ask an adult about statistics , we can feel pretty stupid .
How is it possible that kids do statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine that we had to call the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a box that lights up , and it sounds like when they get rid of it was a few objects .
By using this simple machine , in my lab , and also in the lab , if we <unk> dozens of studies of research that are kids learning about the world .
It &apos;s just one that we &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> , one of my students .
If you &apos;re going to give you this detector probably probably just thinking that the way of <unk> is to put a <unk> on the detector .
But the case is that the detector work in a very strange way .
If you get a <unk> on the detector on the detector , something that we don &apos;t have in a beginning , the detector have changed two of every three times .
So let me tell you that if we put it up on it , what would it be logical , only if they changed two of every six times .
So the chance you have more likely to be surprised .
It turns out that the strategy of <unk> the object is more than another .
So we explain these data to the kids of four and a half years .
And with security , the children from four years to get the data and <unk> the object on the detector .
There are two main data in this fact .
The first one , you know that there are children from four years ago , and the first one , <unk> that &apos;s a couple of years , and the first one , you know , you &apos;re a couple of days .
They are learning to tell us .
But why are they doing complex calculations , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to <unk> it .
The second point of interesting is that they &apos;re using evidence to get an idea , a hypothesis about the world , which looks something bit likely to beginning .
In studies that make us in the lab , other similar other , we &apos;ve shown that these kids of four different are better likely to be <unk> as adults , given the same task .
In these circumstances , kids do statistics to make things about things about the world , but scientists , after all , and we wanted to see if the kids were too .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re usually called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; It has been a lot of interesting studies lately that would argue that these games are like a scientific program program .
They took one of the lab of <unk> <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to give kids the kids that are going to work , and the red triangles doesn &apos;t , until I &apos;m going to take a malfunction .
What we &apos;ll see now is this boy <unk> a little chance in two minutes of time .
Child : And so that ?
Child : Just like the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first hypothesis was <unk> .
Child : Nothing . ( Laughter ) Child , but this doesn &apos;t .
<unk> : It starts to describe the <unk> .
( Video : Why did this go ?
( Laughter ) Child : I don &apos;t understand .
<unk> : The scientific scientists recognize that face <unk> .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
<unk> : <unk> , chance two .
Child : So it has to be .
Child : Oh ... can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) <unk> : So now comes the next idea .
It <unk> the researcher that <unk> up on the other .
Nor didn &apos;t work .
Child : Oh , it &apos;s because light only goes down here , not to see it .
In this box , there &apos;s electricity , but this doesn &apos;t have it .
<unk> : Well , that would be the fourth hypothesis .
Child : Now yeah .
If you put four <unk> <unk> .
If you put four <unk> into this , you <unk> and two to the two .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s the farm .
This child is — it &apos;s a very <unk> child and <unk> , but <unk> found that it &apos;s a very typical kid .
If you look at how to play kids , if you &apos;re asking you to do something , what do they do is to experience it .
Very typical children .
Well , what do you feel like this kind of creature ?
What if you feel being one of these <unk> who may be able to test five hypotheses ?
If we analyze the theory of psychologists and philosophers , many people say babies and children are just conscious , or even not the sound .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more conscious than the adults .
This is what we know about how to act .
Consciousness and attention from an adult possible .
What happens in the adults is that when we decided something is important or relevant , <unk> attention .
And that &apos;s what we can do is that we can become <unk> and intense , as the rest of the rest of them , they belong .
We also know how this happens in the brain .
When it gets attention to something , the frontal part of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the action , is a signal that makes a little part of the brain if you get more <unk> , better to learn , better to learn , and reject the activity in the rest of the brain .
We have this way a lot of <unk> , right ? Right ?
If we look babies and kids , we see something very different .
I think babies and kids seem to have an awareness more like a torch than a focus .
<unk> babies and children would have a lot of attention to attention to one thing .
But it turns out it &apos;s very well to have a lot of data in many sources .
And if we look at your brains , what we see is that they are <unk> that they are <unk> to learning and plasticity , and the <unk> is still not the cable .
So when we say babies , and kids have problems to pay attention , which really means it costs not to pay attention .
And I &apos;m going to tell you about the interesting things that I think I could say something by just looking at what &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the type of consciousness we must expect of these <unk> that are characterized to learn .
If we want to think about a way to feel that kind of child , as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases that we &apos;re going to have a new situation in which we haven &apos;t been never ; every time you &apos;re asking them , or when we go to a city for the first time .
<unk> cases that we don &apos;t care about , but it &apos;s expanding , so it turns out that in three days in Paris , there &apos;s more awareness and experiences that every few months back in the house , looking at it , going on , going on , just like <unk> .
So right , that coffee , that TED , that you take coffee , actually turned out the effect of <unk> babies .
So how is a baby ?
It &apos;s like being boyfriend , in Paris , for the first time , after <unk> 3 <unk> .
( Laughter ) A wonderful feeling , but that sounds <unk> <unk> in the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s okay .
I don &apos;t mean too much about the <unk> that are babies .
It &apos;s okay .
We can do things like <unk> or crossing the street , alone alone .
And it has sense that we think a lot of effort to do that babies think we babies think about as adults .
But if what we want is to be like these <unk> , having the mind open , to be open to learning , imagination , imagination , innovation , innovation , perhaps , at least sometimes being able to do a little bit like children .

So these are simple objects : <unk> , keys , <unk> , lens , lens , lens , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
It &apos;s the things that victims of the Rwandan genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are the things that victims of the genocide are
We are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects , and we are all linked to these <unk> objects ,
So the fact that some victims <unk> objects would have <unk> objects like paste or <unk> with teeth is a signal that had no idea what it was .
( Laughter ) And he said to tell you that they would be <unk> <unk> that they would say they would be <unk> to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they were going to tell you that they would
And these <unk> objects of countless countless common objects from my land , and as we talk about , the <unk> <unk> bodies of the new common ones that are probably 20 years after the war .
And they are perhaps the greatest <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Over the last four years of the conflict that <unk> <unk> at the early 1990s , a <unk> citizens , <unk> most , certainly killed and other <unk> were <unk> during the operations .
Most of them have been killed , well in the early days of war , or well , the end of the conflict , and the <unk> of the conflict came out of hands .
The international world <unk> <unk> <unk> by crimes against humanity and genocide .
<unk> is the systematic destruction and <unk> in a <unk> group , political and race , <unk> and race and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and racial destruction of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and

Like the destruction of the property , the destruction of the property , the cultural <unk> , and basically any signal of their existence , how the destruction of the property , of the cultural heritage , and basically of any signal of their existence .
The genocide is not just <unk> ; it &apos;s the denial of identity .
There are , there are hints , there &apos;s no perfect crime there , there &apos;s no perfect crime , there are all hints , there &apos;s no perfect crime .
Every time the <unk> are <unk> more than their bodies are <unk> , or our <unk> and weak memory .
This <unk> objects of many common <unk> and the objective of the <unk> of objects is a single single process of genocide in the first act of genocide from the Holocaust .
No body should be able to find out or <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
One time if we had these objects that victims would take care of their own <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> these objects that victims would take care of their own <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> them <unk> into plastic bags like you see in <unk> scholarships .
It was <unk> as a proper tools of victims of victims , but also as evidence of <unk> in the war of the war of war , but also as a test test in the war of the war .
Sometimes it &apos;s called <unk> to physically physically , but the visual view is a difficult process , <unk> and painful process is a difficult process , and sometimes it &apos;s called the <unk> process .
Once we <unk> , doctors and lawyers care about them to be <unk> the narrative of the narrative of storytelling .
A lot of <unk> , even though you don &apos;t create or just <unk> out of view and the mind of the mind and the mind of the mind and the mind that you don &apos;t create or just <unk> out of your mind and the mind that you don &apos;t create or just <unk> out of your mind and the mind that you don &apos;t either create or just <unk> out of your mind and the mind that you don &apos;t create or just <unk> out of your mind and the mind that you don &apos;t create or
A few years ago , I decided to get rid of every single object to create a simple archive that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a few years ago , I decided to get rid of each other , and a few years ago , I decided to get rid of each other , and a couple of years ago , I decided to get rid of each other , and a few years ago , I decided to get rid of each other , and a few years ago , I decided
I want to promote the <unk> <unk> <unk> of how to promote <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , I want to promote <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , I want to promote <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , I want to promote <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , I want to promote <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , I want to promote <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , I want to promote <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
And in this case , you can recognize objects or at least that the photos are like , and in this case , you can recognize objects or at least the photos of it .
The picture is empathy and the familiarity of these <unk> objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , an expert , if you want , and the outcome is the most similar possible to a document .
When they were told the same way they &apos;re going to <unk> bodies and these common objects , when they were throwing their bodies into their bodies and these ordinary objects , when they were throwing their eyes on their bodies , they &apos;re going to <unk> their bodies .
In all his simplicity , these objects are <unk> for the identity of the victims of the victims of the world that these people have been <unk> for the most <unk> of the victims of the world that are the <unk> for the most <unk> of the victims of the world .
Thank you very much .

I was told that the months I didn &apos;t know that the months , and the months , I didn &apos;t think the time was much more memorable .

I &apos;m here to share my picture .
This is photograph ?
Because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take away with their cameras .
With all my interest on the picture started when I put my first high-speed camera at 15 years .
<unk> with my passion before the print , it &apos;s a little bit different , because by using a process was more well in planning .
And when a picture is a picture of a camera , the process finishes when you get <unk> .
To me , I was more likely to see with being in the place in the <unk> moment .
You know what you could do .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process was going to get the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like this : a building in a very <unk> road .
But it &apos;s an unexpected gyrus .
And despite it , it stays a feast .
Or photos like these — dark and colorful , but all with the same common objective to keep the realism level .
When I say I &apos;ll tell you about it .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually be captured , but I always want it to be captured in some way as a picture .
You know what you have to think about a moment to discover the magic .
So this has more to do with capture an idea that we have to capture a very moment .
But what is the magic that makes it sound ?
You have to see what details or the colors ?
Do you have to see the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
The point is the illusion .
But at the end of our way , it &apos;s about our way of interpreting the world and how it can be produced in a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s really not about realistic if it &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the basics are very simple .
I &apos;m going to <unk> as a <unk> of reality in which we take different bits of reality and us together to create an alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
So here we have three physical physical objects , something we can all relate to live in a three-dimensional world .
But they &apos;re in a way you can create something that even looks like three-dimensional .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t exist .
So it &apos;s going to make our brain because the brain just doesn &apos;t pay for the fact that it really doesn &apos;t have sense .
And I see the same process by combining pictures .
It &apos;s actually a lot of different realities .
So the things that make a picture look like realistic sounds , I think it &apos;s the ones we don &apos;t even think , the things that we don &apos;t even think about it in our lives .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have in account this , because of the contrary <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to say that there are three simple approaches that follow up to the realistic results .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first <unk> is that the dollar photos have to have the same view .
Secondly , the combined photos must have the same kind of light .
And these two pictures would get rid of these requirements ; they have been <unk> at the same time and the same type of light .
The third point is to do it impossible to tell you where they start and do the different images in a perfect place .
It has to be impossible to say how to <unk> the picture .
<unk> of the color , the contrast , the contrast , the <unk> that there &apos;s between the different images , by adding <unk> <unk> as the depth of the field , colors and noise , <unk> the limits between the different images and we make it look like a single picture , despite fact that a single picture of reality can have hundreds of layers .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) It could be <unk> that this is the picture of a landscape and the lower is what it was manipulated .
But this picture is absolutely fully written by the pictures of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that &apos;s easier to create a place that would be , because one doesn &apos;t need to commit the ideas that has in your head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew I had a lot of months to design , to find the different places for the bits of the <unk> .
For example , the fish was captured in a way to catch fish .
The back is a different .
The <unk> part was captured in a stone .
And yeah , even I &apos;ve done the house of the <unk> of the island of the island for <unk> more <unk> .
So to get a realistic result , I don &apos;t think we &apos;re planning .
Every time it starts with a <unk> , a sense .
So there &apos;s a lot of different pictures .
And here every piece of sound is very well .
If you make a good job at taking the photos , you can be very beautiful and very realistic .
All the tools are there , and the only thing that we limit is our imagination .
Thank you .
