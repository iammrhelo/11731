It was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he was a Sunday afternoon , and he
It &apos;s been <unk> scientific <unk> in the <unk> , the Union <unk> <unk> .
I was going to <unk> my job , but precisely that day we &apos;ve been <unk> a little bit <unk> .
So I would go to my fellow my fellow Chris <unk> .
Chris handed me over 30 years to work in the <unk> , so the same way they knew how they work .
I told Chris I felt a little bit <unk> .
I was going to take a series of questions about the science tracking science and freedoms <unk> : very interesting .
But I wanted to tell you that the <unk> problem is a more expensive problem , a way that could reveal a difference .
Chris was straight to the big and asked , &quot; &quot; What are the five that &apos;s the five that are the five ones that are more <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , is the global burden of genetic technology , the <unk> and ...
It was also a great thing , the job of the <unk> as a circuit detector and ...
Of course , the topic of genetic <unk> . &quot; &quot; We <unk> genetic ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Yes , that &apos;s , for us to humans . &quot;
No !
&quot; &quot; Did you say the American government <unk> <unk> signs of the human body ?
It can &apos;t be &quot; &quot; â€” I would go to my <unk> and I &apos;d say Chris , three papers .
And 20 minutes later , he got him to <unk> .
&quot; <unk> ! You had right ! &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s that Chris &apos;s a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost anything about the whole of barrels of patents , nothing about genetic .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t <unk> , much less <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;ve seen it there was a lot of learning before I had to get one .
First , we had to know exactly what we &apos;re asking when somebody <unk> a gene .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the most all are called &quot; &quot; DNA <unk> , &quot; &quot; or it &apos;s a piece of DNA that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; DNA . &quot; &quot; or a piece of DNA that would have been <unk> from a cell .
The teachers are saying , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t give you the genes of your body , will give you the genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , but the problem is the <unk> problem that we need to <unk> the genes for <unk> .
And the patents is not going to offer a particular gene in particular , but all the possible ego of that gene .
What does this mean ?
Because you can &apos;t spend your genes at a doctor and you would argue that the <unk> , to see if they were prone to the <unk> of the patent troll .
It also means that the patent troll has the right to stop that gene to stop in research or clinical trials .
We found that these <unk> , the kid , private companies , will make an deprived of the human genome was to make it <unk> .
We have the case of <unk> , a small bit of 10 years with a <unk> disease , a heart disease that &apos;s not about it , it can elicit the sudden death .
The company that we &apos;ve been exposed to two genes associated with this disease <unk> a test for syndrome .
But then he went on <unk> and never came to <unk> .
But the company that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Two years of a car could be .
During that time , I had died of <unk> long without a diagnose .
<unk> <unk> were a problem that we would have to make patients .
We have any form of living in front of us ?
Yeah , it turns out that the Supreme Court has stopped clear in a long list of the previous cases , which is a series of things that are not <unk> .
You can &apos;t <unk> products of nature : air , the water , minerals , the elements of the altitude , the elements of the grocery table .
Not not the laws of nature : the law of gravity , and they ate <unk> .
And I &apos;m very big things , and you need to be a grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you need to be the grasp of all , and you
In our opinion view DNA , the most fundamental lives of the most fundamental lives , that encode the production of all our proteins , is so much a product of nature as a law of nature , regardless of that if we were <unk> in our bodies or the bottom of a <unk> .
To get better , we would <unk> around the country to talk to the country to talk to experts : scientists , doctors , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers , lawyers
Most of the most <unk> we had really been in a point of a political view , and when we less importantly , since a legal view of view .
And they all thought the chance of going to come with our health in this topic were so many like scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the <unk> <unk> leads to give them over 20 to 20 years .
It was literally thousands of more genes of human genes .
The <unk> court was very <unk> in the status quo of biotech industry on this practice , and the whole whole thing to <unk> the <unk> <unk> year after the Congress had to go to never meet .
In short , the courts weren &apos;t going to be willing to get willing to get rid of these patents .
But it &apos;s not me about Chris , fear of fear , and we were told us , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not enough , &quot; &quot; but we would have more <unk> to follow .
So we started to see our cause .
<unk> by <unk> patents to be : <unk> <unk> <unk> by some technical topic , dark and messy .
We don &apos;t have to take us that kind of causes , we think we think we can actually get a lot more .
It &apos;s about the scientific freedom , the human progress and the rights of the patients .
So we decided to open a causes that would not be like the ones that are in charge of patents , but a cause the <unk> of the rights of the <unk> .
We would have to identify a <unk> <unk> <unk> that was advocating by bringing their patents to the back of a <unk> and experts who would have been <unk> to the courts like these patents , and the innovation .
We think the ideal candidate to <unk> was <unk> <unk> , a company with the headquarters in Salt Lake City , <unk> .
We &apos;ve been able to <unk> the barrels of two genes , the genes we have and the <unk> .
Women with the right mutations in these genes are more likely to get cancer and <unk> cancer .
A total of <unk> is a total <unk> over the U.S. <unk> <unk> in the United States .
They did that very much made out of <unk> <unk> test tests .
We &apos;ve got many money for their exams : plus 3,000 dollars .
I had to share their data data with the international scientific community .
And it &apos;s about the worse , for a period of a few years , <unk> <unk> to facilitate his exam to that <unk> mutations that were identified by a team of researchers in France .
So I would argue that during that period for a few years , until a 12 percent of the women who are going to have made an apple feedback , a negative result that should be positive .
This is <unk> <unk> .
The sister of <unk> , Eileen , developed cancer , <unk> cancer .
And Babbage &apos;s <unk> was negative .
The family <unk> .
The most likely was that cancer wasn &apos;t there in the family , so the other members of the family couldn &apos;t have to do the test .
But two years later , <unk> <unk> a <unk> cancer in American state .
It turned out that the photographic <unk> <unk> between that 12 percent of people who have received a negative negative result .
If it used to <unk> the outcome right , it would make a test , and would prevent their cancer <unk> .
They could have <unk> these problems .
We <unk> genetic genetic modification , the global economy of the world is going to be a global basis of global health , political organizations , four scientific organizations that are creating more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals , and that is the individual , and they &apos;re not able to pay for a second view that they couldn &apos;t afford to give it for a little bit of a little bit of view that they couldn &apos;t afford to give it for a second of a little bit of view that they couldn &apos;t afford to give
One of the main challenges that we &apos;re faced when we prepare this case was to think the way to explain the science .
To argue that what I &apos;ve done was not a <unk> , and that the genes we have <unk> was products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like , what is a gene ? What is the DNA ? What is the DNA ?
How about DNA , and why not do it is a <unk> ?
We spend hours and hours of our <unk> and experts , trying to give us the way to explain these concepts of <unk> <unk> .
And at the end end , by the <unk> , the <unk> , the gold .
So <unk> DNA is like <unk> gold from a <unk> or the river of a river .
You can see it <unk> the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t get the gold .
So , it has worked out if I was working to extract the gold gold ; it &apos;s not if it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s the gold .
And the gold , once from , from , you can use it in all sorts of things in the world that you couldn &apos;t even even when she was on the mountain ; he &apos;s going to make it <unk> , for example , you can &apos;t <unk> the gold , because it follows be gold .
In 2009 , we were ready to present the case .
He was interviewing me from the Federal Federal Reserve in New York City , and the case <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the
In March of 2010 , the judge issued you off his <unk> : <unk> pages . A total <unk> to us .
When you saw your opinion , you would be able to tell you how to describe the science in the case .
I mean , our report â€” it was quite good , but not so good .
How could we develop a sense of this deep knowledge of the subject in the way of how little time ?
We can &apos;t imagine how it would be so much like this .
So it turned out that the <unk> with the <unk> was that he was working on that , not only lawyer â€” was scientific .
And it wasn &apos;t just science â€” I had a PhD in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Wow , he &apos;s lucky !
So he <unk> him from the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the Federal Reserve .
And here &apos;s the things that I &apos;m really interesting about .
First , in a life moment of this case , the U.S. government changed out .
In the district court , the government issued you a report the <unk> to <unk> .
But in direct <unk> to his own head of <unk> , the government would have an report when you would say that this topic was the <unk> of the decision &apos;s decision to the <unk> of the district &apos;s decision , and he would say that DNA was not allowed to be <unk> .
This was very important , and absolutely unexpected .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the Federal Reserve gets all cases of patents , and it &apos;s called his <unk> very , very much the <unk> .
So even with this event <unk> , I was getting married .
And so that was .
More or less .
The decision was about two on one .
But the two <unk> that voted against us , they did have been understood by totally different .
The first one , the judge <unk> his own and new theory , totally wrong , totally wrong .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We &apos;ve never seen that , so I didn &apos;t have sense of it , so I didn &apos;t have meaning .
The other judge , the <unk> Moore , he said that we were going to <unk> it in how to be the DNA <unk> a product of nature .
But I don &apos;t want to take a lot of the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third one , the judge , I &apos;m really excited .
You have to present it to a question that would be in the question that you respond to the <unk> .
So the general question was , these questions would be a paragraph in a paragraph , a lot of <unk> , and so much .
We did what &apos;s going to be the most short question that I &apos;ve never experienced .
Five words : Are they going to be <unk> , we are going to make us human genes ?
When Chris asked me what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I think I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Is the DNA <unk> ? &quot; &quot; No .
I want to tell you that the <unk> may be the same reaction I &apos;ve had , the day that I &apos;ve been talking about seven years ago .
The Supreme Court ruled by the way of one percent of the cases that we had , and they &apos;ll hear our own .
It &apos;s the day of <unk> <unk> and it was very , very exciting â€” with many people outside , people who have to go to waiting for two : 30 of the morning to try to get in the <unk> .
Two organizations against chest cancer , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Chris and I would run together in the hallway , moments before he was able to defend the most important case of his career .
I was much more nervous than he .
But all that panic <unk> was when I went in the room and I saw my whole bunch of <unk> <unk> : women who knew that the most time of their <unk> histories , the females who were far away from their <unk> histories and <unk> to be able to make a <unk> , voluntary hair , a <unk> , a spectrum that would have been able to recover the court .
In the room also were three leaders of the Human Genome leaders , the <unk> of the DNA , James Watson , who would give you a report to court , when you would tell you that we &apos;re going to be a <unk> to court , where you would tell you that genes was a &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of communities represented in the room and the <unk> that each of the <unk> has been in the room .
<unk> was <unk> .
Chris claimed he claimed that brilliant .
But for me , the most ideal of the Supreme Court was to understand the <unk> of Supreme Court trying to understand the DNA <unk> , through a series of <unk> <unk> and dialogues of <unk> , in a very similar way of how our brain made our legal team for the last seven years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the isolation of the DNA with a <unk> plant .
The judge was <unk> with a baseball <unk> from a tree from a tree .
And what was the doubt was my favorite moment , the <unk> <unk> that the DNA <unk> was the <unk> DNA . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we got that day of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but we never could get it to the outcome : nine to the scratch .
A natural segment of DNA is a product of nature and it &apos;s not just a <unk> of it as only because it was <unk> .
And what is more , it was not made anything . &quot; &quot; Now , the <unk> and four hours after the decision , five labs were used to <unk> the exam to the <unk> genes .
Some of them would have been <unk> the most cheaper exams than <unk> .
Some of you would have an <unk> test and <unk> <unk> .
But the decision &apos;s decision was to be beyond <unk> .
It &apos;s been <unk> with a <unk> practice that would have been <unk> genetic genes in the United States .
They would argue that the innovation and the research , biomedical research .
And they helped patients like <unk> , <unk> and Eileen had access to exams who needed .
A few weeks later , a few weeks later that the court was asked his decision , I got a little package in the email of the email .
It was a <unk> teacher , a teacher at University of Duke and one of the first people I was and Chris went to visit to visit him , a teacher from him to and I was a first one of the first people I had and Chris <unk> , a teacher from England and a <unk> teacher , a teacher from England and a <unk> teacher , a teacher from England and one of the first people I was and Chris <unk> , a teacher from the University of <unk> and one of the first people I was
( Laughter ) It was a lot of this case .
And part of what we gave us the courage to figure out that the risks we were doing right .
The process was about eight years since the beginning to end , with many <unk> and <unk> in the way .
Of course , the lucky thing to help , but have been the communities that we have , and the <unk> we &apos;ve given , the ones that have given us to the .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Hi . Today , let me show you a <unk> of my projects , made it in the interface with the Danish <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We were going to call it <unk> &amp; <unk> and we live in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , what I call &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &#93; . &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> â™«
When I grew up , the thing was the worst and you &apos;re seeing it as a way of control .
So of course , I couldn &apos;t say nothing never because he &apos;s a very <unk> figure in the family .
What &apos;s most bothered me and <unk> was his use of the phone .
He was <unk> <unk> and <unk> what I had <unk> the number for him .
It &apos;s the answer and as you &apos;ll see my great guy , <unk> , &quot; &quot; The phone guy . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they &apos;re missing two people to use .
It &apos;s exactly the way my great uncle uses a <unk> to a person .
The problem is that when I was home and I went to college , I started to have less their designs .
So I did a <unk> machine writing with that he could give their commands to <unk> and <unk> all around the world through emails .
What I had to do was to take a paper , put the paper in the car , write your email into your car , write your email or command and pull the paper .
This device will take away the person in a lot of the letter in a lot of feedback .
So here you can see that there &apos;s a lot of electronic courses that understood all the action of <unk> and <unk> it in digital .
So my uncle just is this <unk> interface .
And since then , the object has to be great and having a touch of <unk> , as I like to my uncle , as I like to my uncle .
The next job is a device by announcing to the sound that we call <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with the <unk> of being surrounded by a <unk> and sensitive creatures .
This works like this . We have these <unk> here on the wall and behind , we have these little creatures that are <unk> .
Instead , it &apos;s actually <unk> , <unk> .
And if you &apos;re happier , even <unk> <unk> .
And the first sound , it &apos;s been a new .
So we have these <unk> in three walls walls in a room .
And we had 500 of these little <unk> <unk> <unk> behind .
And so that &apos;s how it works .
This is a video dune dune dune .
When you hear silence , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when you &apos;re quiet , you go back to <unk> <unk> , and when you get quiet , you see it in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s quiet , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s quiet , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s quiet , you go back to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when there &apos;s quiet , you go
And it &apos;s just going to be <unk> and <unk> as humans or the real creatures .
And let me tell you the sounds that the <unk> was just a little bit .
It doesn &apos;t look at the sounds of the bottom .
You &apos;ll take a train train in a moment when you don &apos;t smoke .
( noise ) But yeah , yeah , the sounds in the first plan .
( <unk> ) We work very hard to do the most realistic thing possible .
Each of them has their own behavior , the psyche , the changes , our mood , etc .
This is a very premature prototype .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We did not have to connect to people , but we saw that people were quite a lot of child and child with them .
This is a video device called &quot; &quot; The <unk> person . &quot; &quot; We were quite intrigued with <unk> &apos;s idea of invisibility .
How would it be possible to be able to experiment ?
We worked with a <unk> company in surveillance cameras and we asked them that we would take software with a camera that could look at people in the room , follow them to these people in the room , then they &apos;re going to be invisible .
And I &apos;m going to show you a very premature prototype prototype .
And the right , you can see my colleague <unk> , who , in fact , is in space .
And the left , you &apos;ll see the video <unk> where the camera makes it invisible .
It was going to sit in the room . Wow , I &apos;ll help you .
You can see how the camera goes and the <unk> .
It &apos;s a premature video , so I don &apos;t just get the <unk> and all of that , but it turns out it quickly , more on .
This first got a camera , where there was a camera looking at space and we had a monitor in every wall .
And second people would go in the room , they &apos;re getting themselves in the monitor , except by a difference , a person was constantly invisible to you who wants to take a room in the room .
This work is called &quot; &quot; The shadow of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost as a <unk> of paper , like a child &apos;s printed , a <unk> or sun .
So this object seemed to be very strong and robust and side , almost quite weak .
People are going to take away in the room and almost the <unk> thought that it was some <unk> .
But instead of black , they would take care of your own wall in a dead form .
And I was going to turn it down and always .
( Laughter ) This work is a pre-competitive man of a setback .
His head is so heavy , full thinking of heavy thoughts , which seems to fall in his <unk> and his body grows out of it almost like a plant .
What it does is to move around from his head as if he was handed away a very <unk> motion and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s how much that circle .
Because if that circle didn &apos;t go there and the soil outside the ground , they &apos;re going to go to free through space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
It &apos;s an example , and when people comes in the room , the brain is the right thing .
And so , very slowly , in minutes , it &apos;s powerfully , powerfully , it turns out it &apos;s the point of falling .
This is an important moment because we wanted to infuse the viewer into a lifetime of almost going and help or save the subject .
But unless you don &apos;t even need it , it &apos;s even one of it .
This work was a technical challenge to us and we worked very hard , as in most of our jobs , as in most of our jobs , for years to get an mechanical dynamics .
It was very important to us to establish the exact moment in the exact moment in which we <unk> , because if we were making it , you would be able to get enough , you don &apos;t just notice that <unk> , then you don &apos;t have to be able to get that <unk> , or that effect of wanting to go the help .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video , fast video where we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . I &apos;ll go .
Now it &apos;s going to be going to nervous , so that &apos;s going to take it .
But you don &apos;t need to do , because it can &apos;t make it for itself .
This is a job with which we &apos;ve been very intrigued by the <unk> skin with thousands of different <unk> <unk> from the fiber of optical fiber fiber fiber of optical fiber known as the night sky .
And it &apos;s right on the night &apos;s right .
So I would ask this around a drop in a drop of <unk> , which was <unk> from the household .
The idea was really <unk> , far as cold , distant and abstract , like the universe with a <unk> bear , which is very comforting and intimate .
And the idea was that somewhere in the moment of a bear and almost the way of a bear and almost <unk> as a hole in space , as if you were able to see a brilliant night sky .
This is the last job , even in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> space . &quot; &quot; Imagine a <unk> like this in the middle of the room , and it &apos;s also a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a cube twice twice twice as high and four times its volume .
This object is in constant , and we &apos;re going to create a dynamic with people moving out of <unk> , as if they were told to afford a secret in their bodies or something like this .
We worked with a lot of technology , but it &apos;s really not about how much it is because we &apos;re very suffering in our work for years and years .
But we &apos;re using it because we &apos;re interested in the way that we help us make us emotions and patterns of behavior in these creatures that we &apos;ve created .
When a creature comes up to the mind , and almost like the creation process was discovering the way that this creature wants to be found that this creature wants to take and how to move on .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to start writing a little bit by <unk> , not technology , and all of the need of you is this : that &apos;s a lot of ways that we &apos;ve been in .
But before I was <unk> , I want to be able to take your body to and what you &apos;re doing with it .
So , do you know , how many of you are in some way ?
<unk> , the scanners , the scanners , the <unk> <unk> .
Sometimes we put their arms like this .
Sometimes I would have been <unk> . ( Laughter ) I &apos;ll tell you .
It would be attention to what we &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to go back to this in minutes and I hope that if we were going to <unk> a little bit can change the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re going to get rid of body language and put it into body language and then we &apos;re going to look especially your body language of other people .
You know , I &apos;m going to <unk> â€” this , wow , wow â€” ( Laughter ) a little programmer , a <unk> , a <unk> , a little bit of eye , or even something like a baby .
Narrator : So here are now coming to the number 10 .
This police has lucky and give your hand to the president of the United States .
There comes the first Prime Minister â€” No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy <unk> : I &apos;m not . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy <unk> , or his <unk> , or his <unk> , can us talk for weeks and weeks .
It even the BBC and the New York Times , the <unk> and the New York Times .
So when you think about speech , you don &apos;t want to be verbal language or body language â€” that we called language , we &apos;re going to talk about language , so that &apos;s so much of communication .
When we talk about communication is we think of interactions .
What do you work ? &quot; &quot; Is me uncomfortable your body language ?
What do you love my ?
There are reason to believe that this is true of this approach .
Sociologists spend a lot of time we spend a lot of time in the world , or other people , or other people , about the <unk> .
We do <unk> and <unk> language language .
These <unk> can predict <unk> matter in life as the ones who are <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or who we ask a quote .
For example <unk> <unk> , a researcher at the University of <unk> , demonstrates that when someone sees 30 seconds of videos without their <unk> on the <unk> of the doctor &apos;s <unk> , if that doctor will be <unk> or not .
So you don &apos;t have to see so much if the doctor was or not <unk> but with the same one person and as <unk> .
Even more <unk> , Alex <unk> , of Princeton , <unk> that the <unk> of political candidates in a second 70 percent of the outcome of career , and the Senate of the U.S. and even in the digital <unk> , the <unk> <unk> used to be used to the <unk> of that <unk> .
If you do a bad use of them is bad idea , right ?
Much of language doesn &apos;t verbal is to talk about how to connect to others , as we would get to ourselves and what are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other audience in which we can &apos;t afford to understand our language doesn &apos;t verbal , that we are .
We &apos;re going to give our language not verbal , verbal , and our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
So what language doesn &apos;t mean ? I &apos;m not talking about ?
It &apos;s a social system , and I study the <unk> and I teach a drawing school with business , so that was inevitable that I was inevitable that I was inevitable .
They were going to get rid of the color of the power and <unk> them .
What are the ones not verbal power and <unk> ?
Well , why are this .
In the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expansion , you have to see the expansion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expansion , you have to see the expansion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expansion , you have to see the expansion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expansion , you have to see the expansion , and in the animal kingdom , you have to see with the expansion , you have
So with a big , <unk> , <unk> space , we &apos;re just going to be a lot of space , <unk> , <unk> space , basically <unk> .
It &apos;s about <unk> .
And it works like this in the animal kingdom , and it works like this in the animal kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom , and it works like this in the world kingdom
Not only only to <unk> .
Humans do the same . ( Laughter ) They &apos;re going to be there so that when they have a permanent way and also when you feel powerful at the moment .
This is especially interesting because we show ourselves the ancient and universal , universal , that are these kinds of power .
This expression , whose <unk> speech was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk> , and this expression , he was studied by Jessica <unk>
I tell you that so much the people who are there as much as people who are blind , they &apos;re blind , they &apos;re blind , even when they win a physical competition .
So when you look at the goal of the goal and win no matter if you never saw it , you never saw it .
They &apos;re like this .
<unk> arms in your chest , the cheese is a high .
What we do is we do when we feel helpless ?
We do just the opposite .
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> little .
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> with who &apos;s our next .
And so the animals like humans do the same .
And this is what happens when we all &apos;re all able to know with helplessness .
What we tend to do when it &apos;s about power is <unk> language is not verbal .
So if somebody shows that we are very powerful with us , we tend to get smaller .
We do the opposite .
If I can see this behavior in class , that would be ?
They announced that students from MBA to <unk> all language will not allow power .
There are people who are <unk> from the <unk> , drop in the class , <unk> in the middle before I start to meet the class , as if we were to take space .
When they sit , they seem to expand .
It &apos;s going to get it like this .
So there are other people who are <unk> <unk> .
He would put in his face and his body , sit in the chair and speak it up , and they &apos;re going to make it the way that you get your hand .
So here you just just two things .
One of you won &apos;t get you wrong .
You &apos;ll have to see with sex .
Women are more likely to do that men .
The women will always be fewer powerful with men , so that &apos;s not surprising .
But the other thing that I noticed is that it seems to be connected to the stage of the students and with their level of <unk> .
And this is very important in the class of MBA because it &apos;s the <unk> account for the media .
The business schools have tried to fight the difference of the second .
<unk> women and men were equally <unk> and then watch these differences in the notes , which would be <unk> in part of the <unk> .
So I started asking them : if there &apos;s people who come to that attitude and <unk> , it &apos;s going to <unk> it , and I was going to <unk> it , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , and if there &apos;s the <unk> : if there &apos;s people who come together with that attitude and <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> : if there &apos;s people who come
What would we do is possible to do that other <unk> and that are helping us to participate more ?
My collaborator <unk> <unk> , who is in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can &apos;t afford to do it .
I mean , you can do it just for a moment and experience a result in your behavior that makes you feel more powerful ?
We know language doesn &apos;t verbal <unk> , but we think other people feel that other people feel and they think there are many tests .
But our question was : <unk> language doesn &apos;t argue what we feel and we think of ourselves ourselves ?
There &apos;s evidence that this is .
For example , we said when we &apos;re happy , but also when we &apos;re happy to laugh about it as a dollar to your teeth , it &apos;s <unk> to feel happy .
It works in the two <unk> .
When it comes to power , it &apos;s also working on the two <unk> .
When we feel powerful is more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we &apos;re going to be powerful , it &apos;s more likely to really feel powerful .
Well the second question was , well , we &apos;ve already known the mind of our bodies , but it &apos;s so much so much that the body would get to your mind ?
And when I say , in the case of powerful , I &apos;m talking about ?
Well , I talk about thoughts and feelings and feelings of things that make that thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I talk about the hormones .
How is the mind of powerful compared to what are not ?
The powerful people tend to be , not surprising , more <unk> and secure , more optimistic .
They have the feeling they &apos;re going to win even in sound games .
It also tend to think of a more abstract way .
There are many differences . They &apos;ll get more risks .
There &apos;s a lot of difference from the differences between the powerful and the ones that are not .
We &apos;ll also create the differences in two key hormones : testosterone , which is the hormone of the <unk> , and the <unk> , which is the hormone of stress .
The males are actually focused on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , they have high levels of testosterone and levels of low levels of <unk> . And the powerful leaders are powerful and effective and effective leaders . And the powerful leaders are powerful and effective and effective and effective leaders .
What does this mean ? By talking about power , I &apos;m talking about the testosterone , because I had to see with <unk> .
But the power of power has to do with our response to stress .
We want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with high levels of testosterone , but by leveraging stress ?
Have you probably not , true ?
We want a person who &apos;s powerful , <unk> and dominant , but not a <unk> , a person who is quiet .
We know that in the <unk> <unk> , if a <unk> has to take control , if somebody has to take control , take a sudden of that paper , you take a sudden that paper , the deadline of the day , his testosterone and his <unk> was equally .
We have this evidence , that body can make it <unk> the mind , at least , facial energy , and also that the paper paper can get the mind .
So what happens when you get a paper change ? What happens if you do a minimum , like this little <unk> or <unk> ?
<unk> : I want to take you for two minutes you would say , that will make you more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did .
We decided to bring people to the lab and to make a small experiment , these people , the ones we &apos;ve been able to do , for two minutes , both of the <unk> , they either have a very much way of going on five of these <unk> , but they &apos;re only two .
This is one .
A couple of more a couple more dollars a couple more dollars a couple more dollars a couple more dollars a couple more dollars a couple more dollars .
The <unk> press <unk> <unk> .
So here we have a couple more .
You can be standing , or sitting .
So here are the <unk> <unk> .
Now we &apos;re going to get small .
This is very low power .
When I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , really .
This is what happens .
They come , they go , they would run a jar , and they &apos;ll take it for two minutes , and you &apos;ll take it for two minutes , you have to do this . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the photos of the <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to be <unk> with a concept of power .
We want to feel the power .
They &apos;re going to be this two minutes .
So I would argue , how powerful you feel ? &quot; &quot; then we put the chance to bet , the end we take another <unk> of spit .
That &apos;s all . This is all the experiment .
This is what we found .
They &apos;ll take the risk , put it ; we found that when they are in a position of high power position to bet the 86 percent .
When they are in the ground <unk> , only 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant distinction .
Let &apos;s look what we found with testosterone .
It &apos;s called the normal situation by getting , the powerful people who have an increase in 20 percent and the <unk> level of 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and we &apos;ll make that change .
Now the results with <unk> .
The most powerful level of age , the more we have <unk> over the age of 15 percent of the age of 15 .
Just two minutes to have a <unk> , if you &apos;re prone to your brain to make it <unk> , secure or <unk> or <unk> , or well , or well as the evil .
We all know that feeling , right ?
We will argue that our language will not allow us to educate ourselves as we &apos;re not only too much , but we are ourselves .
The body can get the mind .
The next question , of course , is â€” can a gesture of power in a couple of many things in many ways ?
This is the lab , this experiment , are just two minutes .
Where can you really apply this ?
That &apos;s what you care about .
We think where we need is to take care of what we &apos;ve been able to do , as the social <unk> , <unk> social <unk> , we think where we have to take care of ourselves as the <unk> social <unk> , we think where we need to be in <unk> in the <unk> , we think where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we think where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we think where we are in <unk> in the <unk> , we think where we are in <unk> in the <unk>
I would sit in the <unk> in the <unk> , where you would hear your friends .
To the teenagers , the teenagers are in the room .
For some people &apos;s talking about the school .
It can be the present to the present or to give a talk about how this or going to an interview interview .
It &apos;s a one that most people who thought most of people are challenged because many of it , the interview interview .
So we tested the results , the press <unk> and said , well , this is what you do when you go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) We &apos;re all going to <unk> and said , not , by God , not , not what we wanted to say .
So many of the reasons , don &apos;t actually do it .
Again , it &apos;s not about getting to other people .
It &apos;s about to talk to you .
What do you before going to an interview interview ? We &apos;ll say this .
You &apos;re sitting . You &apos;ll take your iPhone â€” you &apos;re not going to your iPhone , you &apos;re not going to leave it outside .
You can ask your messages , you &apos;re going to <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> , when really what you should be doing is , maybe in the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be wrong , maybe in the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a little bit .
So that &apos;s what we want to grade , is it ?
They were told the people the lab , and they were <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the lab , and they were <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I was going to show you five minutes of <unk> .
They also also <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> to not give verbal verbal expression .
Imagine that one person interview .
Over five minutes , nothing is worse than you would have <unk> .
People are going to get this .
It &apos;s what Marianne &apos;s called &quot; &quot; being in the West . &quot; &quot; This goes out to the <unk> .
This is the interview to the interview , because we wanted to see what we &apos;ve been trying to see what we &apos;re going to do .
We have analysts , the Dozo , four on total .
They didn &apos;t know the hypothesis . Don &apos;t know the conditions .
They don &apos;t have a sense that position made of a position and then end up all the undersea , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , &quot; &quot; all of the <unk> of power .
We don &apos;t want to hire <unk> .
It would have a much more positive measurement of a general . &quot; &quot; So what was happening ?
It &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
It &apos;s the presence that you would call the speech .
Because the astrolabe , all of these <unk> <unk> would be asking : Did you want to be the speech ?
Do you know ? What ratings do you have ?
These things don &apos;t affect . This and what it causes .
This kind of thing .
Every person would get itself , basically .
They just remember what they are .
It would make their ideas , for themselves , without any extra .
So this is what it does or <unk> the effect .
When I talk to people about this , that our bodies change our mind and behavior can change our way to be , it &apos;s like &quot; &quot; It looks . &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah ?
I <unk> : You &apos;ll be able to do it until you do it .
I &apos;m not like this .
I don &apos;t want to get there and <unk> like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you as an <unk> .
I don &apos;t want to get there to feel that I wasn &apos;t supposed to be there .
This is very important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an <unk> and about feeling like I didn &apos;t want to be there .
When I was 19 , I was 19 , a terrible accident .
I was sitting in it and I found a few <unk> <unk> .
I was wearing a car card .
I was in intensive care of a <unk> in head , and I was told that my <unk> <unk> <unk> two standard . It was very traumatic .
I was asking my son because I was going to <unk> as <unk> , and he was <unk> girl .
So I had to walk from college and tried to go back .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you stop to the career .
You have to accept that there are other things you can do , but in your case , it &apos;s not . &quot; &quot; I had to deal with that , and I have to say that you &apos;re going to take it up to your identity , what really you are , who are , who are to me , that I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be smart , you know , that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s more incorrect you can do .
<unk> totally helpless .
So I worked and I worked and I worked , and I had to <unk> and I worked , and I worked .
And I finally went to college .
I took four years later , and I was able to convince somebody , my <unk> from the cellar , <unk> <unk> , so I was in Princeton , and I was in Princeton , and I felt like I didn &apos;t want to be there .
The night before the first of the first three days , I was , the night before the first of the first of the first days , and the night before the exhibition was the first of the first three days , and the night before the exhibition was the first of the first three days , and the night before the exhibition was the first of the first three days , and the night before the exhibition was the first of the first three days , and the night before the exhibition was the first of the first
It &apos;s like this .
I had so much afraid of excluded the next day that I would say , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll leave it . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll not leave it , because I think I &apos;ll make it , because I think it &apos;s just me , because I think it &apos;s just me , because I think it &apos;s just me , because I think it &apos;s just me , because I think it &apos;s just me , because I think it &apos;s just me , because I think it
You &apos;ll be going to be , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;ll make all the exhibitions that you would have <unk> .
It &apos;s just prevented , and to do it and make it even though you &apos;re either careful or even paralyzed and having an experience of <unk> , until you get the moment you &apos;re going to <unk> us .
I got here . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years of college , a few years , a few years , you know , in <unk> , <unk> , I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m not at Harvard , I don &apos;t think I was not yet yet to be there .
At the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t take on the class around the semester , which is the <unk> , you know , you have to participate in the class , came to my <unk> . I didn &apos;t know the time before .
So let me say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be here . &quot; &quot; So I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not here . &quot;
That was my moment .
Because we &apos;ve got two things .
The first one I realized : <unk> ! I don &apos;t feel like this .
I didn &apos;t know me , but she and I would go back to his place .
The second was , of course , is there !
We &apos;re going to take it and can do it .
So I said , &quot; &quot; Yes , of course . &quot; &quot; Yes . Yes .
You &apos;ll go out to <unk> , you go <unk> , and you know what ... ( Applause ) You &apos;ll go to the class and you &apos;re going to give the best speech . &quot; &quot; And you know ? He did the best talk of everybody , people who are told me , he didn &apos;t know , he didn &apos;t know , he didn &apos;t know it , but I don &apos;t even know it , but I don &apos;t even know it , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a little
So we &apos;ve got to <unk> .
Now I want to tell you there are no way to do it until we &apos;re going to do it .
There &apos;s a lot of them going to be able to be able to be .
There &apos;s a lot of it that to do enough and <unk> .
The last one I &apos;m going to say is this .
We &apos;re going to change the big <unk> .
I &apos;m just two minutes .
Before I was asked to tell you that I would take you up for two minutes , you would have to <unk> this , in the <unk> , in the middle of the <unk> , in the <unk> with the door closed .
This is what you have to do .
We put the brain to get the best of that situation .
They would get testosterone . They &apos;ll <unk> the <unk> .
It didn &apos;t have that situation of your immune situation as I don &apos;t have a who I showed you who are .
I was showing that I was a feeling I &apos;m going to say who are and I &apos;ve shown you who are and I &apos;ve shown to me .
I want to leave it before I was nothing to take a position of power , and I also want to share my experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depend on this . ( Laughter ) We <unk> , we &apos;re going to ask people , because the best can use it to use these resources and it &apos;s not a position and it &apos;s not power .
They were just because they can do it in private .
We just need their body , privacy , privacy and two minutes to change the <unk> of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is the most big problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; <unk> â€” probably that it &apos;s a good choice .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to talk about what are the big problems of the world ?
And I should say , before I keep going on , I &apos;ll take you to each one of you who would have <unk> and paper because I &apos;m going to ask me to see how we do it .
So we had <unk> and paper .
And finally , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world of the world that &apos;s outside .
I &apos;m going to take you just some .
800 million people spend their own .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to water <unk> .
Two billion of no sanitation .
We &apos;ve been several million people die of HIV and AIDS .
The lists of <unk> .
Two billion people that were really pleased to be treated by the climate <unk> â€” and we <unk> it .
We have many other problems there .
In a ideal world , the <unk> all , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all problems .
And if we don &apos;t do it , the question I think we should do â€” and that &apos;s why the reason why we are in the economy of the economy â€” it &apos;s saying , if we don &apos;t do it , we really have to begin to ask ourselves , that problems should solve first ?
That &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to <unk> .
If you would say , 50 billion of <unk> are to spend the next four years to make the next four years to improve this world , what would we spend ?
It &apos;s going to take 10 of the most big challenges in the world , and just <unk> it , and we <unk> climate , <unk> , education , education , <unk> , education , <unk> , <unk> movements and <unk> , and they go and walls for trade .
We think these , in many ways , will take the greatest problems in the world .
What &apos;s about the question would be <unk> , what do you think are the greatest ones ?
Why should we start to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad problem about a bad
In fact , that was the <unk> of what was talked about in the <unk> .
But it &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s a problem if you &apos;re going to get people who are going to get us into problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
We &apos;ve certainly evolved the world &apos;s greatest problems we have in the world .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have ?
So the thing is not going to make it to the problems , but we &apos;re getting the solutions to problems .
And he had â€” naturally â€” naturally it &apos;s a little bit more complicated .
To <unk> , it would be something like <unk> .
To create a <unk> disease , they could be clinics or networks to mosquitos .
To the <unk> , they would be the court of peace in the United Nations , and so we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to tell you about that , and I &apos;m in 30 seconds â€” and I know that I kind of looks like something impossible â€” let &apos;s ask what you think are the <unk> priorities .
And also â€” in this case , there &apos;s a lot of , naturally , where the economy becomes <unk> â€” we would not be able to do it first .
What should it be to be at the end of the list ?
Please , I &apos;m going to go , just 30 seconds , maybe we &apos;re getting it with people , and just imagine what should they should be the main priorities and the least <unk> of the solutions that we have to do for the greatest problems of the world .
The surprising of this process â€” of course , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m just 18 minutes I mean â€” I &apos;m just 18 minutes of an important amount of time , right ?
I &apos;d like to say <unk> , and you &apos;re thinking about this process , and that &apos;s what we actually did .
And also the <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m sure we will also have these <unk> and think about how it really did it really ?
So since , there &apos;s a really question , so you would never have a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
Nobody wants to do .
Of course , all the organizations would be on the tallest of a list like that .
But also all the <unk> <unk> not being on the tallest .
And there &apos;s no longer , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t have any <unk> numbers , but you don &apos;t want to want a list like this .
So 60 years ago that there is a U.N. , and it &apos;s still not actually a basic list of the big things that we can do in the world , and said , what we should do is we should do first ?
This doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t think we &apos;re not going to <unk> â€” each decision is a <unk> , so that it &apos;s just a <unk> , so that &apos;s not just <unk> â€” and that &apos;s not surprising , and that &apos;s not aware that it &apos;s so good as if we actually did it , and it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> that .
So what I &apos;m emoting to is really saying that we had , for a long period of time , a situation in which there are extraordinary options .
There are many , many things we can do there , but we didn &apos;t have the prices , and we didn &apos;t have the prices , and it &apos;s not the same .
We had no idea .
Imagine you that I would walk into a restaurant and you have a huge letter , but you don &apos;t know what the prices are .
You know you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a <unk> , they could be 1,000 dollars .
Could be a familiar pizza . It could be a individual pizza , right ?
I &apos;m going to know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do the <unk> <unk> â€” it &apos;s about to put the prices of these subjects .
And so basically , this was the process of <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s 30 to the best economists in the world , three of each area .
So in order to take three of the best economists in the planet &apos;s <unk> about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be your cost ? What do you do ?
The same thing with <unk> disease .
Three of the best experts said , what can we do ?
What is the price ?
What we should do about that , and what would it be ?
And so on the front .
So we took some of the best economists in the world , eight of the best economists in the world , including three <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the May of 2004 .
The &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; â€” ( <unk> of <unk> decided to <unk> the Real <unk> of the economy .
<unk> works very well in Europe , but here &apos;s not so much .
And basically what they did , it was actually a <unk> list .
And then you <unk> , why should you ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy to me that question â€” ( Laughter ) â€” because it &apos;s a very good question .
The topic is , obviously , if you want to know malaria , ask questions about malaria .
If you want to know about the climate , ask questions about it .
But if you want to know what the two must solve is we can &apos;t solve any of the two , because that &apos;s what they do .
That &apos;s what they do .
<unk> .
They &apos;re going to be that <unk> , which we have to do first , and we have to do first , and we have to do it after .
So this is the list , and this is the list of <unk> to share with you .
Of course , you can see on the Web , and I &apos;m sure we also <unk> this as a <unk> .
Basically I said there was a list in which I said there was bad projects â€” basically , this , we &apos;re going to take a <unk> , and you have less than a result as a result .
Then they were the right projects , good and <unk> .
And of course , it &apos;s very good projects that we should be able to start to do .
I &apos;m going to start from the last way that we were going to end up with the best projects .
This was the bad .
As you can see the end of the list is the climate <unk> .
This offends the lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things about the things that people will say we should not be <unk> .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why did it ?
And the truth , I &apos;m also going to talk about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we don &apos;t have to agree with the lists of the <unk> .
The reason he worked with that is that it &apos;s been <unk> â€” or to do something more that we would have â€” it &apos;s not a good business just because it &apos;s too inefficient .
It &apos;s not saying that there is no global warming .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying what we can do for that is very little , at a very high cost .
What we basically show tells us , the media models are <unk> and <unk> , if all the world went out of , they &apos;ve been projected to 150 billion <unk> year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Two or three times the global help in development that we &apos;ve had to take the Third World every year .
And to do very little good .
All models show you that they were going to be <unk> about six years old .
So a guy in Bangladesh that makes a <unk> in the <unk> can expect to <unk> .
What &apos;s something like , but not very well .
So the idea and say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something else .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that the world estimates that the half of that amount , a <unk> billion dollars a year , we could solve all the basic problems of the world .
We could give water water , sanitation , sanitation , basic education and education all of the planet on the planet .
So we would have <unk> , we want to spend twice as much right ?
Or , half doing something wrong ?
And that &apos;s where it turns out , it turns out that it &apos;s wrong .
It &apos;s not saying that you would have to take the whole money of the world , you don &apos;t want to do it .
<unk> , which when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just not our first priority .
The hell goes out â€” I &apos;m not going to comment on all â€” but there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , but there &apos;s a lot of basic services in the world â€” sound like a bit , just because , it &apos;s a very big thing .
It was very well , but it also and very , very , very <unk> .
Again , what &apos;s told us , and suddenly we started thinking about the two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , it &apos;s a lot of sanitation projects .
Again , sanitation and water is important , but it &apos;s also important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you the four <unk> priorities that should be , when fewer , the first one that we think when we talk about how we should solve the problems of the world .
The tallest room is malaria â€” treating malaria .
<unk> malaria is about a couple of millions of people that we have every year .
It could even be a <unk> point of GDP as a year for the year to be affected .
If we <unk> a billion dollars in the next four years , we could reduce the <unk> to half .
We could prevent death from 500,000 people , but what &apos;s more important , we could prevent a billion people to be <unk> every year .
It <unk> his ability to treat many of the other problems that have to deal with , of course , in the long run , also the <unk> with global warming .
The third one is the free trade .
Basically , the model showed that you could get the free trade , and especially the <unk> of the project and Europe , we could basically rise the global economy until the <unk> number of two , two on the year of <unk> trillion <unk> year to the year , half of the Third World War II year , half of the Third World War II year , half of the Third World War II year by the year , half of the Third World War II year by the year , half of the Third World War II
Again , we could actually take a 200 or 200 or 300 billion people of poverty , radically and very fast , between two and five years .
That would be the third one one thing we could do .
The second one is going to be <unk> in the <unk> .
We don &apos;t have a general way , and we &apos;re not a very economical way of treating it , it &apos;s saying , the lack of <unk> .
Basically , half the population &apos;s population has no iron , <unk> , <unk> , vitamin D and vitamin D , the worldwide population , the world &apos;s population &apos;s creation .
If you take 12 billion dollars , we could make a deep <unk> in this problem .
This would be the second best one we could do .
And the best project would be <unk> in HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we &apos;ve invested 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could prevent 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Another time , what this makes and what is the thing is , you have two different ways as to treat AIDS AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is the <unk> .
Again , a ideal world , we would do two .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should be able to see where we should invest first .
And the treatment is much , much more expensive than <unk> .
So we &apos;ve been asking , what is the thing is , you can do much more investing in the <unk> .
Basically for the amount of money we can make out of the brain in treatment , and 10 times more in <unk> .
So once we have to continued to <unk> more than a treatment in treatment , as the first option .
What this makes us really do is that it really makes us think of our priorities .
I &apos;d like to say that I would take your list of <unk> and say , the <unk> ?
Would you ask something like what we did here ?
Well , it turns out , one of the things is again to <unk> climate change .
We &apos;re going to take a lot of people who think it &apos;s very , but we really probably don &apos;t know that .
We also could change climate change , if there &apos;s no other reason , just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t set all the <unk> .
We have many problems in the world .
And what I want to tell you is that if we focus on the problems , we &apos;re getting the more wrong .
These that we can do much more than little good .
And I think it &apos;s true â€” Thomas <unk> , one of the subjects of the <unk> <unk> , which explained it very , very well .
One of the things that people would have , and in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of climate change , people are going to be much more rich .
Even the most poignant impacts of the U.N. Foundation was even more <unk> by the U.N. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We &apos;ve shown that a media person in the developing world will be so rich as we are today .
And much more likely , the way , are the rich ones that we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even more rich than that .
But the thing is , that when we talk about saving people , the help people in Bangladesh in <unk> , we &apos;re not talking about a poor <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about a very rich <unk> .
And so the real topic of the case , of course , we want to spend a lot of money helping a little bit of it , and here &apos;s 100 years of a rich fit ?
Or or we want to help people , or we want to help people , and we want to help people , and who can help them be <unk> ?
Or as the man said , imagine that rich <unk> â€” as it will happen â€” a rich <unk> , a rich <unk> in the <unk> thinking in 2005 thinking , &quot; &quot; How do we get so much for a little bit of this topic of climate <unk> , and if we were so little by helping my grandmother to talk a little bit of the space of climate change , and if we were so little by helping my grandmother , and you would pay it much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think what really tells
Even if you don &apos;t agree with a typical view of this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s fundamentally because climate change has a very good photos .
You know we have &quot; &quot; El <unk> â€” &quot; &quot; â€” it seems cool , right ?
It &apos;s a good movie in the sense that I want to look at , right , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a lot of it , the <unk> <unk> in his next movie <unk> <unk> in Tanzania or something like this . ( <unk> ) It &apos;s just a good movie .
So in many ways , I think the <unk> <unk> and all the discussion about the Internet is an defense of the game of a velociraptor .
To make sure it &apos;s not just to feel good , it &apos;s really good enough to feel good , and to make it well , it &apos;s just to make it good , and to make it a lot , to make it well .
It &apos;s not going to do things that have the largest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to make things that have the largest <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s also going to make a bigger good .
The other objections , I think , that &apos;s important , is that there &apos;s some <unk> , or we &apos;re â€” you &apos;re â€” you &apos;re going to get a fake choice .
We have to do it all , in a ideal world â€” it &apos;s totally entirely according to .
I think we should do all of the things , but we don &apos;t do it .
In 1970 , the developed world decided we went to spend twice as we &apos;ve done , right now , that in 1970 in the developing world .
As our help rise to half .
It doesn &apos;t seem to be in the way of solving all the big problems .
So the same way , people would also say , but there are the war of Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100,000 billion <unk> . So we don &apos;t spend that good in the world .
I &apos;m going to go to me .
If you can talk to the Bush to make it , it &apos;s okay .
But the thing is still , it &apos;s still saying , if we were to <unk> another 100 billion dollars , it &apos;s still possible to make it better possible , right ?
So the real problem , is to start again and think what &apos;s the right priorities .
It should mention briefly , is this really the right list ?
You know , when you ask the best economists in the world , you will take you up to <unk> men and old the United States and old states of the United States and old America .
And they &apos;re not necessarily necessarily a great way to look at the whole world .
So we &apos;ve taken the 80 <unk> of all the world to get the same problem .
The only two requirements were that they were studying in college , and that English <unk> .
Most of them were , first in developing development .
They had the same material , but they could take away from the topic of the discussion of discussion , how really they did , to <unk> their own lists .
And the surprising was that the list was very similar â€” with <unk> and disease in the tallest and <unk> climate change .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There were many other <unk> and students college and different things .
They all had as a result , and they all had the same list .
And that &apos;s me really me , so I think , to say that I think there &apos;s a way to think about it to start thinking about our priorities , and say , what is the most important thing in the world ?
Of course , in a ideal world , we would have to do it all .
But if we don &apos;t do all , we can start to think about where we were going to do ?
I see the <unk> <unk> as a process .
So we did in 2004 , and we hope we would have a lot more people , to get better information information in 2008 , 2012 .
It was going to take the way right to the world , but also to start thinking about political <unk> .
To start thinking , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t make things what we can win as a little high cost , and it &apos;s not a lot of things we don &apos;t know how to do , but we make some great things where we can do a huge well , the low cost , right now . Right now , you can actually be honest with the discussion of how we can actually <unk> , but we have to be honest and <unk> to say , if there &apos;s a lot of things that we do , we
If we care a lot about some things , it &apos;s just more likely to worry about other things .
So I hope this is going to be the best to establish the better priorities of the priorities , and think how we worked better for the world .

A few years ago , I was beside her home in the house .
He had had a house in my house , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go home and I &apos;m going to see a friend on the other side of the city , and he was going to visit a friend on the other side of the city , and he was very cold .
And I was in the <unk> , looking for us to the pocket and <unk> it that I didn &apos;t have the keys .
In fact , they could see them down the window down the road up the room , where the <unk> .
But they were all scratched .
I couldn &apos;t <unk> me at home from my friend because I soon had a flight underneath Europe and he had to take his passport and he &apos;d have to take his passport and get him to him .
So desperate and desperate <unk> , I think , and I think , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of time , and I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the window to <unk> .
It has been used many money but not more than a <unk> in the middle of the night .
Well , we &apos;ve been able to take a neuroscience for neuroscience and analyze it , and we &apos;ve got to take a very good understanding of neuroscience , right to neuroscience .
<unk> <unk> , which elevates the heart rate was defined by the patient &apos;s heart rate , which elevates the heart rate of the adrenaline of adrenalin .
So the next morning when I came up after a little bit , worried about the window , I was going to talk about the window , and I was thinking about the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> that was going to have in Europe , had the mind <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> that was going to have a <unk> and a <unk> , and the <unk> who was going to have in Europe , had the mind <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> that was going
And until I was to the airport <unk> I didn &apos;t notice that I was going to read his passport .
So I came back quickly at home , and with the ice , in 40 minutes I came up to a handbag , I came back to the airport and I got a long time , but I would have to take my seat to another person who &apos;s another person .
Or , in the case of that <unk> things , the bad things are , in the case of the case , the case of the bad things , or in the case of that <unk> things , or in the case of that <unk> things , or in the case of that <unk> things , or in the case of that <unk> things , or in the case of that <unk> things , or in the case of that <unk> things , in the case of the case , the <unk> things , in the case of the
So Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me , and Danny told me
It was something that &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; Gary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who <unk> about this was a few years ago , and he also called <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a team of experts who try to determine what happened , not ?
Because in the <unk> <unk> , as he explained , I think , is that the way that we are doing , and then try to determine what you can do , and you try to determine what you can do , and you try to determine what you can do , and you try to determine what you can do , and you try to determine what you can do , and you try to determine what you can do , and you try to determine what you can do , and you try to determine what you
What I want to talk about today is what we can do today is what we can do today is we can do what we can do today .
Some things are responsible , other not so much .
I &apos;m going to start for the MIT .
They took places around the house for the things that lost them easily .
Well , this sounds of common sense , and it &apos;s so much like this .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain structure , called the hippocampus , to have hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of important things . Where is the <unk> , where you can catch the air , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
The hippocampus is part of the brain is part of the brain brain brain is the part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain is the brain part of the brain is the part of the brain .
In fact , there was some of them who did the experiment of <unk> sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But it works well with things that don &apos;t have to be too much and not with things that we have to do with .
So there &apos;s so many place you &apos;ll take your keys to the keys .
To pay a lot of a specific <unk> . The learning , a specific table .
If you take a place and you &apos;re going to get things to be in your place when you get it .
And when you get it ? You &apos;ll get a picture with your cell phone to your cell , and when you get it ?
It &apos;s going to give you an email to the photo to get the cloud .
These seem really obvious things .
Remember that when we &apos;re under stress , the brain emits <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> the mind .
We have to recognize that low stress don &apos;t go to the best of you and that should establish a better way .
I think when you get a doctor , you think when you get a doctor &apos;s decision .
We all are in a moment in a situation in a situation in a situation where we all have in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a situation in a
And I want to talk about .
Whether any decision that we need to do is something that we need to do to do or any decision that we need to do to do something that we need to do to do or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to do , or any decision that we need to do to
This is what you &apos;re going to call the doctor and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the test and have you hold a little bit . &quot;
You know that the cholesterol cholesterol came out to the emergency cholesterol .
And I think it &apos;s thinking that having the high cholesterol is not very good .
I would ask to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic to ask a statistic about a statistic to ask a statistic
It &apos;s the number necessary to play . ( <unk> ) And what is the <unk> ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to make a drug that would have to make a drug , but it &apos;s not just a person .
And we <unk> , what &apos;s the future of statistics is that ?
The number should be a . My physician doesn &apos;t tell me something that don &apos;t know .
But medicine doesn &apos;t work .
We don &apos;t know the <unk> mechanisms .
We &apos;ve shown that the 90 percent of the drugs work in between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cases .
So the <unk> in the case of the most <unk> <unk> that you think is ?
How many people have to be asked before to help someone ?
This second is the results of results , and this second is the second results , and this second is the second results , and this second is the second results , and this second is the second results , and this second is the second results , and this second is the second of results , and this second is the second of results , and this second is the second of results , and this second is the second of results , and this second is the second of results , and this second is the second
I really <unk> the data .
And I would argue , and we would have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we would have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In this medicine , the drug of this drug drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that drug is in the case of this drug that
And include things like <unk> . <unk> <unk> in the muscles and <unk> , <unk> <unk> â€” But <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . I don &apos;t think I don &apos;t .
You have 15 times more powerful than the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have <unk> <unk> of the drug you would have to have the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have to do that the drug you would have
I &apos;m not saying if I was <unk> <unk> or not not , but not not by the <unk> <unk> or not not by saying , &quot; I &apos;m not saying if I would have <unk> <unk> or not not by the <unk> <unk> or not not by saying it &apos;s <unk> <unk> or not not by saying it &apos;s <unk> <unk> or not not by saying it &apos;s <unk> <unk> or not not by saying it &apos;s <unk> <unk> or not not by saying it &apos;s <unk> <unk> or not not by saying it &apos;s <unk> <unk> or
I just had to have this conversation with just a doctor , but just that he was just having this conversation with your doctor .
You have to have access to this information to be able to talk to you to talk to this information to be able to talk to you to talk to this information to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk to this information to be able to talk to to talk to this information to be able to talk to this information
I mean this number to <unk> , I think of this number of <unk> to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , I think I &apos;m talking about this number to <unk> but actually the <unk> <unk> I &apos;m talking about this number of <unk> to <unk> but actually <unk> <unk> , I think I &apos;m talking about this number of <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> I &apos;m talking about this number of <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> I &apos;m talking about this number of <unk> , but actually the <unk> <unk> I &apos;m talking about
<unk> prostate cancer , <unk> prostate cancer , <unk> , is 49 .
Yes , you have to reach 49 to every person who help .
And the side effects in this case is <unk> in 50 percent of patients .
<unk> hurts , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> fecal <unk> .
So the idea of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is that the conversation is going to come out of the world , and that the conversation is going to come out and then the conversation out of the <unk> , so the conversation is going to be a very good way for that conversation .
The ideal is not having to create all this right time .
There &apos;s also to think of subjects like the quality of life .
I &apos;m a thing where we have to think now and get them to the family and being loved .
Remember , the same stress emits <unk> and one of the things that happen at that moment is that you &apos;ve had a lot of systems .
Evolution used to help .
Because the body would have a metabolism because if the body would have metabolism in these things , you don &apos;t have to find a very rapidly , because if your body would get printed , you don &apos;t really understand it , because if your body would get printed , you don &apos;t really understand it , because if your body would get printed , you don &apos;t really understand it , because if your body would get printed , you don &apos;t really understand it , because if your body would get printed , you don &apos;t
<unk> , one of the things that are expected to be used to the same as a result of the world , as a lawyer , is the same as a lawyer , as a representative , as a representative of the <unk> , as a representative of the <unk> , as a representative of the <unk> , as a <unk> , is a lot of things like the <unk> of the <unk> , which has been shown in the world as a <unk> , and the other thing .
So we need to <unk> to think about this kind of <unk> .
I think the most important thing is to recognize that we all have <unk> .
You &apos;ll see you &apos;re going to <unk> .
The idea is to think of <unk> in what they can be these <unk> , the systems that can minimize the damage or just to prevent these things <unk> .
He asked that night with snow in the wire , and when I came back from the journey , I was going to run out of the <unk> and the key code of the house inside and a easy code of going to remember .
They are not fully organized to organized organized .
Good day !
Are they going to <unk> ?
Anybody ? No . Well , nothing .

At that moment , I started thinking .
And it was very much .
How do we get here ?

It &apos;s going to be his next .
Because if we take any <unk> product plant , we know that it &apos;s not a place .
Nobody would be surprised that it was a place .

How do we get it ?
If you don &apos;t see any problem , it &apos;s better to stop and stop talking on .
What I mean is that those guys had a specific disinfectant .
I have a friend who speaks to me that he &apos;s got a <unk> .
I had a while I asked her .
And he said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I had a whole night trying to figure out how many of the entire life trying to figure out how to <unk> <unk> <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; All right , but I had time I had to <unk> it . &quot;
It was not who she &apos;s not saying that his husband &apos;s not to her husband , and it &apos;s normal to me , and it &apos;s normal he doesn &apos;t understand it ; his husband &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s normal he doesn &apos;t understand it ; his way it &apos;s different .
She told me , &quot; &quot; El <unk> <unk> me , and a night , I would love to me to feel what I feel when I was when I was saying I &apos;m when I was saying I &apos;m when I was saying I was when I was watching the <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> <unk> this : &quot; &quot; ... <unk> my hands and <unk> ... &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the fuss : &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m going to hear you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s
( Applause ) Well , what we did is , and we did to protect the Arab language ?
They will take place to the civilian society , and they would allow them to embrace the civilian society , to bring them into civil society , allowing us to embrace civil society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society , to embrace a civilian society
Even if a lot of people said , &quot; &quot; Why do you get you ?
We wrote this little bit and <unk> it . &quot; &quot; So , &quot; &quot; Is this problem , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a problem ? &quot; &quot; So , I wrote this piece and <unk> .
In the campaign to preserve Arabic the next one , one was the following <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next <unk> : <unk> the next
We don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Is no ! Is it not to be <unk> , and it &apos;s this . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have that style because of that way we don &apos;t get to <unk> .
And when somebody speaks this way , they hate the Arab .
<unk> â€” ( Applause ) I think we want to change our reality , and be convinced of a way that it is going to reflect our dreams , aspirations and day .
It turns out that view as we think about it as we think .
After that &apos;s a little girl &apos;s photos like <unk> and girls like Arabic characters .
They were told them to young people , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in English .
We &apos;re very <unk> .
And whatever you say , &quot; &quot; Hey , you &apos;ll ask a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I &apos;ll tell you what we would have , but it &apos;s going to be a more beautiful word and it really understood it &apos;s a more beautiful word and it &apos;s really successful it really better with reality .
I &apos;m going to follow the Internet .
Or , or what they think they have to have authority about us , or what they think they have authority about us , where they are in the world &apos;s <unk> , or what they think they have authority about us , where they &apos;re going to be there , where they &apos;re going to be there , where they &apos;re going to make the language of us , where they &apos;re going to be there , where they &apos;re going to be there , where they &apos;re going to be there , where they &apos;re going to
The creativity in the mother is the way .
So let &apos;s start with now .
One one is a novel , a novel , a new one .
It could take the Arab one again .
But we have to know that , and that &apos;s convinced that there &apos;s a solution , and we have the <unk> of it .
So , next , you can do you from now right now ?
Let &apos;s see â€” <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> ?
Please , I would argue , even my time , I &apos;ve been able to <unk> it , and I would like my time , I would have to <unk> it , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time , I was still <unk> , but my time ,
But I don &apos;t write Arabic in Arabic to <unk> <unk> with numbers .
( Applause ) So this is a <unk> ! Is it not a language !
They would give me to me in a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to go back to that world and <unk> .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
The babies would have started to first their father &apos;s father first to his father &apos;s father first to his father , and babies would have the first one to his father .
So when I was reading my daughter , I said , &quot; &quot; This is a little , mine . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; &quot; This is <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
What &apos;s happening in the mind of a baby ?
If we were to take this 30 years , most people , psychologists , would say this baby is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> â€” that wouldn &apos;t be in account of the perspective of other person or not to make a process of <unk> .
Over the last 20 years , the science of development has been completely this theory .
In a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of scientists more <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to give you an example of this .
One thing that could be thinking this baby , which could be happening in his mind , is to try to figure out what &apos;s happening in the mind of a baby &apos;s mind .
So finally , one of the most difficult things , one of the most difficult things is to try to get to the other people who are people think and feel .
And perhaps the hardest thing is to understand that what others think and feel it is not the same as what we think and we feel .
Anyone who &apos;s in the so much of the political may say the difficult thing is , it &apos;s a few people .
We wanted to know if babies and children are small , and kids small , understand this very complex idea about other people .
So , the thing is , how can we <unk> ?
The babies don &apos;t talk , and if we ask a three-year-old child that tells us what thinks , only we will only make a sense of thinking about <unk> , <unk> and things for style .
How can we then get it ?
It turns out that the secret was the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , one of my students , and more I gave me to the babies two dishes with food , a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> .
The babies , even in Berkeley , I &apos;m like a lot of the <unk> and I don &apos;t want to like the stupid .
( Laughter ) So what was he made was , I was able to test food from two dishes .
And he &apos;s been calling or not what I would love .
Half of the time , I would like to <unk> the <unk> and don &apos;t eat it â€” as any baby or normal person .
But the other half , we would have a little bit of <unk> and say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , you eat .
You &apos;ll see the stupid . <unk> . &quot; &quot; And then we found a <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
They were <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s saying , it &apos;s like you would love the opposite of what they love to babies .
We did this with babies and 18 months .
So I would ask you to ask her hand and say , &quot; Would you get a little bit ? &quot;
What &apos;s a question was : <unk> babies what they loved to them or their ?
The surprising was that babies baby babies were coming from 18 months , and I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> if you were <unk> <unk> and the <unk> you can see the ball .
On the other hand , babies and babies are going to be able to sit 15 months to it if they were to not allowed to get it , as if you can &apos;t understand .
And after it &apos;s going to take a long mouse , I would <unk> it , and what thought I &apos;d like to love the world .
So there &apos;s two data of this . So there &apos;s two data on this .
So one side is that babies &apos; babies are already given up the important world of human nature : we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , they understood that they have to act to help other people to get what they would have .
And most interesting , but the babies &apos; <unk> is not doing this ; what suggests that children from 18 months they learned this deep to be human in three months that the <unk> of the baby &apos;s 15 months ago .
So babies know , babies know more and teach us more than we &apos;ve ever been able to do now .
And this is just one of the hundreds of studies that have been made in the last 20 years , this fact .
What if you can ask now now is : Why do kids teach so much ?
And how do we teach so much of that way , so little time ?
I mean , the first view , babies seem quite a lot of a lot .
And in many times sometimes , they are worse , because we have to use a lot of time and energy just in living living in living living .
If you &apos;re going to <unk> it , to look at the mystery of this mystery by which we lost so much time looking out babies , it turns out there &apos;s a response to a <unk> response , it turns out there &apos;s a response to look so quickly , looking out that you have a response to look so quickly , looking out that you have a response to look so quickly , looking out that you have a response to look so quickly , looking out that you have a response to look so quickly ,
If we look in various species , not only other <unk> like us , but it also also other <unk> , birds , even other <unk> , they even <unk> as the <unk> or the <unk> , it turns out that there are relationship between the <unk> of childhood , and the size of the brain and the species of the species .
One example of this <unk> of these birds that you can see here .
So a band of <unk> has the crow &apos;s crow .
<unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are birds very .
In the right senses are so smart as the <unk> .
And this is a very , very , very , very , very , very early , has learned how to get food .
On the other hand , we have to our income as a domestic .
<unk> , like the ducks , <unk> and geese , they &apos;re <unk> like stones .
They &apos;re very good at all , but they &apos;re very good at doing anything else .
It turns out that babies from the <unk> of New York City , the <unk> , the babies , the babies from the <unk> of New York , the <unk> , the babies from the <unk> of New York , the babies , the babies from the <unk> of New York , the babies , the babies from the <unk> of New York , the babies , the babies from the <unk> of New York , the babies , the babies from the <unk> of New York , the babies , the babies from the <unk> of New York
We rely on the methods that their mothers would have to make them realize that their mothers would have to take the worms in the mouth until the two years of life , which is a very long time in short life in a bird .
But the chickens are a adult life in just a couple of months .
So next childhood is the reason that the <unk> do in the <unk> of scientific papers as well as the chickens do in the pot of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the
There &apos;s something in the long time that it seems to be related to knowledge and knowledge .
What should we have to do this ?
Some animals , like chickens , seem to be <unk> to do a very good thing .
So chickens are very good at a very good environment in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like <unk> , are not particularly good doing anything particular , but they &apos;re very good learning about the norms of different environments .
And of course , we , we are , we are both far away in that distribution .
We have the greatest brains of our bodies , much more than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , more <unk> , more <unk> , we can survive more , much more environments , and we have <unk> around the planet and even face space .
And our babies and children are all around us over a lot more time that babies babies are .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So minus the 23 , we still have the <unk> in their mouths in their open mouths in their open mouths . ( Laughter ) So minus the 23 , we still have to <unk> these <unk> in their open mouths . ( Laughter ) So minus the 23 , we still have to <unk> these <unk> in their open mouths . ( Laughter ) So minus the 23 , we still have to <unk> these <unk> in their open mouths . ( Laughter ) So minus the 23 , we still have to <unk> these
All right , why do we look at this close data ?
One idea is that that strategy , the strategy of learning , is a very powerful way of <unk> and strong <unk> in this world . But it &apos;s a big <unk> : a very powerful way .
It turns out that until you learn everything , if you &apos;re <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t going to be good if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it and think , &quot; Would you get a <unk> or a <unk> ? What will it better ? &quot;
It would be better knowing that before we were <unk> <unk> .
And the way that evolution was <unk> this problem was , it seems to be a <unk> of the work .
So we have this period of time where we &apos;re fully scratched .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . We just learn .
And so , in adults , we can take that we learn from babies and children and put it into practice to <unk> around the world .
A way to think about this is that babies and children are small , like the department of the <unk> and <unk> of the human species .
They are people who go out to go , and they &apos;re only getting to go , learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re the production and <unk> .
We have to take all these ideas that learn from kids and <unk> in practice .
Another way of view is , instead of thinking of babies and kids as adults as adults , think of them as a different state of the different development of the same species ; like the <unk> and the <unk> , the babies would be the <unk> that we would have to <unk> by exploring the <unk> and we would <unk> the <unk> in our very narrow way of adults .
If this is a certain , if babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution shows us that it is , that kids are to learn that there are a lot of powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But the real thing that the real computers are getting too much .
It &apos;s probably a revolution in our way to understand the machines .
And all of this man &apos;s ideas , the <unk> Thomas <unk> , an statistical and rectangular mathematician in the 18th century .
Basically , we &apos;ve had to have mathematical capacity that we &apos;ve been looking at the theory of the probability to the museum and describe the way that scientists have been interested in the world .
What scientists do is we get a hypothesis , something that we could start .
So I would take that hypothesis with a test .
The evidence is going to change the hypothesis , and the test is going to change the hypothesis , the test , will make it change the way , and the test will be changing the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change the hypothesis , the hypothesis that makes change
They are going to get rid of the <unk> with new tests , and so we would <unk> it .
What we &apos;ve shown was that there was a mathematical <unk> that could do that .
And math is the basis of the best programs that we have today in the day .
Ten years ago , we would argue that babies were going to be doing the same .
If we want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , I think it &apos;s something really like a very similar <unk> , and if you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , if you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , if you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , if you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , if you want to know what &apos;s happening under these beautiful <unk> <unk> , if you
I found the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think babies are doing very complicated calculations with likely to be able to <unk> them and so they would <unk> how it works .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove .
If we ask an adult about statistics , we can feel pretty stupid .
How is it possible that kids do statistics ?
To test this , we used a machine that we &apos;ve created to call the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a box that lights up and sounds that it sounds like that &apos;s been written by some of these particular objects .
By using this simple machine , in my lab , and also in other , if we <unk> dozens of studies on the good ones are learning about the world learning about the world .
You just just just one that we &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> , one of my students .
If you &apos;re going to give you this detector probably probably just thinking that the way of <unk> is to put a <unk> on the detector .
But the case is that the detector work in a very strange way .
If you take a <unk> on the detector on the detector , something that we don &apos;t have to recreate a beginning , the detector are active , the detector are the most of three times .
We would argue that if we put the brakes on it , what would it be logical , only if it was the logical , only <unk> every six times .
So the chance you have to have more obvious test .
It seems to be that strategy of <unk> the object is more than another .
So we explain these data to the kids of four and a half years that the <unk> .
And with security , the children of four <unk> <unk> the data and <unk> the right object on the detector .
There are two main data in this fact .
The first one , <unk> that are a couple of years , and the first one , you know , you &apos;re a couple of days , and the first one , you know , you &apos;re a couple of days , and the first one , you know , you &apos;re a couple of days , and the first one , you know , you &apos;re a couple of days , and the first one , you know , you &apos;re a couple of days , and the first one , you know , you &apos;re a couple
They are learning to tell us , they &apos;re learning to tell us .
But it &apos;s also doing complex calculations that they offer a measure of <unk> <unk> .
The second thing is that they &apos;re using evidence to get a sense , a hypothesis about the world , which seems to something bit likely to start at principle .
In studies that do the lab in the lab , other similar other , we &apos;ve shown that these kids of four are better likely to be able to find a little bit more likely than adults , given the same task .
In these circumstances , kids are doing statistics to make things about the world , and the scientists that we experience , and we wanted to see if the kids were too .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re usually called &quot; &quot; walking around &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; It has been a lot of interesting studies lately that would argue that these games are like a scientific program program .
It &apos;s going to take one of the lab to <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to ask kids that the yellow <unk> will work and the red triangles doesn &apos;t , until I &apos;ve actually given a malfunction .
What will we see now is this boy <unk> a little chance in two minutes of time .
Child : And so that ?
Child : Just like the other side .
<unk> : Well , the first hypothesis we <unk> .
Child : Nothing . ( Laughter ) Child , but this doesn &apos;t .
<unk> : It starts to describe the <unk> .
( Video : Why did this be <unk> ?
( Laughter ) Child : Don &apos;t understand .
<unk> : The scientists will tell you to recognize that face of <unk> .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be so much , and this has to be like this .
<unk> : <unk> , chance two .
Child : So it &apos;s got .
Child : Oh ... can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) <unk> : Now , now it comes to this idea .
It &apos;s going to be the researcher that we had to put on it on the other .
Nor didn &apos;t work .
Child : Oh , it &apos;s because light will only go to here , not to see it .
In the case , there &apos;s electricity , but this doesn &apos;t have it .
<unk> : Well , that would be the fourth hypothesis .
Child : So yeah , if the lights go .
If you put four <unk> <unk> .
If you put four <unk> into this , you would have to <unk> and two to the one .
<unk> : Well , that &apos;s the farm .
This child is â€” it &apos;s a very <unk> child and <unk> , but <unk> found that it &apos;s a very typical kid .
If you look like a play , you &apos;re going to ask you to ask something , what do you do is , what do you do is to experience it .
Every typical children of 4 .
Well , what do you feel like this kind of creature ?
What if you feel like a <unk> that can be a little chance in two minutes ?
If we analyze the theory of psychologists and philosophers , many people say babies and children are just conscious , or even not the sound .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think babies and children are more conscious than the adults .
This is what we know about how to be an adult .
Consciousness and attention from a adult person a focus .
What happens in the adults is that when we decided something is important or relevant , it will be wrong .
So , that &apos;s what we can do with that we can become <unk> and intense , as the rest of the rest of them , as they belong .
We also know how this happens in the brain .
When we pay attention to something , the frontal part of the brain , the part of the brain , the part of the action , is a signal that makes a little part of the brain if you would have a little bit more <unk> to learn , and threaten the activity in the rest of the brain .
We have this way a very <unk> , right ? Right ?
If you look babies and kids , you see something very different .
I think babies and kids seem to have a meaningful awareness of a torch than a torch .
<unk> babies and children will have a lot of attention to attention to one thing .
But it &apos;s very well to have a lot of data in account of many sources .
And if we look at your brains , what we see is that they are <unk> to <unk> learning and plasticity , and that the <unk> has even never come to cable .
So when we say babies and kids are able to pay attention , what really means is it costs not to pay attention .
It &apos;s interesting , I think I would think of that , I think , I think , is just looking at what &apos;s important to do what matters .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the type of consciousness we have to wait for those <unk> that are going to learn .
If we want to think about a way to feel that kind of child , as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases where we &apos;re not never ; every time we &apos;re not never ; each time you &apos;re asking them , or when we go to a city for the first time .
<unk> cases , not if we &apos;re expanding , but it &apos;s expanding , so it seems to that in three days in Paris , more awareness and experiences that every few months around the house , walking up , going on , going on , going on , going on , just like <unk> .
So right , that coffee , that <unk> , that you take coffee , actually it &apos;s actually the effect of the <unk> of babies .
So how is it a baby ?
It &apos;s like being boyfriend , in Paris , for the first time , after the first three <unk> <unk> .

But it &apos;s really a adult .
I don &apos;t mean too much about the great ones that are babies .
It &apos;s okay .
We can do things like <unk> or crossing the road in the street .
And it has sense that we &apos;re going to take a lot of effort to do that babies think about the adults .
But if what we want is to be like those <unk> , having the mind open , to be open to learning , imagination , imagination , innovation , innovation , perhaps , at least sometimes , to sometimes be able to do a little bit like kids .

And in this case , it can recognize objects or at least the photos like I was permanent , and in this case , we can recognize objects or at least the photos of the time .
The picture is empathy and the familiarity of these <unk> objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , a forensic scientist , if you want , and the outcome is the most similar possible to a document .
When you were throwing the same way into <unk> bodies and these ordinary objects , when you were throwing the eyes in the same way , it would be <unk> bodies and these common objects , when they were throwing their eyes to the same <unk> bodies and these ordinary objects , when they were throwing their eyes to the same <unk> bodies and these ordinary objects , when they were throwing their eyes to the same <unk> bodies and these ordinary objects , when they were throwing their eyes to the same <unk> bodies and these ordinary objects

I &apos;m here to share my picture .
This is photograph ?
Because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take away from your cameras .
With all my interest in the picture started when I was walking my back camera at 15 years .
I was interested in my passion , by the print , it &apos;s a little different , because by using the camera was the way more well in the planning of the planning was the way in the planning was a lot more well in the planning .
And when a picture of a picture of a camera , the process finishes when you get <unk> .
To me the picture was more than seeing with being in the place in the <unk> moment .
I would argue that any of you could do .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process was to <unk> the <unk> .
It &apos;s like this : a building in a very <unk> road .
But it &apos;s an unexpected gyrus .
And yet , it &apos;s going to be a feast of realism .
Or photos like these â€” dark and colorful , but all the same time , but all with the common objective to keep the realism level .
When I say I say I &apos;ll say I &apos;ll be <unk> .
Because of course , it &apos;s not something that can actually be captured , but I always want to know it sounds captured in some way like a picture .
And I think it &apos;s going to be a probably going to think a moment to discover the magic .
So this has more than seeing a thought of capture a sense that we &apos;ve actually actually actually .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it sound ?
You have to see what details or the colors ?
Do you have to see the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
The point is the illusion .
But at the end of our way , we can play the world and how it can be <unk> in a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s really not about realistic if it &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
So I think the basics are very simple .
I was going to <unk> as a <unk> of reality that we take different pieces of reality and we put together a alternative reality .
Let me show you a simple example .
So here we have three physical objects perfectly <unk> , something that we all relate to live in a three-dimensional world .
But they &apos;re in a way that it &apos;s still a three-dimensional looks that it has still three-dimensional .
But at the same time , we know that there can &apos;t be there .
So we &apos;ve been able to do this brain because the brain is just not paying it to fact that it &apos;s really not meaning .
And I see the same process by combining pictures .
It &apos;s really really a lot of combining realities .
So the things that make a picture look like realistic sounds , I think are those people who don &apos;t even think it &apos;s in the things that we don &apos;t even think of it in our lives .
But when we combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to have in account this . Because of the contrary <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;d like to say there are three simple approaches that follow to get it to it .
As you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first <unk> is that the dollar photos have to have the same view .
Second , the car photos have to have the same kind of light .
And these two pictures would have been used with these requirements ; they have been <unk> at the same time and the same type of light .
The third point is to do with the exact third point where they start and do the different images of a perfect mess .
It has to be impossible to say how to <unk> the picture .
<unk> of the color , the contrast and the <unk> of the <unk> that there &apos;s between the different images , we gave them <unk> <unk> like depth depth , colors and noise , <unk> the limits between the different images and we do it , it &apos;s a single picture , despite fact that one sounds really clearly really can have hundreds of layers .
This is another example .
( Laughter ) It could be <unk> that this is the picture of a landscape and the lower is what it was manipulated .
But this picture is completely fully written by the different photos of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier to create a place that &apos;s easier to create a place that would be , because one doesn &apos;t need to commit the ideas that has in the head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in winter , I knew I had a few months for designing , to find different places for the <unk> bits of the <unk> .
For example , the fish was captured on a <unk> , fish .
The back of the age of a different .
The <unk> part was taken to a stone in a stone .
And yeah , even I &apos;ve done the house of the <unk> of the island for that he was more <unk> .
So to get a realistic result , I think we &apos;ll have a planning .
And I always became a <unk> , a sense .
So there &apos;s a lot of different pictures .
And here every piece of sound is very well .
If you make a good job to take the photos the results , it may be very beautiful and very realistic .
All tools are there , and the only thing that we &apos;re not , is our imagination .
Thank you .
