( Arabic ) <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
( <unk> ) <unk> in a family class .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but when I <unk> it , he was already a business man .
If their children were children or girls , they were children ; they &apos;re going to go to school .
So I suppose I was <unk> .
My mother was <unk> 16 times .
Of the 16 <unk> , we &apos;re alive five .
You can imagine why I had to spend when I was a kid .
<unk> , there were women being transported to <unk> , or children being brought to a <unk> .
At that moment , when I graduated , I &apos;m pleased to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I would argue my education , but I would go to college .
<unk> , in my country , there was no square for women in the <unk> , but even if I was in medical school , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father <unk> America .
I watched in America .
Given my studies .
Whereas I was interested in my education , Russia <unk> my country .
You know , when I was walking my training , I would argue what I was happening to my family and my country .
Twelve months , and I was not bad .
My family took a field of <unk> .
So instead I graduated from my family , I gave my family family .
I wanted you to get safe .
But where I was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I <unk> the news , when it was still the <unk> in my country , I <unk> the heart .
I was going to go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go out because there was no place to me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a university .
<unk> .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
They were living with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to leave my home .
So we went to the ballpark .
And when I arrived at the field of <unk> <unk> , there was seven million and a half of <unk> . Seven billion and a half .
<unk> , black &apos; 90s were women and children , and the majority of men or died in the war , and they know what ?
And when he was doing it , I was doing things that I don &apos;t care about .
I watched a widow with five and eight children , sitting there , <unk> , without knowing that to do .
I watched a new woman who didn &apos;t have to go , without research , or income , or a place where I live .
And I watched kids who have lost their parents , their <unk> , and on 10 or sweet , they had to take away their families , to be the head of family and try to protect their siblings , their moms and children .
The situation was absolutely <unk> .
My heart <unk> in my people and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
In that moment , it &apos;s a impulse .
In that moment , I felt like , what can I do for these people ?
How can I get <unk> ?
I &apos;m a single person , who can do for them ?
But at that point , I knew that education has been my life .
<unk> . It offers a position .
<unk> trust . It &apos;s a career .
You would take underground to my family , putting my family into another country , so they were safe .
And at the point I knew that what I was meant to provide to my people was education and health and that was what I was doing .
But they think it was easy ?
Because not , because of that , women didn &apos;t have access to education .
In addition , after <unk> in Afghanistan , people don &apos;t have no harm .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who are I ?
Anybody who comes from the United States .
Some of you who are here .
So I would ask me , of course ?
So what really needed was to win trust of this community .
How do I do it ?
I went to <unk> , I watched and watched .
I &apos;ve done questions .
So I found a man .
I had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
I went to his tent in the <unk> and <unk> the proposal , &quot; &quot; I want to take a teacher . &quot;
And I would argue , and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , crazy , how do I think I can be professor ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , I &apos;m going to make you a teacher .
In a year , we had a <unk> schools , 15,000 children go to school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So of course , we were doing our work , forming teachers . It &apos;s <unk> in women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy and laws , all sorts of <unk> . And one day , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to do our work , forming teachers .
One day I was in the office in <unk> , and one day I was in the head of <unk> , and one day I was in the office in <unk> , a day in <unk> , <unk> , a day , and a day , I was in the office in <unk> , and one day I was in office in <unk> , a day in <unk> , <unk> , a day , and a day in <unk> , I was in the office office in <unk> , and one day I was in the office in <unk>
And suddenly , I saw that my personal bear was walking the doors and <unk> the doors and <unk> the doors and <unk> , and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) <unk> , being the leader , who do it ?
You know . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is .
But as a leader , you have to maintain the <unk> .
You have to maintain the <unk> and show a fortress .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And these people would have come into mass my office .
So you &apos;re going to walk into the office .
<unk> . Three nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine ,
These were the most <unk> men who can see never .
( Laughter ) People with <unk> <unk> , black clothes , and put them in mass in my office .
And I would sit down and take a cup .
<unk> . Don &apos;t they go .
And of course , the pitch of voice that was very afraid , and I was really impaired .
But at the same time , it turns out it turns out .
And of course , at that point at the moment , you see as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a black armband .
The only thing I saw was the eyes .
<unk> : What do we do ?
Do you don &apos;t know that the school would have stopped the women ?
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And they know , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; and I wrote , &quot; &quot; What school ? â€” where &apos;s the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I &apos;m sorry to say , &quot; &quot; This is the house of somebody . &quot; &quot; I wrote , &quot; &quot; This is the house of somebody .
You see some students . We all teach the Koran , the holy book .
You know , the Koran tells you that if you get the holy book that women might be good wives , and they can obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to show you one thing : this is how it &apos;s about that people . ( Laughter ) At that moment , it &apos;s like this .
<unk> between them and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to <unk> me again . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I took me away .
So my personal <unk> in mass of my office office .
They were dead .
They didn &apos;t know what they didn &apos;t .
They didn &apos;t know how they didn &apos;t care about them .
With all of all the worm little worm .
Very happy and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) Of course , I was alive .
But also , by placing <unk> during the fall of <unk> , when the <unk> had the power was another story .
<unk> in the <unk> and <unk> 80 girls , 3 students were <unk> , and they had a <unk> .
I used to fall out of the <unk> , we went through the country and we open a school after another .
We opened up school centers .
<unk> clinics without .
We worked with women and children .
<unk> health care .
We &apos;ve seen how many kinds of designs you can imagine .
I was very happy . It was <unk> with the result of my work .
And one day , when I was going to spend four , and with a retrospective , I would creep up to the north of Kabul , suddenly a little bit more , <unk> on the middle of the road , they had 19 kids .
With it back back to the back , you &apos;ll get the road .
I would tell my driver of my driver and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s nothing you can see with you . &quot; &quot; <unk> my name and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> the song , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and <unk> .
At that moment , women would go into the car .
I &apos;m very happy and <unk> : &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
This time , I will kill everyone .
She had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes out , it &apos;s going to be the way you think and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You know in your <unk> , and you can follow that .
So I would sit on one side of the car .
My leg <unk> and went out of the car .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; &quot; You know what I did ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Come on every day of a place .
<unk> women , <unk> and also gives the chance to have a job .
( Laughter ) <unk> . What about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What about us ?
What we &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Well .
What we know , the only thing we can do is the time in the time we hear it , is to get a weapon and kill .
We don &apos;t know more .
Obviously it was a trap .
So I went and said , &quot; &quot; Get out and said &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I sat on the car , I sat down , and I said to the driver , and I said to the driver .
We just had money to <unk> them , to go to school , and nothing more .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s going to get your home . No .
My dorm was the only one I was there , and I <unk> without voice .
I was <unk> , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;ve got education for education .
Hundreds of women came to the <unk> .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly , now , we &apos;re here talking about pulses , because , at the moment , one of my wonderful , <unk> <unk> <unk> a report .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote him .
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you . What do you happen ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No .
It was equal to me , I didn &apos;t believe , and it was still asking me .
&quot; &quot; Okay , tell you that &apos;s happening . &quot;
<unk> all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for next to next , you go and get them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I &apos;ve done the same way , know the same way , know that ? They weren &apos;t there , they were a little further away , the same kids , there were a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s a little bit further , the same kids , you know , you know ?
So I stopped the car .
And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
So I took the mosque and to sum up , I had to <unk> teachers .
Now , they are the best educators .
<unk> English , learning how to be used , learning computer and are my <unk> .
All the areas we don &apos;t know in the mountain areas , they come to me . They go ahead and go .
And I <unk> .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s the education to change people .
When we <unk> the individuals , they change and we have to work with equality .
You can &apos;t educate women and <unk> men from men , because men are the people who were more difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started asking them , because they must be aware of the potential of women , to know how much of the women who have men and who are those women who are in .
So we form men continuously and I don &apos;t think deeply deeply deeply deeply .
I live in a country that live in a country that live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful , beautiful country .
It was all the parts .
Women <unk> education : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> â€” <unk> .
Don &apos;t <unk> the doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of the security problems .
But we still want Afghanistan before .
And I want to tell you about another part .
Now , women in Afghanistan work very hard .
<unk> . <unk> to be <unk> .
It was going to be <unk> , again .
They were going to be <unk> and paste .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people use all their potential and all this will happen .
I want to share with you for the love of love , by compassion and by honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;ll succeed .
We have a poet , <unk> <unk> .
He said , if you have compassion and if you have love , you can tell you the world .
And we <unk> , we were .
And if we were in Afghanistan , I &apos;m going to be safe by 100 percent that can happen in the world .
Thank you , so many , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So I was <unk> at UCLA , University of California in Los Angeles <unk> techniques .
<unk> was a <unk> of Los Angeles of Los Angeles .
One old <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that was a brain <unk> .
So if you could go to the zoo , you can go to the zoo to search for a possible cause to search for a possible cause .
So let me leave of clear that the United States of the United States , with <unk> <unk> <unk> and highly <unk> that care of their own animals .
But sometimes , I would argue to the medical community , especially for some <unk> training , especially for some <unk> training , especially in the community .
It <unk> <unk> the brain <unk> in the case of this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> by a very heart and a collaborative and a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of <unk> and doctors in a collaborative process of
And this procedure , that we &apos;ve made in many human patients , it was <unk> , with the exception of that <unk> and that glue .
<unk> symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients ; it &apos;s going to be a lot of people who are going to be able to understand their own animals .
And when I once was in the same day last year became the German Center in UCLA Medical Center .
And I started looking at one thing , and I started to see one thing .
The doctors and <unk> <unk> are basically the same diseases in their patients , basically , doctors and <unk> <unk> the same diseases for their human patients and animals , and the <unk> heart <unk> , <unk> cancer , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Well , I have to have a <unk> .
Even though I &apos;ve studied physiology compared to evolutionary biology and evolutionary biology during the university â€” I really did my Cambridge thesis on the <unk> of Darwin â€” learning more about the significant diseases between the animals and human illness was a very necessary to me .
And I started asking them how it could be , with all of these <unk> , who would never be able to hear about a <unk> or <unk> <unk> to have another view about one of my patients ?
Have you never seen a Talk wrong ?
Even more , why should we <unk> ?
Every doctors would have some social connections between animals and human beings .
All of the drugs that we prescribe , we take or we give our families <unk> before in a animal .
But there &apos;s a big difference between giving an animal a drug or a drug disease , and that animal has to take a human disease and that animal damage to themselves .
Maybe part of the surprise comes from the growing seasons that our world does between the <unk> and the <unk> .
We &apos;re going to talk about these kids who believe that the rising suns in the trees or the cheese comes from a plant .
The human hospitals in today are going to change more and more in <unk> departments .
And this creates a <unk> device between humans that are in there are treated and the animals that live in the oceans , in the <unk> and the jungles .
But I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : it &apos;s still more profound .
The doctors and scientists were threatened by that our species , Homo erectus , is only one more likely , and not even special than anything else .
But in our underwear we don &apos;t end up to <unk> .
I was asking myself when I was saying to Mozart or I see in my <unk> the photos that caused Mars .
I feel that called the human <unk> , even <unk> the cost scientifically <unk> of <unk> as a higher part .
Well , but this <unk> is <unk> .
Now , when I look at a human patient , I always ask : What are the doctors of the animals about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
And more : Could we take better to my human patient if you &apos;re going to get better to my human patient if you &apos;re asking them as a human animal ?
And here &apos;s some examples of the connections that tells me that they took me this kind of <unk> .
<unk> heart <unk> .
Forty by 2000 , the <unk> of humans , they found &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , to the <unk> of the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , to the <unk> of the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans that were found .
It was described to be described in a dad a game at the game that has lost the entire entire life of data , a <unk> <unk> .
But it turns out that this &quot; &quot; new diagnosis is not new yet yet .
The <unk> could also allow them to <unk> , treating them and even <unk> symptoms <unk> in animals , from the same decade from 1970 , from 1970 .
How many human lives could be asked if this <unk> knowledge was at the budget of the E.R. and <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some human patients are asking themselves .
You know , <unk> .
Some of the animals also get themselves to themselves .
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> once again .
But <unk> are very specific shapes and <unk> to treating it and even prevent <unk> in the animals that are going on .
Wouldn &apos;t we be this knowledge to be able to adapt to the <unk> , the parents and the patients who are fighting them ?
<unk> <unk> and psychosis .
Sometimes , as a little bit to give birth some women in depression , sometimes in depression , and even in the <unk> states .
You can introduce to his own son , and in cases it got to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> knows also that when instead of a <unk> , a little bit after the bone , it can introduce his <unk> , and then you put it in some cases , and in some cases , they would go to <unk> .
But <unk> offers a treatment to address this <unk> syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin from <unk> .
Oxytocin is the hormone of <unk> , and it causes <unk> has a renewed interest in their <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t not be this information at the risk of <unk> and <unk> , from the family doctors and the patients who are faced by the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> ?
And despite the fact that it &apos;s all this , the distance between our opened is great .
To <unk> , a lot of me I &apos;m going to have to put some of it in evidence .
There are doctors who can be <unk> with the professionals who are not <unk> in medicine .
I mean , <unk> , <unk> and psychologists , but especially at <unk> .
Now , of course , most doctors have no idea that it &apos;s more difficult to get in today in a <unk> <unk> than a million medicine , and that when we go into medicine , we learned everything we &apos;re relevant to know about a species , Homo sapiens . But the <unk> must learn about health and the diseases of mammals and mammals .
So I don &apos;t blame by the <unk> by <unk> <unk> with <unk> and ignorance .
So here &apos;s a joke from the part of the <unk> : how do you call it a little bit ?
Doctor <unk> was in my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through the programs like Darwin on <unk> <unk> , in <unk> in the <unk> in animals and biologists and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> our home and our residents .
And through the aftermath of <unk> , where we had <unk> <unk> and <unk> discussions about the diseases and the disorders of human patients and animal patients .
So in the Hebrew lectures <unk> subjects like the treatment of a chest breast cancer in a <unk> tiger , it can help us better breast cancer , a child of child childhood education ; how to understand the <unk> of a <unk> cow â€” how to understand the <unk> of a <unk> cow , and how to understand better the treatment of the width of the time .
So in the aftermath of <unk> , first in America , and now around the world , doctors and the rest of the world , doctors and <unk> leave their <unk> and <unk> them as a doctors .
For the end , we are also animal , and it &apos;s also time that we , doctors , and it &apos;s time for us , doctors , who are going to be able to communicate in a <unk> health and health care than it has all the species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and more <unk> drugs are being <unk> by doctors who are not humans .
And one of the best ways of dealing with the human patient is <unk> a lot of attention to how all other people &apos;s patients on the planet &apos;s live , they grow , <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s the key word . &quot; &quot; <unk> !
( Applause ) Having <unk> brain was , as you can imagine , as you can imagine .
I didn &apos;t know about <unk> .
In cultures , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , and in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , in cultures in the world , when you have <unk> , in cultures , when you have <unk> , and in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , and in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , and in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , in cultures , when you have
The life , a complex human being complex , is replaced by data â€” your <unk> , medical results , the results of the lab , the list of medicine ...
Suddenly you have a disease with legs .
The doctors start talking about a language that you don &apos;t .
You want to wonder with your body your body and your body your body .
People starts to change also because they &apos;re starting to treat the disease instead of the person .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What do you say the doctor ? &quot; &quot; Even before I say &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as I say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as I say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; I would say , &quot; &quot; I would say ,
Do you remember the guy who ...
Do I have to study ? How do love love ? &quot; &quot; Are they creative ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What did I do to describe this ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; I can change something in my style of life ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : there &apos;s something you can do ?
Is there any other choice ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the good guys in all cases , because they &apos;re very expressive and engaged with <unk> .
But they also are very used to treating patients , so I would say that sometimes they lost the perspective of the view that you &apos;re an torture and that you &apos;re an torture , and you would say , literally , a patient .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is that we have <unk> <unk> of any way to know your situation in doing your situation and friends or in <unk> some way to modify your style of life to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going on .
But with all , it &apos;s going to thank you to your hands of your own series of taking a lot of jobs .
Whereas I was in the hospital , I asked them that I was interviewing me from my <unk> <unk> to me that I was in the hospital .
It was very hard to do , because it &apos;s not very commonplace to ask a picture of your own <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked to him , and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we don &apos;t know me .
I &apos;m more like this .
The cure is , it &apos;s what it &apos;s going to have to deal with all of my own . &quot; &quot; So the next cure in the hospital is the <unk> medicine .
I was decided to change my relationship with the <unk> and I was decided to learn more about him before I do something as a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , use many kinds of technologies to open and open information in my work .
So my great bet was spreading all the data , forming the data , and do it in such a way that it could be able to be able to be able to do it .
So I created a website called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created
In fact , I had to <unk> , but that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about another talk .
( Laughter ) <unk> this word , &quot; &quot; La <unk> , &quot; &quot; because in Italian means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; can have many meanings .
In our secular culture , it means to be able to change the disease , but in other cultures , but in other different cultures as for example , the Mediterranean , of the <unk> , or Africa , can represent many other things .
So of course I interested in the opinion of doctors and the rest of the health professionals , but also me interested in the <unk> proposal for an artist , by the poet , by the <unk> , or whatever , by the musicians .
It &apos;s called social <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all sorts of <unk> .
And it worked .
The site La <unk> would come around the world .
<unk> lots of <unk> <unk> of Italy and the <unk> and the most of 500 people came up with me very little time through emails , social media , social media â€” most of them were counseling of how to do my <unk> , but many more they were intrigued of how to do it .
For example , <unk> thousands of videos , images , photos and <unk> <unk> to La <unk> .
We &apos;ve got this example of Francesca <unk> and his <unk> .
Or what he did was called <unk> <unk> : <unk> sculpture , a 3D <unk> of my pituitary tumor and <unk> it into <unk> .
Now you can have my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s a great thing , you can share the same <unk> .
And this was what I was happening : scientists , experts in traditional medicine , various researchers , various researchers â€” they all were connected to me to <unk> .
Given this information , and support , I was able to collect a team of neurosurgeons to traditional doctors , traditional doctors , <unk> and many hundreds of <unk> that I could talk about the data , which is very important .
<unk> , we can formulate an strategy from my own <unk> in different languages and across different cultures .
So the current strategy required <unk> the entire world and thousands of years of human history , I think I find quite a sense .
&#91; unclear &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91;
So I could take my time to spend .
<unk> the doctor who I wanted to work , I was going to run out the hospital when I wanted to be , and all while thousands of people were disrespectful to me .
All the world felt that could be <unk> <unk> , and this was the most important part of La <unk> .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) <unk> bad news : I have â€” wow , I &apos;m â€” wow , I was â€” a very low <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> <unk> that it &apos;s not too much .
I changed my life and my lifestyle life .
And it was very intense , and it was very intense , and he was very intense , he had a network of electrodes connected to my brain on this side , to build a functional map of what the brain is controlling .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the doctor to understand the risks I was going to run and if there was something I &apos;d like to avoid .
It &apos;s obviously <unk> .
This whole key was the very key to La <unk> .
<unk> of people shared their stories , their stories .
The doctors came to talk to people who usually don &apos;t care when it &apos;s about <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell me , I &apos;m in a <unk> state of a lot of different languages , where the science is contained with emotion and the modern research with the traditional <unk> .
&#91; <unk> &#93; The key point of La La <unk> was <unk> part of a truly engaged society and connected to the global well-being of each of their individuals .
This world <unk> is my <unk> code for <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I can &apos;t tell you what it is to be .
I didn &apos;t know that there was to be a song before .
So I think I &apos;ll start with what I &apos;m going to start with .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before I was nothing , I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , ( Applause ) <unk> Travis on the ground . ( Applause )
<unk> , as we call it , is an incredible space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that makes <unk> is that we don &apos;t give us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
We &apos;re working on this moment .
There are so many decisions when you go to <unk> .
We didn &apos;t have no idea what we were coming .
So we &apos;ve done a interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; But that could happen .
All listening . We respond .
There &apos;s no time for <unk> ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s more easy to talk about someone else &apos;s error .
So the way I &apos;m going to make a mistake when I &apos;m in <unk> â€” before nothing , you don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake that you don &apos;t have to understand what another is what another did is .
Every <unk> is a chance in jazz .
Even it &apos;s hard to describe what it would be a fun .
For example , if I &apos;m painting a color , just as if you &apos;re playing with the palette , you would look like this ...
( Music ) ( Music ) If Christian rings .
You see , everything fits in the palette of color .
If it comes to light .
You see , all of you see it in the interior of this book that we &apos;re painting .
And yet , if you touch <unk> .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this palette .
At the moment , Christian summer will add this .
And we &apos;re not going to respond to it .
I &apos;ll touch it for a second , and then I &apos;d go to stop and talk to a moment .
We &apos;re going to see what happens when we touch this palette .
( Music ) ( Music ) <unk> , somebody could <unk> as a mistake .
I would only say that it &apos;s about a mistake , if you don &apos;t care before .
A lost opportunity .
So it &apos;s <unk> . We &apos;re going to paint this palette again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to look at it , but something will switch .
We &apos;re going to embrace your ideas , or not .
( Music ) ( Music ) Did you see it .
And I created a melody .
This time changed the texture .
It was a little bit more rhythmic , a little bit more intense .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is , if you &apos;re not conscious , if every musician is not conscious , and I don &apos;t care to their partners to identify the idea , and we &apos;re not going to allow creativity .
This <unk> is really incredible .
It &apos;s a <unk> experience .
And I know why I &apos;m talking about all when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that to be able to climb to <unk> and to make music is a blessing .
What do you have to do this ?
We are all musicians of jazz , our <unk> is not the most accurate for finance .
( Laughter ) I just wanted to show you how it is .
And the other thing is that we don &apos;t have <unk> in jazz .
There are people who do it .
But it &apos;s accurate the odds .
If you look at the band , you would say , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you about it .
Come on , <unk> something .
One , two , two , three , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s a little <unk> , because I &apos;ve <unk> the ideas .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> by this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music down there , the best I can do is to listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more than seeing what I can understand what I can do .
If I want music to take a certain level of <unk> , the first step for me is being patient , listening to what happens and collect something what happens to me .
When you do it , you <unk> and <unk> the other musicians and they were more , and so that &apos;s going to do it .
Look . One , two , two , two , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s something totally different when I shot my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more <unk> .
It &apos;s not about to get my vision wrong .
It &apos;s about to be at the moment , it &apos;s going to be one of the other and let me give you the creativity .
Thank you .

And I &apos;m going to be sincere , especially these incredible talks and ideas that are being exposed to , <unk> on the position of it &apos;s going on here to tell you about the television .
All the world sees the television .
<unk> . <unk> some things .
So here in America , people <unk> .
The media is a <unk> , a <unk> , almost five hours of day .
Well ?
<unk> me , I live on television , so that &apos;s me , it &apos;s a <unk> .
But people don &apos;t like .
They did it .
<unk> that it &apos;s useless , and things worse , <unk> .
My mother , when I was a girl , <unk> &quot; &quot; The <unk> box . &quot; &quot; My intention is not <unk> if there &apos;s the good television or bad television ; my idea today is what I think I think the television have consciousness .
If I think the television is consciousness is because I think that the television of it directly understands the moral needs , social and emotional political and <unk> in our nation â€” the television is how we rely on our values .
And all of that is intrinsic to humans , and it &apos;s empowering to our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good or bad television .
We talk about <unk> television .
We talk about 10 to the width of the audience for a <unk> period .
So how did it reflects it , not only what you &apos;ve heard , which is the idea of our social social unconscious and collective collective , if we don &apos;t , as the 10 programs during the age of our social consciousness ?
So how do we get television along the time , and what tells you to do this to our society ?
And it turns out to the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , whether it &apos;s <unk> that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four primary primary instincts .
<unk> , relationships , power , and the desire of <unk> .
As humans , what you have to remember is that we &apos;re going to <unk> with the time until we were able to use these basic animal instincts .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel fear , compassion .
This is not like this in the animal kingdom .
The other thing we &apos;ve described human beings is we love the entertainment .
You see the television .
This is something that &apos;s really clearly about the animal world .
As animals can play , but they don &apos;t know by looking at it .
So I &apos;m aiming to discover what understands from this human relationship between humans between the television and human consciousness .
So why the hell evolved that ?
The kid said , &quot; &quot; <unk> like the hell of the y-axis and the <unk> sitting in our shoulder .
The television works like our consciousness , <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
To try to challenge these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
<unk> 50 years to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> at the flow of the audience at the audience had been over 50 years â€” thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people almost almost <unk> â€” about 18 and 70 years , and it turns out how to <unk> emotionally .
How would you remember watching each of these programs ?
Do you want a moral moral ?
Did you get <unk> ? <unk> ?
What &apos;s meant for you ?
For our TED audience , I mean that this <unk> cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of the emotional need are universal .
And second , an 80 percent of the most popular programs from the United States is the rest of the world .
I want to tell you our audience <unk> if you feel <unk> .
I want to give you a lot of people before coming to the first slide : Why <unk> inspired me to think about the idea of consciousness and the <unk> that consciousness can be <unk> in the day the day , and Jack Stern .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to paste the data , I want to give you a thank you .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
Here , from 1960 , since 1960 , 50 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things we &apos;re going to start with the state of inspiration and the state of moral <unk> , which , for this study , defined as the television shows that they &apos;re going to make me feel better about the world .
<unk> moral <unk> are the programs we don &apos;t have the difference between good and bad .
At principle , you see that in 1960 the 1960 <unk> <unk> .
So we see the television .
<unk> morality starts to mobilize .
I &apos;m going to end up the back of 60 , <unk> moral <unk> , and the downtown <unk> .
Why ?
The crisis of California , the <unk> and <unk> , the movement by the rights of <unk> , ignored racial , the Vietnam War , the <unk> , the Vietnam War , the <unk> <unk> .
Look what happens .
1970 <unk> <unk> .
<unk> moral <unk> .
<unk> , more Ronald Reagan , a television record , is in control .
It &apos;s going to raise the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t say , the <unk> , the <unk> , Chernobyl , Chernobyl .
<unk> moral <unk> becomes the dominant tendency for 1990 to 20 years .
You &apos;ll take a look at this .
This graph shows a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the happiness <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in blue and green .
At that time , we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and national programs that <unk> happiness .
It &apos;s going to increase .
<unk> starts to rise .
<unk> the social methodology increases .
We come to 1969 and look what happens .
The happiness , the <unk> and the social comment , not only they are in our society , but there &apos;s no longer in our society , but there &apos;s a number two and number three up in 1969 .
What was the number one ?
The very remarkable number is <unk> <unk> , <unk> and Martin
All <unk> together .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
So let &apos;s see this green peak in <unk> with a couple of trends .
When I was a term , successful unprecedented , I mean ?
I mean that in <unk> <unk> , the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; came from <unk> .
This was the first program that I was saying to say , &quot; &quot; my god , I can comment on what I think of the Vietnam War , about the president , through the TV &quot; &quot; ? That &apos;s what means an unprecedented success .
Well , the same thing in the last graph look what happens .
1970 , <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television by entertainment .
The social comment and <unk> <unk> over 70 .
Now look at this .
Who <unk> the 70 ? Norman Lear .
We have &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the main program in the technologies 10 than the decade of the 70 ...
In 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs we study came out during the Vietnam War , five of the <unk> <unk> .
Only a generation , for 20 years , and we &apos;ve discovered , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
Could you feel that ?
Can you fix it ?
The audience so I knew , I mean , I want to tell the people of the digital people not invented problems .
Archie Bunker was pushed out of his <unk> together with the rest of us a <unk> .
This is another chart . In other <unk> , <unk> other <unk> : <unk> and imagination , who are planning as well as &quot; &quot; <unk> of reality . &quot; &quot; It makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So that &apos;s a statistic of the <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;ll tell you that every time that <unk> and imagination would get it away from the stop .
We want to see programs about people saving money and stop ?
We don &apos;t . In the 70s we &apos;ve got the final leader called &quot; &quot; The woman <unk> &quot; &quot; which is <unk> to the <unk> <unk> in 1973 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six million dollars of &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Fox . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s â€” another peak of <unk> and power .
What was in the programs ?
<unk> and rich .
&quot; Where &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
A <unk> shows from our national psyche , with rapid and tough : I stop .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
Whether it &apos;s not in my <unk> , sure you have to be sure or <unk> about the fall of the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> .
As you say in this <unk> , the slope of the place .
<unk> , the decade of humor , <unk> like &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) All right .
But look , the slope of the place .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , the <unk> of the judgment .
Why not ?
We had the presidential 2000s of the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> technology .
The third of September .
The <unk> <unk> in part of social diversity .
It turns out what happens with time .
In the change , the Internet is <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What do you want to people in your case ?
And I would argue that it was <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> happiness , my world are below .
Don &apos;t you want to judge .
I can get it out of the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin dance .
I can spend the new <unk> . You &apos;re <unk> .
Great , yeah ?
It turns out to radically different things that are these programs , pure entertainment , were there for 50 years â€” that &apos;s what I said at the beginning of the beginning ?
We are animals , we need our mommies .
There didn &apos;t be a <unk> decade with a <unk> and dominant mother .
In the next decade of the <unk> : June <unk> in the <unk> program , they <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of social consciousness in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the archetype of the <unk> <unk> , who talked about abortion , <unk> , even in the television .
In the 1980s , it &apos;s the first <unk> <unk> way of Alexis <unk> .
( Music ) ( Video ) <unk> Brown <unk> with a <unk> when I had a thought of being a single mother .
The mother of this was , he <unk> Van <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a demo or a reminder of our consciousness , sitting in our consciousness , what I know is that I love this picture .
So all of us , women and men from <unk> , the audience of <unk> , thank you for <unk> to my notion of television .
But also let me give you a lot of the <unk> that <unk> in the morning to <unk> their ideas on our fingertips in our fingertips .
Dan his own life in the television , secure , but you &apos;re concerned about it , through the collective social social consciousness , <unk> life , or not .
So thank you so much .
( Applause )
In 1994 , I came in a prison in <unk> , and I met a child from 12 years that came up and said , &quot; &quot; Well , in 1994 , I would have a lawyer .
And when I went to my eyes , I realized that from the hundreds of letters that I had written to politicians , never told them any letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t a eight-year-old that made something important to someone .
It wasn &apos;t a political player .
It was a child from 12 years old .
So what I &apos;ve also realized was that it wasn &apos;t just that it wasn &apos;t just in <unk> , but that &apos;s not just <unk> , but that &apos;s the developing world in the developing world that we have , 93 of these countries made laws that have the right to one lawyer .
And I realized that there were an incredible <unk> of opportunities for all of us as a global community for all of us as a global global ethic of research .
As we think of torture in torture as a form of political torture or a political torture or it &apos;s reserved for only the worst , but in fact , 95 percent of the <unk> today are not for political .
They are to people who are in the <unk> systems , and unfortunately , the <unk> is the most <unk> way of research â€” it &apos;s cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper to them , is what happens most of the time .
The day of science today is that it &apos;s possible for us as a global community , if we take that decision , and then we end up with torture as a research method for our lives , but this has become three things .
First comes the ability , the power of power and the connection to global global scale .
The second one is to guarantee that there is a noninvasive access and systematic space .
And the third is the commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started <unk> , and if we did it ?
Could we do something about this about 93 countries ?
And I founded <unk> <unk> to <unk> that he has a specific quest to end with the torture method of research and put it into practice as a research method and put it into a <unk> stage in <unk> in <unk> countries , and he &apos;s offered him .
However , my first experiences came from <unk> and the <unk> of my first visit to <unk> , when there was , in 1994 , even less than 10 of the country in the country because the <unk> <unk> <unk> all .
And even 20 years later , so it was only 10 of the country in the country and so forth , by the way , in a prison , not only <unk> a eight-year-old , but it would be <unk> with women too , and the <unk> &quot; &quot; Why are you right here ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a place where it didn &apos;t exist .
The first group of <unk> <unk> and I still remember , while I asked me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do to investigate ? &quot;
And the room goes on silence and finally a woman called &quot; &quot; name <unk> , &quot; &quot; and he said &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got more than a lot of people and I have no research , because all of the fact that it means &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got more than a lot of people and I have no research , because all of the
And these advocates , they had to <unk> the value to decide to defend themselves and <unk> between them to be able to put it into practice these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where it was , the top of it , the top of it and the rest behind , and they <unk> , while the <unk> stopped saying , &quot; &quot; No , not , we &apos;re not going to do things the same way in the same way in which you have been done until now . &quot; &quot; But one day was the perfect case .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s actually seen a person going to run out and believe that I would take the <unk> in a question , but the police came , and she didn &apos;t have nothing on it .
So then she was <unk> . She had <unk> emails .
And when he took his case to a judge , for the first time this <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for the <unk> and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no test except for the <unk> , and so it will be covered in freedom . &quot; &quot; And the judge started taking cases one and again , and as you &apos;re going to start taking cases , starting the course of the story of the story of <unk> .
But it &apos;s not true .
He used to think , then it &apos;s just <unk> ?
Or also happen in other countries ?
But what happens in so many countries â€” there are so many countries â€” there are so many countries .
And when I walked into a prison and there was no eight-year-old , but a child &apos;s eight-year-old that would take a cell phone .
Or a woman , I sat in arms on his baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But he was not a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here by her , but I &apos;m not here by stealing two <unk> and a iron in his baby and still in prison .
And when I went along with the director of prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> in freedom .
A shared judge will get rid of it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can take it , but look at my prison , and the 80 percent of the two thousands of people here are no lawyers . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers had the <unk> to organize a system where they could take cases .
And we realized that it wasn &apos;t just the lawyers and the lawyers , but the duties of the lawyers that we have <unk> the difference .
For example , in <unk> , what happened was that &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; <unk> <unk> &#93; wasn &apos;t true , but it was the same way , in China , always telling me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a cool wind in the Thar Desert when we can <unk> . &quot; &quot; Or in <unk> , where the world was like a cool wind in the desert when the whole world came and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve heard that we can &apos;t help create fairness , we don &apos;t need to be able to develop fairness , we don &apos;t need the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want to tell you that the lack of resources never was <unk> to the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And with this organized a successful song that manages to reach the cases of systematic .
So , the solution that we found was the ability and then , the access to <unk> .
I was a little bit I &apos;ve been in <unk> and I decided to <unk> with another group of lawyers , and what I realized was that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have the streets .
What &apos;s done then ? &quot; &quot; <unk> with one of the development agencies , and they were forming <unk> and <unk> , which turns out to be the normal molecule , instead of it .
It &apos;s also a manual <unk> textbook .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And they were all on it . The lawyers can come to the police station .
<unk> are perfectly trained .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . &quot; &quot; Before all of you go to the valuation of the valuation , what happened to them while ?
And by so much the key pieces are not only all the lawyers , but they have to find a way to keep a way to get rid of the access to space , because they are the guarantee in the system for people who are being tortured .
And while I &apos;m going to tell you this , they &apos;re also aware that it sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , seems like if you could do it , but you &apos;re going to do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it looks pretty big .
And it &apos;s a lot of reasons why I think we &apos;re possible .
The first one is that the people about California are the people on the way to create miracles .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> , who I talked to you in <unk> , but it also changed all around the world that they are looking for different pieces .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people who were <unk> and who wanted to help , but how could we do it ?
So so much is a competition in line where you can gain five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to win a $ <unk> idea of <unk> .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> around the world , from Sri Lankan to <unk> or <unk> , or the Democratic Republic of Congo , who had five billion dollars of SMS things , through SMS programs and some way that they see .
And there &apos;s not just these <unk> , but it &apos;s also there , but there are also people who are their contacts and how they can work with them .
For example , in China &apos;s <unk> laws that <unk> the cops were told to people , they had punished .
And while I was sitting along with one of our lawyers lawyers , I said , &quot; &quot; And how can we build it ? How can we build it ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have money ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s still a way . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s still the way . &quot; &quot; And the 4 October began to three billion members of the U.S. State of the Greek <unk> , of the <unk> school members of the United States , of the <unk> of the <unk> schools
I &apos;ve been talking about the fact that we need to form and support .
We need to move into practical ways to commit access to space .
But the third and last point of point , the most important thing is that we have <unk> with this .
And usually the people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well , but it &apos;s too idealistic .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same view that if we were allowed to end the people who were expected to end the slavery , or apartheid .
It started with a small group of people who decided to <unk> .
One of our favorite poems of teachers , who they share themselves between themselves , is , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to be value , friends , the way it &apos;s going to be long , the route never is clear , and there &apos;s a lot on game , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of a lot on game , but at the bottom , you &apos;re not <unk> as a global community of research .
And I &apos;ve always wondered , because I know the question will be , and it &apos;s going to be a pleasure to talk to you in a moment , &quot; But what can I do ? &quot; &quot; Well , secondly , you know what you can do . And secondly , we &apos;ve been able to figure out what you can do . And secondly , <unk> with the story of <unk> , which was made my inspiration to assembled the <unk> .
<unk> was a three-year-old eight-year-old when I met him in a <unk> prison in <unk> <unk> . But as a <unk> in prison , they all had a lot of <unk> , even the <unk> , so it was the only one that could come out and run out of the <unk> .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s <unk> . And so when we were able to <unk> , which is what it also grows ? The head .
What I was doing was to go through the first <unk> , and the second and then the third one , and then , very , very , very carefully , <unk> his head to be able to <unk> through and <unk> : from the third to the first one . And he <unk> his finger , because what he wanted to do was to go visit .
Now , of course , I never had to visit the entire world every day , but she wanted to visit the whole world , and then he wanted to visit all of his fingers .
Or if the cells were dark , it was like a <unk> , and it turned their fingers through .
And most of the <unk> <unk> that was his biggest <unk> and his sun and the sun and all the <unk> <unk> . And I thought , here &apos;s a <unk> .
Born in a prison without nothing , without anything , without a sense of his own <unk> , who in my view of his own view , that in my opinion all of you . And I told me , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t answer that .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I &apos;m going to do the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so that &apos;s why I would argue by having the imagination of a new world with all of us together and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for the TED Talks , &quot; Be a Talk on a red red . &quot;
If a story applies .
&quot; <unk> a personal secret . &quot;
<unk> with me with <unk> with the action .
No .
It &apos;s not just like you think of a TED .
In fact , if we were <unk> too much of these mechanisms , we would get a <unk> or a emotional <unk> .
But there &apos;s one thing that all the TED Talks are in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because I &apos;m going to share with you , because I &apos;m going to tell you , because I &apos;m going to talk to you , listening to a lot of TED Talks .
<unk> with their talks of high audiences , and I learned directly by the secrets of a great Talk .
And yet these <unk> and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common ingredient .
And it &apos;s this : The main task as a <unk> is to transfer the mind of who you hear a remarkable gift , an unusual and beautiful object that we call a sense .
Let me <unk> .
This is <unk> .
It &apos;s about giving a TED Talk , and , frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> Van <unk> !
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So , one 200 people , a lot of what you never saw before feel that your brains are going to hit the brain of <unk> and between themselves .
They &apos;re literally starting to <unk> the same same patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they are preventing the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to make a look at the brain by taking a moment .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look at here , right here : a few billion are wired between themselves in a way that represents a simple idea .
within the entire audience .
It &apos;s like this ; it &apos;s just a couple of minutes , a pattern that involves millions of neurons to one 200 heads , only with people listening to a voice and look for a face .
But <unk> , which is an idea ?
Well , you can <unk> as a pattern of information that helps us understand and navigate the world .
The ideas came out of many ways and <unk> , from the complex and <unk> , and it turns out to look at it .
So here &apos;s a couple of examples of <unk> examples from the TED stage .
Sir Ken Robinson <unk> creativity is the key of our future of our kids .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : What is the creativity that the creativity now is , and we have <unk> with the same status .
( Applause ) Chris Anderson : <unk> Hardy <unk> with <unk> is beautiful .
( Video ) <unk> 4 : <unk> around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , resists <unk> .
CA : Well , let &apos;s <unk> by <unk> people &apos;s more than a simple identity .
Video : <unk> <unk> : The simple story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not to be false .
CA : Your mind makes ideas , and you don &apos;t get randomly .
They &apos;re emotionally connected .
It turns out , make an incredible framework that is your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like <unk> across the world .
And it <unk> from millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a small component of your world &apos;s view is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is going to <unk> it .
But if another component of your world &apos;s view of the world is the idea that leopards is dangerous , then the green is kind of a little different .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your view of the world are crucial .
So let me tell you that the most insidious thing that is possible , a guide to the <unk> , but wonderful world of that outside .
Now , different visions in the world of people can be very different .
For example , how responds your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , even &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot;
Or &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; a terrorist .
CA : Whatever it is the answer , there &apos;s millions of people there that are very different .
If you &apos;re in the right way , you are able to change , forever , the way you see the world and transform their actions so much now like the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that <unk> the human culture .
So if you would argue that your main task as <unk> is to build an idea in your audiences of your audiences , there &apos;s four <unk> to address that task : First , <unk> your talk to one idea .
The ideas are complex things ; we need to reduce the content to be able to get rid of the simple idea that more of you , and having the chance to do it well .
You have to give context , share examples , do it real .
So I &apos;m going to give you a sense of , and you would argue that it &apos;s a thread that makes all your talk , so that all the ones that <unk> relies in way .
And secondly , I &apos;m going to tell you a reason for you to talk about .
Before we start to build things in your audiences of your audiences , you have to have their permission to come .
And what is the tool to do ?
Curiosity .
It tells me about your audience .
We ask questions <unk> , <unk> questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t have meaning and accurate .
If you can reveal a <unk> on your view of the world of somebody , you would take the need to meet that gap of knowledge .
And when I <unk> that wish is much easier to start to build the idea .
Third , <unk> your idea , a piece of storytelling that your audience tells you .
<unk> the power of language to weave especially concepts that have already been in the mind of who &apos;s hearing but not in your language , in their language .
You know where they are .
<unk> the kid who have many of us who have a lot of concepts and concepts with that they &apos;re completely <unk> for their audiences .
Well , metaphors to play a crucial role to show how fit the bits , because it offers us the bits of the pattern , based on a sense that who listen to it .
For instance , when Jennifer Jennifer was explaining the incredible new biotech centers called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you have a text text to editing DNA .
<unk> allows us to cut and take information together very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , an explanation , a graph like this was a big moment of <unk> while it fits in your mind .
It &apos;s important , for so much , to be able to talk to talk with friends of trust , and see that parts are more <unk> .
<unk> . Here &apos;s the end â€” it &apos;s going to get your ideas to be <unk> .
So in this mean , I mean you &apos;ll do this question , &quot; What does this mean ? &quot;
And I need to be honest with the answer .
If it &apos;s only only to benefit from you and your own organization , then I feel like , probably don &apos;t care about it .
The audience will see through you .
But if you take it out that the idea has the potential to <unk> their days or to change the perspective of somebody to better or inspire somebody to do things in another way , then you have the essential ingredient for a good presentation of truth , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
It &apos;s only one 25 percent than we &apos;ve heard .
( Laughter ) So let me tell you that all of all days I would argue that all of the days I would argue that all of the days would take care of all the days you would have to take care of all of these days you would have to take care of all of all days you would have to take care of all of these days .
( <unk> ) So with this <unk> continues that it works hard to listen .
And the art of the conversation is the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art
A world where we &apos;re not listening to each other to each other .
To <unk> , and to recalibrate the ear , to <unk> , and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> , to <unk> , and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> , to <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear , and to recalibrate the ear , to <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear , and to recalibrate the ear , to <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear
It &apos;s about appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my <unk> .
So you see that ordinary sounds can be very interesting if you get attention .
The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine you &apos;re in a street class of any place of America and it &apos;s got a <unk> and <unk> : &quot; Sorry , what is the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> ... &quot; &quot; â€” this is the <unk> <unk> , is that it &apos;s <unk> Street .
This is the middle street , that the 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What is the name of that apple ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; Well , the apples don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , the apples they &apos;re only <unk> without the name between the streets .
Now , imagine that you &apos;re in a street sports street , <unk> to the person who you have on the side and ask questions , &quot; Did you call it this street ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the apple apple and that the 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this little girl ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t .
Things .
Look Google Maps here . There &apos;s the apple requirements , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 .
All of these apples have names , and the streets are only the <unk> with the name between apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know your home ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is the <unk> 8 .
<unk> 17 , home number one . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Okay . But walking by the <unk> , I watched the numbers of the houses are not in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course .
The first house was <unk> in an apple is the number one .
The second house that we built is the two two .
The third one is the first three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; I love it , we have to go on the other side of the world to give us a lot of things that would allow us to be true .
Like , for example , there are doctors in China who believe their work is normal .
So every month that you &apos;re healthy , you have to <unk> , and when you get it , you won &apos;t pay because whatever you do in your job . They &apos;re rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) We think it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the strong time , the beginning of music , and one , two , three , four .
But at the end of west of Africa , the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , like the end of a sentence .
So let me hear not only in the <unk> , but in the way , I mean , two , three , four , one .
And this map also is true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s one said that we states that for any true thing I &apos;ll say about India , the opposite will be true .
So we didn &apos;t have never yet yet , so in TED as another place , that for any brilliant idea that we have or <unk> , the same thing can be true .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
