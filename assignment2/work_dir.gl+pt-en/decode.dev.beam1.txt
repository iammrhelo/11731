( Arabic ) <unk> in Allah , <unk> , <unk> .
( <unk> ) <unk> in a family class .
My father was five years when she lost his father , but when I was <unk> , he was already a business man .
If their children were children or girls , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children
So I suppose I was <unk> .
My mother was <unk> 16 times .
Of the 16 <unk> , we &apos;re alive five .
You can imagine why I had to pass when I was a kid .
<unk> , there were women being transported to <unk> , or children being brought to a <unk> .
At that moment , when I graduated from high school , I &apos;m really going to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I would argue my education , more <unk> to the university .
<unk> , in my country , there was no women in the <unk> , which still was in the medical school , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father would <unk> America .
I watched in America .
I just just talked about my studies .
Whereas I was interviewing my education , Russia <unk> my country .
You know , when I was walking my training , I would argue what I was happening to my family and my country .
<unk> months , and I had no news .
My family would have been in a <unk> field .
So instead I finished studying the studies , I would tell my family .
I wanted to get safe .
But where I was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I was interested in the news , when it was still the <unk> in my country , it would be the heart .
I would go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go to me because there was no place to me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a university .
It was okay .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
They were living with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to tell my home .
So we would have to go to the field of <unk> .
And when I arrived at the <unk> field of <unk> , there was seven million and a half of <unk> . Seven million and a half of <unk> .
<unk> , black &apos; 90s were women and children , and Americans , or they were in the war , or they were in it , and they know what ?
When he was doing the <unk> , I was doing things that didn &apos;t get away .
I watched a widow with five and eight children , and I sit there , and I don &apos;t know what to do .
I watched a new woman who had no idea where to go , without the schools , or not a place in the living in the living .
I watched kids who have lost their parents , their <unk> and a 15-year-old , a sweet , and a sweet , she had to take away their families , be the head of family and try to protect their siblings , their moms and children .
The situation was absolutely <unk> .
My heart <unk> by my people and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
In that moment , it &apos;s a impulse .
In that moment , I felt like , I &apos;m like , I can do for these people ?
How can I get <unk> ?
I &apos;m a single person , I can do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew my education was going to be my life .
It was <unk> . It &apos;s going to take a position .
They put trust . They &apos;ll give a career .
He took the underground back to my family , to take my family to another country , so they were safe .
And at the point I knew that what was meant to my people was education and health and that was what we could get .
But think , you think it was easy ?
Because not , because of that , women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Furthermore , after the <unk> in Afghanistan , people don &apos;t have no longer <unk> .
It was very hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who are I ?
Anybody who comes from the United States .
Some of you who have been here .
I would ask me to me ? &quot; &quot; So of course , I &apos;m not .
So what really did was he offered to make trust this community .
How do I do it ?
I went to <unk> , I watched and I watched .
I &apos;ve done questions .
I found that I found a man .
I had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
I went to his tent in the <unk> and <unk> the proposal , &quot; I want to take a teacher . &quot;
And I would say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; as you think I can be professor ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll do you , I can &apos;t be professor ? &quot; &quot; And I finally said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll do you , and instead I started with a guy in his <unk> , I was finally on a class in his <unk> , <unk> his voice .
In a year , we had 25 million deaths , 15,000 children go to school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So of course , we were doing our work , forming teachers , and they were <unk> in the women of women , human rights , democracy and laws . They found all sorts of action . And one day , you know , it &apos;s going to do our work , forming teachers .
One day I was in the office in <unk> , a day , I was in the office in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a day , I was in the office in <unk> , and one day I was in the office in <unk> , a day in <unk> , <unk> , a day , and a day , I was in the office in <unk> , and one day I was in the office in <unk> , a day in <unk> , <unk> , a day , and a day , I was in the
And suddenly , I saw my personal life was walking the doors and <unk> doors , and suddenly I saw my personal shoulder was to sit down the doors and <unk> , and he was the leader , who do it ?
You know , you know it &apos;s dangerous . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is in play .
But as a leader , you have to keep the <unk> .
You have to keep the <unk> and show a fortress .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And these people would have been <unk> to my office office .
So the <unk> in the office .
<unk> . Three nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine ,
These were the most <unk> men who can see never .
( Laughter ) People with <unk> <unk> , black clothes , and his mass in the outside of my office .
And I would walk and take a cup .
<unk> . They didn &apos;t go to tea .
And of course , the pitch of voice that was going to be too afraid , and I was really impaired .
But at the same time , I &apos;m going to <unk> .
And of course , at the moment , you see , you see how seen it , 5am your head by a black armband , a black armband , and of course , at the moment , you see how seen it , and of course , at the moment , you see how a seen , standing away from feet to a black armband , and of course , at the moment , you see how a seen , standing away from feet to a black armband , and of course , at the moment , you see
The only thing I saw was the eyes .
<unk> : What do we do ?
&quot; Don &apos;t know that the school would have <unk> women ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And , they know , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , where the school is ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And he went to me and said , &quot; &quot; So I wanted to tell you , &quot; &quot; — I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s your house .
You &apos;ll come back some students . We all teach the Koran , the holy book .
You know , the Koran says that if you were to get the holy book that women might be good wives , and they may obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to ask one thing : this is how it &apos;s about that people . ( Laughter ) At that moment , it &apos;s like this people who were going to talk to you .
They were found between them and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ll tell you I would have ever been and got it a <unk> and got a <unk> and <unk> .
So my personal <unk> in mass of my office office .
They were dead .
They didn &apos;t know how to <unk> me .
They didn &apos;t know how they didn &apos;t care about them .
With all of all , we all were <unk> .
All of it , and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) So of course , I was alive .
But also , by getting <unk> during the fall of <unk> , when the <unk> had the power was another story .
They were <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> students , which would have been <unk> by the <unk> .
And so , as they fall out of the <unk> , we went through the country and we open a school after another .
We opened up school centers .
We opened clinics without .
We worked with women and children .
<unk> about health care .
They were <unk> how many kinds of designs can be .
I was very happy . I was <unk> with the result of my work .
And one day , when I was going to spend four and a ski floor , I would run to North Kabul , suddenly , once you would have a more <unk> on the middle of the road , they had 19 kids .
In <unk> back , they &apos;ll take the road .
I would ask my driver &apos;s about me and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , you have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; I put my name and said , &quot; &quot; You know , she &apos;s my name and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and <unk> .
At that moment , women would go into the car .
I &apos;m very impaired and <unk> : &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
This time , I will kill everyone .
She had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , you would have to be the whole way you think about and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You &apos;ll see it in your <unk> , and you can follow that .
So I would sit on one side of the car .
My leg would go and walk out of the car .
( Laughter ) <unk> : &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; &quot; You know what I did ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Come on every day of one place .
<unk> women , they &apos;re going to be able to give a job to have a job .
<unk> . What about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What about us ?
What we &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay .
So we know , the only thing we can do , for the time I hear in the time I &apos;d been living , is to get a gun and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; And you know what it means .
Obviously , it was a trap .
So I would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll go and say &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I went on the car , I sat down , and I said to the driver &apos;s <unk> : it &apos;s going back and threw it out to the door .
We just had money to <unk> them , to get them to school , and nothing more .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all the <unk> <unk> .
They would get their houses . Nobody had a foot .
My dorm was the only one I was there and I would <unk> without voice .
I was <unk> , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;ve got education for education .
Hundreds of women said to the <unk> .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly , we &apos;re here talking about pulses , because at the moment , one of my wonderful favorite <unk> would have been <unk> a report .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote him .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not you . What do you want ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing .
It was equal to me , I didn &apos;t believe , and it was not asking me .
&quot; &quot; Okay , tell you that &apos;s going on . &quot;
It &apos;s going to give all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , go and get it up and get them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when I was two days later , I did the same way , know how to think , know , they were a little further away , the same kids , there were a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s been <unk> and <unk> to stop the car .
So I stopped the car .
I was saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , I &apos;ll go with me . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m going to go with me . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> condition : you know , you know what I say . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
So the next step came to the mosque and to sum up , had it <unk> teachers .
Now , they are the best educators .
<unk> English , learning how to be used , teach computer computer and are my <unk> .
The areas we don &apos;t know in the mountain areas , they come to me . They go ahead and go .
And we <unk> .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s the education to change people .
When we <unk> the people , they change and , in today , we need to work for equality .
You can &apos;t educate women and <unk> men from men , because men are the people who were more difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started asking them , because they must be conscious of the women &apos;s potential , knowing how much of the women who are men and who are those women who are themselves in .
So we form men continuously and I think deeply deeply deeply deeply deeply deeply .
I live in a country that live in a country that live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful .
They would take all the parts .
Women &apos;s <unk> education : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — and we went from a house to another .
Don &apos;t <unk> the doors .
But you know , I know it &apos;s happening to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of the security problems .
But we still want Afghanistan before .
And I want to tell you about another part .
Now , women in Afghanistan work very hard , very hard .
They were going to be <unk> . They were <unk> to be <unk> .
They were going to be <unk> , again .
They were going to be <unk> and paste .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people are used all of their potential and all of this will happen .
I want to share with you for you for love , by compassion , for trust and by honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;ll succeed .
We have a poet , <unk> <unk> .
He said , if you have compassion and if you have love , you can make it the world .
And we <unk> , we were .
And if we were to Afghanistan , I &apos;m going to be safe by 100 percent that can make it happen .
Thank you , so many , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So I was <unk> at UCLA , University of California , <unk> <unk> techniques .
I was asked by that was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A old <unk> <unk> <unk> with facial <unk> and <unk> <unk> that was a brain <unk> .
You would remember if you could go to the zoo of the brain , you can see it in the <unk> , and you &apos;ll look at a possible cause of heart cause to search for a possible cause of heart cause to search for a possible cause of heart causes to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for
We would let it clear that the U.S. <unk> of the United States , and highly <unk> <unk> that care of their own animals are very good for their animals .
But sometimes , we would have to take a medical community , especially for some <unk> training , especially for some <unk> , <unk> community .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the brain <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and doctors in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the bag that &apos;s going to send me his heart .
And this procedure , which is , we &apos;ve been able to <unk> in many humans , was <unk> , with the exception of that <unk> and that glue .
It &apos;s <unk> symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients ; it &apos;s not the same thing that we can do , and it &apos;s not the same thing that we can do with their animals , for their animals , to their animals .
And when I once was in the same day , last year was a sophomore in UCLA Medical Center and in the <unk> of Los Angeles .
And I started looking at a thing , and I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I was , I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I think , I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I think , I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I think , clearly , clearly , one thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I
The doctors and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the same diseases in their patients , basically , doctors and <unk> <unk> the same diseases in their patients and animals , and they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Well , I have to have a <unk> .
But I think I &apos;ve studied physiology compared to evolutionary biology and evolutionary biology during the university — I really did my Cambridge thesis on the <unk> of Darwin — learning more about the significant disease between the animals and human disease was a very necessary touch to me .
And I started asking them how could be , with all of these <unk> , who never would have to hear a view of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> to have another view about one of my patients ?
Do you have never been a <unk> Talk ?
Even more , why should we get ?
Every doctors will have some extra connections that the animals and human beings .
All the drugs we prescribe , we take or we give our families <unk> before in a animal .
But there &apos;s a big difference between giving an animal a drug or a drug disease , and that animal has to take a human disease and that animal damage to themselves , diabetes or chest cancer .
Maybe part of the surprise is the growing seasons that our world does about between the urban and the <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about these kids who think the rising rise in the trees , or the cheese comes from a plant .
The human hospitals in today are going to be increasingly <unk> more in <unk> departments .
And this creates a <unk> device between humans that are in the world are treated and the animal patients who live in the oceans in the <unk> and in the jungles .
But I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I
doctors and scientists would have been paid for our species , Homo erectus , and scientists were used to pay for our species , Homo sapiens , it &apos;s just a lot more likely to be special than any other .
But in our underwear we don &apos;t end up to <unk> .
I was asking myself when I was to hear the Mozart or I see my <unk> the photos that caused Mars .
I &apos;m sorry that called the human <unk> , even <unk> the cost scientifically <unk> of <unk> as a higher part of the time .
Well , but this <unk> I &apos;m <unk> .
Now , when I look at a human patient , I always ask me , what I know how many animals about this problem I don &apos;t know ?
And more , I could better care to my human patient if you &apos;re going to get better to my human patient if you &apos;re going to <unk> how a human animal is ?
And I &apos;ve got some examples from the connections that I took me to this kind of <unk> .
<unk> heart <unk> .
Allah year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , found &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , to be <unk> , and in the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , to them , to have a <unk> , to have them to have them to have them , Allah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> by the year 2000 , and the year 2000 , the <unk> of
It was described in a father &apos;s father &apos;s game for a game that &apos;s going to have lost the whole life of life in an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it turns out that this &quot; &quot; new diagnosis is not new yet yet .
The <unk> could also be able to <unk> , trying to figure out how to <unk> symptoms <unk> in animals , from the same decade from 1970 , from the decade of 1970 .
How many human lives could be asked if this knowledge was to the risk of the emergency doctors and the <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some human patients are going to be themselves .
You know , <unk> .
Some of the animals also are also themselves in themselves .
There are <unk> that we would have to take off the way and again to <unk> .
But the <unk> are very specific shapes and it &apos;s been able to treat and even prevent the <unk> in the animals that are going to be like this .
Wouldn &apos;t it be this knowledge to help us to pay for the <unk> , of the parents and the patients who are fighting their own ?
They were <unk> and psychosis .
Sometimes , as a little bit of giving birth a few women would lead to depression , sometimes in depression , and even in the <unk> states .
You can introduce to his own son , and in cases it got to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> knows also that when instead a little bit <unk> , little after the bone , it can propel their <unk> , and they were <unk> in some cases , and some cases would be crushed to us .
But the <unk> <unk> is a treatment to address this <unk> syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin of <unk> .
Oxytocin is the hormone of <unk> , and it causes <unk> has a burden interest in its <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be that information at the risk of <unk> and <unk> , from the family doctors and the patients who are faced by the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> ?
And despite the fact that it &apos;s all this , the distance between our opened is a big .
To <unk> , a lot of me I &apos;m going to have to put some of it in the evidence .
There are doctors who can be <unk> with the professionals who are not <unk> in medicine .
I mean , the dentists , <unk> and psychologists , but especially at the <unk> .
Of course , most doctors have no idea that it &apos;s harder to get out of today in a <unk> <unk> than a medical worker , and when we go to medicine learned everything you &apos;re relevant to know about a species , Homo sapiens . But the <unk> must learn about health and the <unk> disease , we &apos;re going to <unk> , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame to the <unk> by <unk> <unk> with <unk> and ignorance of my profession .
So here &apos;s a joke from the <unk> of <unk> : How do you call a <unk> that you just know ?
Doctor <unk> this device became in my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through the programs like Darwin &apos;s <unk> on <unk> , in the <unk> in the <unk> of the specialists in the animals and the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> our own home and residents .
And through the Hebrew Conference , where we were taking a medical system and <unk> to remain rapid debates about the diseases and the disorders of human patients and animals .
In the Hebrew Conference of subjects like a treatment of a chest cancer , a chest cancer in a <unk> <unk> can help us better , a child &apos;s computer education school ; how to understand the <unk> of a <unk> cow — how to understand the <unk> of a <unk> cow , and how to understand better the treatment of the time of the separation of the time .
In the Hebrew Conference , first in America , and now around the world , doctors and now the world , doctors and <unk> leave their <unk> and <unk> them as a child , as a doctors .
For the end , humans are also animal , and it &apos;s already time that we , doctors , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> in a <unk> health care that we &apos;ve made all of the species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and most <unk> medicine are being <unk> by the doctors who are working with the doctors who are not humans .
And one of the best ways of designing the human patient is <unk> very carefully , as all other patients in the planet &apos;s living planet , they grow and they were <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; . <unk> !
( Applause ) To <unk> brain <unk> , as you can imagine , it was , as you can imagine , because you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because
I didn &apos;t know about the <unk> .
In cultures , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , in cultures in the world , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you
Life , a complex human being complex , is replaced by data , the <unk> , the medical results , the results of the lab , the list of medicine ...
Suddenly it would have been a disease with legs .
The doctors start talking to a language that you don &apos;t get to .
You &apos;ll make your head your body and your body your body and your <unk> .
People starts to change too much because they &apos;re starting to treat the disease instead of the person .
<unk> : What do you say , what would you say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; We even say &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As so much , I would say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as I say , I would love to ask anyone to have answer .
Do you remember the guy who &apos;s — you &apos;re who you work with <unk> ?
Am I who study ? How do love ? &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m a creative ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What I did to do this to do this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; I can change something in my life style ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : there &apos;s something that can do it ?
Is there any other choice ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the good types in all cases , because they &apos;re very expressive and engaged with <unk> .
But they also are very used to treating patients , so I would say that sometimes lost the way to the point of you is an torture and you &apos;re an torture and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , and you &apos;re like <unk> , literally in a patient .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is that we &apos;re going to take away from any way to know your situation , to make it better to your family and friends or in order to create some way of changing your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going on .
But with all , you &apos;ll get to take the track in your hands of a very high booth .
Whereas I was in the hospital , I asked them to tell me that I was interviewing me from my <unk> <unk> <unk> that I was interviewing me to read my <unk> from my <unk> <unk> <unk> that I was in the hospital , asked me to him , I asked him to him and I &apos;d ask me to him at the hospital , I asked him to him and I &apos;d ask me to him at the hospital , I asked him to him and I &apos;d asked me to him , I &apos;d ask me to
It was very hard to do , because it &apos;s not very much to ask a picture of your own <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we don &apos;t know me .
I &apos;m more like this .
The cure , is what it is , has to deal with all my own . &quot; &quot; So the next cure was the most , &quot; &quot; So the answer , is what I would like to do in the hospital , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
I was decided to change my relationship with the <unk> and I was decided to learn more about him before I do something as a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , use many kinds of technologies to open and open information in my work .
So my great bet was spreading all the data , getting the data , and do it in such a way that any could be able to be able to be able to do it .
So I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; — I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; — I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; — I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; — I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; — I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; — I created a web site called &quot; &quot;
As I had to take it , but that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk to you , but that &apos;s actually going to talk to another talk .
( Laughter ) So we would ask this word , &quot; &quot; La <unk> , &quot; &quot; because in Italian means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; can have many meanings .
In our secular culture means to eradicate or make a scale to disease , but in other cultures as for example of Asia , from the Mediterranean , the West Bank , or Africa , can represent many other things .
So of course I interested in the opinion of medical medical and the rest of the health care , but also me interested in the <unk> proposal for an artist , by the poet , by the <unk> , or , why not , by musicians .
It was <unk> social <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And it worked .
The site La <unk> would come around the world .
It was very much fun to me from Italy and the <unk> and the days of <unk> people in very little days of emails through emails , social media — most of the most <unk> were counseling of how to do my own <unk> , but many more they were intrigued of how to do it as I was .
For example , <unk> thousands of videos , images , photos and figments <unk> to La <unk> .
We have here , of Francesca <unk> and his <unk> .
Or what did the artist Patrick <unk> : You add a sculpture in 3D of my tumor and <unk> it into <unk> .
Now you can have my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something that you can share the same <unk> .
And this was what was happening in the scientific , scientific , global medicine in traditional disciplines , various researchers , all of the researchers , all they were connected to me .
Given this information , and support , I was able to collect a team of neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , <unk> and many hundreds of <unk> with the ones I could talk about information about information that would be responsible , which is very important .
We &apos;ve got to formulate an strategy from my own own <unk> in different languages and across different cultures .
So the current strategy would take the entire world and thousands of years of human history , I think I find a lot of a sense .
&#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93;
So I could take my time to be a lot .
I was going to take the doctor with my doctor who wanted to work , I would run the hospital when I wanted to be , and all while thousands of people were comfortable with me .
All the world felt that could be <unk> <unk> , and this was the most important part of La <unk> .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) <unk> bad news : I have — wow , I &apos;m — it &apos;s a very low <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s not too much .
I was totally my life and my lifestyle life .
It was very intense , I was very intense , I was very intense , I was a net in the electrodes of this side , to build a functional map of what the brain is controlling .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the doctor to understand the risks I was going to run and if there was some of some of me like I &apos;d like to avoid .
Obviously , it &apos;s <unk> .
This whole key was the very very popular La <unk> .
We &apos;re going to teach them to help their stories , their stories .
The doctors came to talk to people who usually don &apos;t have to be asked when it &apos;s about <unk> .
I was going to tell me , I &apos;m a still accurate state of translation , between many different languages , where the science is shown with emotion and the modern research .
&#91; <unk> &#93; The key point of La <unk> was <unk> part of a truly committed to a truly committed and connected to the global well-being of each of their individuals .
This global <unk> is my <unk> code for <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I can &apos;t say , what &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know that there was to be a song before .
So I think I &apos;ll start with what I &apos;m going to start with .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before I was nothing , I was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , ( Applause ) I &apos;ll take Travis on the ground . ( Applause )
<unk> , like we call it , is an incredible space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that makes sacred <unk> is that we don &apos;t give us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
It &apos;s very much alive now .
There are so many decisions when you go to <unk> .
We didn &apos;t have any idea what we were coming .
So one of us did a interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; But that could happen to happen or not .
All listening . We respond .
There &apos;s not time for the ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s more easy to talk about someone else &apos;s error .
So the way I was making a mistake when I &apos;m in the <unk> — before I &apos;m in the <unk> — I don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake we would have is not who to understand that &apos;s what another did is .
Every &quot; &quot; error is &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
And even though it &apos;s hard to describe what it would be a fun .
For example , if I &apos;m painting a color , like if I &apos;m playing with the palette , you &apos;ll be sonar like this ...
( Music ) If Christian rings , I like to <unk> — ( Music ) ( Music ) If Christian rings .
You see , it &apos;s all fits in the forest palette .
If it comes to light .
You see , all of it in the interior of this nuclear revolution that we &apos;re painting .
But if you touch <unk> <unk> , most of ears will get a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this palette .
At the moment , Christian summer was add to this .
And we &apos;re not going to get the name .
I &apos;d love to play for a second and then I &apos;ll be able to stop and talk to you a moment .
So let &apos;s see that &apos;s what happens when we touch this palette .
( Music ) ( Music ) <unk> , somebody could be <unk> as a mistake .
I just would just say it &apos;s a mistake that &apos;s not going to be wrong .
An lost chance .
So it &apos;s <unk> . We &apos;re going to paint this palette again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we go to the name , but something will switch .
We &apos;re going to embrace your ideas , or not .
( Music ) You see , she touched his bill .
And I created a melody .
This time changed the texture .
It was a little more rhythmic , a little more intense , very much more intense .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is , if you don &apos;t think , if every musician is not conscious , and not to be aware of their partners to identify the idea and we won &apos;t allow creativity .
This <unk> is really incredible .
It &apos;s an <unk> experience .
And I know why I &apos;m talking about all when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that to be able to climb into the <unk> and to make music is a blessing .
What do you have to do this with finance ?
We all are <unk> musicians , our <unk> is not the most far beyond the finance .
( Laughter ) I just wanted to show you how the wires are .
And the other thing is that we don &apos;t have <unk> in jazz .
There are people who do it .
But it &apos;s accurate the odds .
If you &apos;re going to get it up to the band that you &apos;re going to do it so I want to take it up , and I say to go on — ...
Come on , I &apos;m going to show you something .
One , two , two , three , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit chaotic because I &apos;m going to give me the ideas .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> by this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music , the best I can do is to listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more than seeing what I can tell about what I can do .
If I want the music to take a certain level of <unk> , the first step for me is being patient , listening to what happens and collect something else what happens to me .
When you do it , you would <unk> and <unk> the other musicians and they &apos;re going to get more , and so that &apos;s going to do it .
Look , one , two , two , two , three , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s something totally different when I shot my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more <unk> .
It &apos;s not about to get my vision to me .
It is about to be at the moment , we &apos;re getting to each other and let it make creativity .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to be sincere , so these incredible talks and ideas are being exposed to , <unk> on the position of it , and it was going to tell you about the television .
All the world sees the television .
We have to take it . They &apos;ll take some other aspects .
This in America are people in it .
The media is a <unk> , a <unk> , almost five hours of day .
Well ?
I put myself on the television , so I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
But the many people don &apos;t like .
They did it , they <unk> .
<unk> that it &apos;s useless , and things worse , it &apos;s <unk> .
My mother , when I was a girl , I was a girl , &quot; &quot; The <unk> box . &quot; &quot; My intention is not <unk> if there &apos;s the good television or the television — my idea today is to tell you that the television has consciousness .
If I think the television is consciousness is because I think that the television of it directly directly , and social , emotionally <unk> in our nation — television and emotional <unk> in our nation — television is how we &apos;re all related to our values .
All of that is intrinsic to humans and we will be able to adapt to our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good or bad television .
We talk about <unk> television .
We talk about 10 programs with the greatest audience for a <unk> period for a <unk> period .
As that distinction reflects not only what you &apos;ve been to have , which is the idea of our social social social social social social and collective collective , if we don &apos;t , how many of these programs have been able to have the idea of our social consciousness ?
As we &apos;re focusing on television over time , and what tells us to do this to our society ?
It &apos;s going to be the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , if it &apos;s <unk> that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four primary primary instincts .
<unk> , relationships , power , and the desire of <unk> .
As humans , what you &apos;ve reminded you is that we &apos;re going to get us up with the time until we were able to use these basic animal instincts .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel fear , compassion .
This is not the case in the animal kingdom .
The other thing we &apos;ve described human beings is we love the entertainment .
You see the television .
This is something that we &apos;re clearly in the animal &apos;s clearly in the animal world .
In animals , you can just play it , but you don &apos;t know how to look at it .
So I &apos;m aiming to discover what understands from this relationship of human beings among the television programs and human consciousness .
Why the hell evolved this is ?
The kid said , &quot; &quot; I would love like the hell of the y-axis and the <unk> sitting in our shoulder .
<unk> works like our consciousness , we would have <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
To try to challenge these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
<unk> 50 years to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s called <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the audience that was 100 years ago — thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people almost almost <unk> — about 18 and 70 years , and we would have been <unk> as if we were emotionally emotionally .
How did you tell you about a single one of these programs ?
Do you want a moral moral ?
Did you get <unk> ? <unk> ?
What &apos;s meant for you ?
For our TED TED audience , I mean that this would spread the cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotional , is universal .
And second , an 80 percent of the most popular programs of the U.S. <unk> at the rest of the world .
I wish we can tell our audience <unk> if I &apos;m going to <unk> .
I want to give you the two people before I went to the first slide : Why <unk> inspired me to think of the idea of consciousness and the <unk> that consciousness can be <unk> in the day day , and Jack Stern .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to give you the data to show you why Hans Rosling , who you &apos;d like to see .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
Here , since 1960 , since 1960 , the 50 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things we &apos;re going to start with the state of inspiration and the state of moral <unk> , which is to define the story as the television shows that they &apos;re going to make me better with the television that are going to make me better with the world .
<unk> moral <unk> are the programs that don &apos;t make the difference between good and bad .
At principle , you see that in 1960 the 1960 <unk> <unk> .
So we see the television .
<unk> moral <unk> starts to mobilize .
I &apos;m going to end up the back of 60 , <unk> moral <unk> , and the low <unk> .
Why ?
The crisis of the Cuba , the <unk> and <unk> , the movement by the <unk> , shared cosmology , the Vietnam War , the <unk> of the Vietnam Ice Fund , the <unk> of the <unk> of King and Bobby <unk> , the <unk> scandal .
Look what happens .
1970 the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> moral <unk> .
<unk> , more Ronald Reagan , a television president , is in control .
It was going to get the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t say , the <unk> , the <unk> , Chernobyl , Chernobyl .
<unk> moral <unk> becomes the dominant tendency for 1990 to 20 years .
You &apos;ll just look at this .
This graph is just a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the happiness <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in blue and green .
At that time , we have &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and national programs that <unk> happiness .
It will increase . The happiness will <unk> all .
<unk> starts to rise .
<unk> the social methodology increases .
We have come up to 1969 and look what happens .
The happiness , the <unk> and the social comment , not only are they in our society , but there &apos;s no two programs , and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk>
What was the number one ?
The very few <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> and Martin &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
We all were going to be working together .
The secular <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s see this green peak in <unk> with a second of trends .
When I was going to ask the term , successful no precedent , which means ?
I mean , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> came from <unk> .
This was the first program that I was saying to say , &quot; &quot; my god , I can comment on what I think of the Vietnam War , about the president , through the television &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? That &apos;s what means a successful problem .
Well , the same thing in the last graph look what happens .
1970 , <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television by entertainment .
The social comment and <unk> <unk> over 70 .
Now look at this .
How would you negotiate the 70 ? Norman Lear .
We have &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the main program in the technologies 10 to the next decade of the 70 — <unk> .
In the 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs have been <unk> back during the Cold War , five of the <unk> <unk> .
Only a generation , 20 years , and we &apos;ve found , okay , <unk> !
Could you feel that ?
Can you get it ?
The audience so I knew , I want to tell the people of the digital people won &apos;t have the problems .
Archie Bunker was pushed out of his <unk> with the rest of us , and Archie Bunker was pushed away from his <unk> with the rest of us .
This is another chart , and by other <unk> , <unk> other <unk> : <unk> and imagination , which are now planning as well as a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a statistic of the <unk> , the saying it &apos;s an statistic of the <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;ll tell you that every time you get <unk> and imagination , it matches a <unk> of the stop .
We want to see programs about people saving money and stop ?
We don &apos;t . In the 70s we have the current <unk> <unk> that if you were able to get the <unk> samples in 1973 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six billion dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Great Book . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s — another peak of the 1980s — another peak of a <unk> , another peak of programs about control and power .
What was the programs in the programs ?
They were <unk> and rich .
&quot; &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> Island . &quot;
A <unk> shows from our national psyche , with rapid and tough , the stop .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
I was told or not in my <unk> , secure ones that have been hearing or <unk> about the fall of the <unk> and the <unk> .
As you say this <unk> , the slope of the place .
The chicken , the decade of humor , <unk> like &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; All right , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the course of the humor , the decade of humor , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot;
But look like the slope , the slope .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , the reverse of the judgment .
Why don &apos;t you ?
We had the presidential 2000s of 2,000 of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the technological <unk> .
The third of September .
The <unk> <unk> in part of the social diversity .
It turns out what happens with time .
In the change , the Internet is <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
What do people in your condom ?
I would argue that we were <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> happiness , my world are down below .
Don &apos;t , they want to judge our judge .
I can get it out of the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin dance .
I can spend the new <unk> . You &apos;re <unk> .
Great , yeah ?
It turns out to radically different things that are these programs , pure entertainment , two there , there &apos;s the one that I said at the beginning of the beginning ? You &apos;ll get a basics .
We are animals , we need our own .
There was no second in television without a <unk> and absolute mother .
In the decade of the <unk> : June <unk> in the <unk> program , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of social consciousness .
<unk> <unk> , the archetype of the <unk> <unk> , who talked about abortion , <unk> , even the <unk> on the television .
In the 1980s , it &apos;s the first <unk> way to Alexis <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Video ) <unk> Brown <unk> with a <unk> when I had a thought of being a single mother .
The mother of this was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was ,
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a demo or a reminder of it in our consciousness , sitting in our attitudes , what I know is I &apos;ve been doing this picture .
So all of us , women and men from <unk> , the audience of <unk> , thank you by <unk> to my idea of television .
But also let me give you the <unk> to the <unk> that would take me from the morning to get their ideas in our fingertips in the ages of these days .
Dan your life , insurance , but you &apos;re worried how to allow it to the collective social social awareness of collective social social awareness , longevity or not .
So thank you so much .

In 1994 , I went into a prison in <unk> and I met a child from 12 years that he gave me and to tell her to one lawyer .
And by the <unk> to the eyes of my eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that had written to farmers , never to see any letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t a eight-year-old that made something important to someone .
It wasn &apos;t a political player .
It was a child from 12 years old that had a bicycle .
What I also realized was that it wasn &apos;t just that it wasn &apos;t just in <unk> , but that &apos;s not just <unk> , but that &apos;s the developing world in the developing world that we &apos;ve been <unk> , 93 of these countries made laws that have the right to one lawyer .
And I realized that there were an incredible <unk> of opportunities for all of us as a global community for all of us as global global , and we &apos;ve finally managed to deny the torture of research that we &apos;re working on and then we can finally deny the torture of research .
So often we think about torture as a form of political torture or a political torture or it &apos;s reserved for only the worst but in fact , 95 percent of the <unk> today are not to work in political .
They are for people who are in the <unk> systems of <unk> and by unfortunately , they have the torture &apos;s way the most cheaper way of research that &apos;s cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper than having a lawyer or access to the assistance of the assistance that &apos;s most of the time .
The day of today we &apos;ve seen that we are possible to ourselves as a global community , if we take that decision , we &apos;ll take it and end up the torture , and then the torture is the ethic as a research method for our lives , but this is the <unk> of three things .
First comes the ability , the power of power and connection needs the world &apos;s scale .
The second is to make sure there &apos;s a little bit <unk> and systematic the victims .
And the third is the commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started <unk> , and if you were <unk> ?
Could we do something about these about 93 countries ?
And I founded <unk> &apos;s to <unk> that has been as specific to the specific quest of the ending with the torture method of research and put in practice the <unk> rights in these caves , and they were sending them into a early phase in <unk> and courts .
However , my first experiences came from <unk> and the <unk> of my first visit to <unk> , when there was , in 1994 , even less than 10 of the country in the country because the <unk> <unk> <unk> all .
And even 20 years later , so it was only 10 lawyers in the country and so forth , by the way , in a prison , not only <unk> a 13-year-old boy , but you &apos;re going to <unk> with women too , and the <unk> &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ll take here from 10 times 10 years because my husband committed a little <unk> but you can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a place where they didn &apos;t
The first group of <unk> <unk> and still remember , while I asked me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do to research ? &quot; &quot; &#93; .
And the room was going to take silence and finally a woman called &quot; &quot; name <unk> , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; The teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been more than a lot of people and I &apos;ve ever imagined that &quot; &quot; professor . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been more than a lot of people and I &apos;ve ever imagined that &apos;s because all of the fact that we &apos;re all more of the
And these teachers had to be <unk> to decide that they would take to defend themselves and <unk> them between them so that they can put into practice these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where some of the <unk> came up , the top of it and the rest behind me , and they were <unk> as the same as the <unk> , and they were <unk> , whereas the <unk> left , I said , &quot; &quot; No , not , we &apos;re going to do things the same way in the same way in which you have done to the way . &quot; &quot; But one day , the perfect case .
She said that it actually looked like the person to get to the person to get to the <unk> and I believe that I would have a lot of it in a question , but the police came up , and she didn &apos;t have nothing to it .
So then she was <unk> . She had <unk> emails .
And when he took his case to a judge , for the first time this <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for the <unk> and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for the <unk> and so it will be washed away in freedom . &quot; &quot; And the judge started taking cases a way to change the course of the story of <unk> .
But it &apos;s not true .
And I used to think , then it &apos;s just going to <unk> ?
Or also happens in other countries ?
But there &apos;s so many countries — there &apos;s so many countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s a lot of countries — there &apos;s
In Burundi , I went into a prison and there was no eight-year-old , but a child &apos;s eight-year-old that would take a cell phone .
Or a woman , I sat in arms on his baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it was not a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here by she , but I &apos;m not here by <unk> two <unk> and a iron in his baby and still the way that I was in prison .
And when I went through the letter from prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> it in freedom .
A judge will get rid of the free . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can <unk> , but look at my prison , and the 80 percent of the two thousands of people here are not lawyers . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers had the <unk> to organize a system where they could take the cases .
And we realized that not only was the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that we have to take the difference .
For example , in <unk> , what happened was that &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; it wasn &apos;t true but he had the 24 member of her who had been <unk> . And the same way , in China , always me who is like a cool wind in the Thar Desert when we can <unk> . &quot; &quot; Or in <unk> , where the world had , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot;
And I heard , &quot; &quot; I heard you that we can &apos;t help to create fairness , we don &apos;t have to fight our efforts , we don &apos;t need the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want to tell you that the lack of resources never was <unk> to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And with this organized organized the red carpet that you can reach the cases of systematic , the random frequency that you can reach the cases of systematic .
So , the solution we found was the ability and then the solution , the access to it .
I was recently in <unk> and I decided to <unk> with another group of lawyers . What was me was they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have the streets . The police is one of the main reasons we had the revolution . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here we &apos;ve been taking tens of millions of dollars in a lot of a few hours in the development of the <unk> system .
What &apos;s going to happen then ? &quot; &quot; <unk> with one of the development agencies and they were forming a tax and <unk> hole , which turns out to be the normal molecule , instead of the <unk> .
It &apos;s also a manual <unk> manual <unk> manual <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> . &quot; &quot; They all got it up . The lawyers can come to the police station .
<unk> are perfectly trained .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before we all went to the valuation of the valuation , which would happen to them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And by the very very small pieces are not just the whole background of lawyers , but they have to find a way to go to the circle of the lawyers , because they are the guarantee in the system for people who are being tortured .
And while I &apos;m saying this , they &apos;re also conscious , that sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , seems like if you could do it , but you &apos;re going to do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it seems like a huge thing .
And they &apos;re a lot of the reasons why I think we &apos;re possible .
The first one is that people about the Taliban in the California are way to create miracles through your commitment .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> , who I spoke to you , but also , but also , it also advocates around the world that are looking at the key pieces .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people who were <unk> and who wanted to help , but how could we get them ?
So so much is a competition in line where you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to win a <unk> idea of making fairness .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> around the world , from Sri Lankan to <unk> or <unk> or the Democratic Republic of Congo , who had five billion dollars made of an unbelievable thing , through SMS , through SMS , and whatever the case .
And there &apos;s not only these <unk> , but there are also people who are going to be able to tell what they are their contacts and how they can move them together .
For example , in China &apos;s <unk> laws that were expected to be abused people who were punished .
And while I was sitting in this one of our lawyers lawyers , I said , &quot; &quot; What can we do ? How can we do it ? How can we make it ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s still a way . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s still a way . &quot; &quot; And the 4 October raised in three billion members of the Union &apos;s <unk> , of the <unk> school members of the U.S. State of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> came to the police and found a second legal and <unk> revolution .
I &apos;ve talked about the fact that we need to form and support the capacity .
We need to go out of practice in the <unk> way to change the way to care .
But the third and last point , the most important thing is that we &apos;re facing with this .
And usually the people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well , but it &apos;s too idealistic .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same opinion that we had to get to the people who were expected to end the slavery thing to be expected to be the slavery .
It started with a small group of people who decided to <unk> .
One of our favorite poems of the teachers , who they share with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re worth value , friends , the way it &apos;s going to be long , the route never is clear , and there &apos;s a lot of hard , and there &apos;s a lot of hard , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of it , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not going to be safe as a research community , and there &apos;s a lot
And I &apos;ve always wondered , because I know the question will be that , and it will be a pleasure to talk to you for you , &quot; But what can I do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m first sure you can do it . &quot; &quot; Well , secondly , I &apos;m sure you can do it . And secondly , we &apos;ve been able to figure out what you can do . And secondly , we would have to set out the story of <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> was a three-year-old child when I met him in a <unk> prison in the <unk> <unk> , but as I was in prison , they all had a lot of <unk> , even the <unk> , so I was the only one that could come and go out between the <unk> .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s <unk> . And for the time we were able to get to grow , which is what it is also grows ?
What was it was going to happen for the first <unk> , and the second and then the third and then , very soon , it &apos;s a head of head to be able to <unk> through and <unk> it , and then we would run the third to the first one . And he would put his finger , because what he wanted to do was to go to me .
So of course , I never had to visit the whole world every day , but he &apos;s trying to visit all IKEA bothered . And by the <unk> , he was going to visit his fingers through .
Or if the cells were dark , it was like iron <unk> and it would become their fingers through .
And most of the <unk> <unk> that was his biggest <unk> and his sun and the sun and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and I thought , here &apos;s a <unk> .
Born in a prison without nothing , without anything , without a sense of his own <unk> , who in my opinion all of your own dreams , who in my opinion are going to be a little bit of one . And I told me , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t help do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I will do the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I would argue by having the imagination to have the imagination to imagine the training of a new world with all of us together and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Be a Talk on a red red . &quot;
If a story of my childhood is referred to a story of a childhood .
&quot; &quot; <unk> a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; <unk> with me with a inspirational call called action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not like that you think of a TED .
In fact , if we were going to be too much more these mechanisms , we would have a <unk> or a emotional <unk> .
But there &apos;s one thing that all the TED Talks are in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because I &apos;m going to share with you , because I &apos;m going to talk to you , I hear my life , because I &apos;m going to talk to you about a lot of great TED Talks , like these .
I would argue with your talk of the audience , and I learned directly directly from the secrets of a great Talk .
And yet these <unk> and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common ingredient .
And this is the thing : The main task as <unk> is to transfer the mind of who you hear an remarkable gift , an unusual and beautiful object that we call a sense .
Let me <unk> .
Here &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s about to give a TED Talk , and , frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> Van <unk> !
( Applause ) ( Applause ) So one of the most important things I never would never see before feel that your brains are going to be able to get their brains to <unk> and between themselves .
They &apos;re literally beginning to <unk> the same same pattern in brain patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they are to make the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to make a look at the brain by taking a moment .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look at here , right here , a few billion are wired between each one that represents a very nice idea .
within the whole audience , inside the audience &apos;s mind inside the audience .
It &apos;s like this ; it just a couple of minutes , a pattern that involves millions of neurons to one 200 , just with that 200 , and look at a face and look at a face .
But <unk> , which is an idea ?
Well , you can actually <unk> as a pattern of information that helps understanding and navigate the world .
The ideas came from many ways and <unk> , from the complex and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> by the very simple and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the ideas came from many ways and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
So here &apos;s a couple of examples from this time since TED stage .
Ken Robinson Robinson <unk> creativity is the key of our future of our kids .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : What is the creativity that the creativity now is , and we have <unk> with the same status .
Chris Anderson : <unk> Hardy <unk> with <unk> is beautiful .
( Video ) <unk> 4 : <unk> around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , resists <unk> .
CA : <unk> grants to people is more than a simple identity .
Video : <unk> : <unk> story : <unk> , and the problem with stereotypes is not that it &apos;s fake , it &apos;s untrue .
CA : Your mind makes ideas , and not the randomly troll .
They &apos;re worried related to us .
It turns out , make an incredible structure that &apos;s a complex structure that &apos;s your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like <unk> across the world .
And it &apos;s <unk> from millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a small component of your world &apos;s view is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is going to be <unk> , then the green is going to be the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the
But if another component of your world &apos;s view is the idea that leopards is dangerous , then the green are actually dangerous way .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your vision of the world are crucial .
It turns out that the most salient thing that is the most insidious thing that is possible , a cholesterol to the <unk> , but wonderful world of the outside .
Now , the different visions of the world &apos;s everyday can be very different .
For example , how responds your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a
Or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; a terrorist .
CA : Whatever it is the answer , there &apos;s millions of people there that are very different .
If you &apos;re going to be a second , you &apos;re able to change , forever , the way you see the world and transform their actions so much now like the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that we would have to <unk> the human culture .
So if you think about your main task as it is to build a sense of your audiences in your audiences , there &apos;s four <unk> to address that task : First , you &apos;re going to ask your talk to one idea .
The ideas are complex things ; we need to reduce the content to be able to get rid of the simple idea that more of you , and having the chance to do it well .
You have to give context , share examples , to try to be curious .
So I would have a thought of a sense , and it &apos;s a thread that &apos;s going to make a thread that will take all your talk , so that everything that we would have <unk> in a way .
And secondly , I &apos;m going to tell you a reason for you to do something reason to do .
Before we start to build things in your audiences of your audiences , you have to have their permission to get it .
And what is the tool to do ?
Curiosity .
It &apos;s going to give you your audience curiosity .
We ask questions <unk> , <unk> questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t have meaning and accurate .
If you can reveal a <unk> on the world of someone &apos;s view , you &apos;ll take a need to meet that gap of knowledge .
And when I was saying that wish is much easier to start to build the idea .
Third , you &apos;ll get a piece of a piece of storytelling from the concepts that your audience knows .

The streets have names , the apples they are only <unk> without the name between the streets . &quot; &quot; The <unk> march , a little bit <unk> and <unk> .
Now , imagine you &apos;re a parking ticket street , you &apos;ll tell you the person you have to do and ask questions , &quot; &quot; <unk> , how did this list ?
They <unk> , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the apple apple and that the 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this little girl ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
