( Arabic ) <unk> in Allah , <unk> , <unk> .
( <unk> ) <unk> in a family class .
My father was five years when she lost his father , but when I was <unk> , he was already a business man .
If their children were children or girls , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children , they were children
So I suppose I was <unk> .
My mother was <unk> 16 times .
Of the 16 <unk> , we &apos;re alive five .
You can imagine why I had to pass when I was a kid .
<unk> , there were women being transported to <unk> , or children being brought to a <unk> .
At that moment , when I graduated from high school , I &apos;m really going to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I would argue my education , more <unk> to the university .
<unk> , in my country , there was no women in the <unk> , which still was in the medical school , I couldn &apos;t go .
As a result , my father would <unk> America .
I watched in America .
I just just talked about my studies .
Whereas I was interviewing my education , Russia <unk> my country .
You know , when I was walking my training , I would argue what I was happening to my family and my country .
<unk> months , and I had no news .
My family would have been in a <unk> field .
So instead I finished studying the studies , I would tell my family .
I wanted to get safe .
But where I was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Every day , when I was interested in the news , when it was still the <unk> in my country , it would be the heart .
I would go back to my country , but at the same time , I knew I couldn &apos;t go to me because there was no place to me .
I had a good job .
It was <unk> in a university .
It was okay .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
They were living with them .
So it wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to tell my home .
So we would have to go to the field of <unk> .
And when I arrived at the <unk> field of <unk> , there was seven million and a half of <unk> . Seven million and a half of <unk> .
<unk> , black &apos; 90s were women and children , and Americans , or they were in the war , or they were in it , and they know what ?
When he was doing the <unk> , I was doing things that didn &apos;t get away .
I watched a widow with five and eight children , and I sit there , and I don &apos;t know what to do .
I watched a new woman who had no idea where to go , without the schools , or not a place in the living in the living .
I watched kids who have lost their parents , their <unk> and a 15-year-old , a sweet , and a sweet , she had to take away their families , be the head of family and try to protect their siblings , their moms and children .
The situation was absolutely <unk> .
My heart <unk> by my people and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
In that moment , it &apos;s a impulse .
In that moment , I felt like , I &apos;m like , I can do for these people ?
How can I get <unk> ?
I &apos;m a single person , I can do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew my education was going to be my life .
It was <unk> . It &apos;s going to take a position .
They put trust . They &apos;ll give a career .
He took the underground back to my family , to take my family to another country , so they were safe .
And at the point I knew that what was meant to my people was education and health and that was what we could get .
But think , you think it was easy ?
Because not , because of that , women didn &apos;t have access to education .
Furthermore , after the <unk> in Afghanistan , people don &apos;t have no longer <unk> .
It was very hard to get and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who are I ?
Anybody who comes from the United States .
Some of you who have been here .
I would ask me to me ? &quot; &quot; So of course , I &apos;m not .
So what really did was he offered to make trust this community .
How do I do it ?
I went to <unk> , I watched and I watched .
I &apos;ve done questions .
I found that I found a man .
I had 80 years .
It was a <unk> .
I went to his tent in the <unk> and <unk> the proposal , &quot; I want to take a teacher . &quot;
And I would say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; as you think I can be professor ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll do you , I can &apos;t be professor ? &quot; &quot; And I finally said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll do you , and instead I started with a guy in his <unk> , I was finally on a class in his <unk> , <unk> his voice .
In a year , we had 25 million deaths , 15,000 children go to school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
So of course , we were doing our work , forming teachers , and they were <unk> in the women of women , human rights , democracy and laws . They found all sorts of action . And one day , you know , it &apos;s going to do our work , forming teachers .
One day I was in the office in <unk> , a day , I was in the office in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a day , I was in the office in <unk> , and one day I was in the office in <unk> , a day in <unk> , <unk> , a day , and a day , I was in the office in <unk> , and one day I was in the office in <unk> , a day in <unk> , <unk> , a day , and a day , I was in the
And suddenly , I saw my personal life was walking the doors and <unk> doors , and suddenly I saw my personal shoulder was to sit down the doors and <unk> , and he was the leader , who do it ?
You know , you know it &apos;s dangerous . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is in play .
But as a leader , you have to keep the <unk> .
You have to keep the <unk> and show a fortress .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; And these people would have been <unk> to my office office .
So the <unk> in the office .
<unk> . Three nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine , nine ,
These were the most <unk> men who can see never .
( Laughter ) People with <unk> <unk> , black clothes , and his mass in the outside of my office .
And I would walk and take a cup .
<unk> . They didn &apos;t go to tea .
And of course , the pitch of voice that was going to be too afraid , and I was really impaired .
But at the same time , I &apos;m going to <unk> .
And of course , at the moment , you see , you see how seen it , 5am your head by a black armband , a black armband , and of course , at the moment , you see how seen it , and of course , at the moment , you see how a seen , standing away from feet to a black armband , and of course , at the moment , you see how a seen , standing away from feet to a black armband , and of course , at the moment , you see
The only thing I saw was the eyes .
<unk> : What do we do ?
&quot; Don &apos;t know that the school would have <unk> women ? &quot;
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; And , they know , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , where the school is ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And he went to me and said , &quot; &quot; So I wanted to tell you , &quot; &quot; â€” I &apos;m sorry , and I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s your house .
You &apos;ll come back some students . We all teach the Koran , the holy book .
You know , the Koran says that if you were to get the holy book that women might be good wives , and they may obey their husbands . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to ask one thing : this is how it &apos;s about that people . ( Laughter ) At that moment , it &apos;s like this people who were going to talk to you .
They were found between them and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ll tell you I would have ever been and got it a <unk> and got a <unk> and <unk> .
So my personal <unk> in mass of my office office .
They were dead .
They didn &apos;t know how to <unk> me .
They didn &apos;t know how they didn &apos;t care about them .
With all of all , we all were <unk> .
All of it , and of course , I was happy to be alive .
( Laughter ) So of course , I was alive .
But also , by getting <unk> during the fall of <unk> , when the <unk> had the power was another story .
They were <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> students , which would have been <unk> by the <unk> .
And so , as they fall out of the <unk> , we went through the country and we open a school after another .
We opened up school centers .
We opened clinics without .
We worked with women and children .
<unk> about health care .
They were <unk> how many kinds of designs can be .
I was very happy . I was <unk> with the result of my work .
And one day , when I was going to spend four and a ski floor , I would run to North Kabul , suddenly , once you would have a more <unk> on the middle of the road , they had 19 kids .
In <unk> back , they &apos;ll take the road .
I would ask my driver &apos;s about me and <unk> , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No , you have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; I put my name and said , &quot; &quot; You know , she &apos;s my name and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll tell you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said nothing and <unk> .
At that moment , women would go into the car .
I &apos;m very impaired and <unk> : &quot; &quot; This is the end . &quot;
This time , I will kill everyone .
She had no doubt .
But yet , when the moment comes , you would have to be the whole way you think about and what you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You &apos;ll see it in your <unk> , and you can follow that .
So I would sit on one side of the car .
My leg would go and walk out of the car .
( Laughter ) <unk> : &quot; &quot; What can I do ? &quot; &quot; You know what I did ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who is .
We know where it goes .
Come on every day of one place .
<unk> women , they &apos;re going to be able to give a job to have a job .
<unk> . What about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What about us ?
What we &apos;re going to do ? &quot; &quot; <unk> and <unk> : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay .
So we know , the only thing we can do , for the time I hear in the time I &apos;d been living , is to get a gun and kill .
We don &apos;t know more . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; And you know what it means .
Obviously , it was a trap .
So I would say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll go and say &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I went on the car , I sat down , and I said to the driver &apos;s <unk> : it &apos;s going back and threw it out to the door .
We just had money to <unk> them , to get them to school , and nothing more .
When I arrived at the office , obviously all the <unk> <unk> .
They would get their houses . Nobody had a foot .
My dorm was the only one I was there and I would <unk> without voice .
I was <unk> , sitting in my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
Because we &apos;ve got education for education .
Hundreds of women said to the <unk> .
So I was sitting there , and suddenly , we &apos;re here talking about pulses , because at the moment , one of my wonderful favorite <unk> would have been <unk> a report .
And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote him .
He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not you . What do you want ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing .
It was equal to me , I didn &apos;t believe , and it was not asking me .
&quot; &quot; Okay , tell you that &apos;s going on . &quot;
It &apos;s going to give all the story .
So he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , for the next , go and get it up and get them .
<unk> . &quot; &quot; And when I was two days later , I did the same way , know how to think , know , they were a little further away , the same kids , there were a little bit further , the same kids , there &apos;s been <unk> and <unk> to stop the car .
So I stopped the car .
I was saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s okay , I &apos;ll go with me . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m going to go with me . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> condition : you know , you know what I say . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
So the next step came to the mosque and to sum up , had it <unk> teachers .
Now , they are the best educators .
<unk> English , learning how to be used , teach computer computer and are my <unk> .
The areas we don &apos;t know in the mountain areas , they come to me . They go ahead and go .
And we <unk> .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s the education to change people .
When we <unk> the people , they change and , in today , we need to work for equality .
You can &apos;t educate women and <unk> men from men , because men are the people who were more difficult for women .
( Laughter ) So we started asking them , because they must be conscious of the women &apos;s potential , knowing how much of the women who are men and who are those women who are themselves in .
So we form men continuously and I think deeply deeply deeply deeply deeply deeply .
I live in a country that live in a country that live in a country that was beautiful .
I want to share this .
It was a beautiful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful and peaceful .
They would take all the parts .
Women &apos;s <unk> education : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> â€” and we went from a house to another .
Don &apos;t <unk> the doors .
But you know , I know it &apos;s happening to my country .
Now , you can &apos;t get out of the security problems .
But we still want Afghanistan before .
And I want to tell you about another part .
Now , women in Afghanistan work very hard , very hard .
They were going to be <unk> . They were <unk> to be <unk> .
They were going to be <unk> , again .
They were going to be <unk> and paste .
So it &apos;s wonderful to see how people are used all of their potential and all of this will happen .
I want to share with you for you for love , by compassion , for trust and by honesty .
If you have these things , you &apos;ll succeed .
We have a poet , <unk> <unk> .
He said , if you have compassion and if you have love , you can make it the world .
And we <unk> , we were .
And if we were to Afghanistan , I &apos;m going to be safe by 100 percent that can make it happen .
Thank you , so many , thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago I got a phone call that changed my life .
So I was <unk> at UCLA , University of California , <unk> <unk> techniques .
I was asked by that was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A old <unk> <unk> <unk> with facial <unk> and <unk> <unk> that was a brain <unk> .
You would remember if you could go to the zoo of the brain , you can see it in the <unk> , and you &apos;ll look at a possible cause of heart cause to search for a possible cause of heart cause to search for a possible cause of heart causes to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for a possible cause of heart disease to search for
We would let it clear that the U.S. <unk> of the United States , and highly <unk> <unk> that care of their own animals are very good for their animals .
But sometimes , we would have to take a medical community , especially for some <unk> training , especially for some <unk> , <unk> community .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the brain <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and doctors in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the bag that &apos;s going to send me his heart .
And this procedure , which is , we &apos;ve been able to <unk> in many humans , was <unk> , with the exception of that <unk> and that glue .
It &apos;s <unk> symptoms , diagnostics and treatments for my human patients ; it &apos;s not the same thing that we can do , and it &apos;s not the same thing that we can do with their animals , for their animals , to their animals .
And when I once was in the same day , last year was a sophomore in UCLA Medical Center and in the <unk> of Los Angeles .
And I started looking at a thing , and I started seeing one thing : &quot; &quot; I was , I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I think , I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I think , I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I think , clearly , clearly , one thing : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just looking at one thing : &quot; &quot; I
The doctors and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the same diseases in their patients , basically , doctors and <unk> <unk> the same diseases in their patients and animals , and they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Well , I have to have a <unk> .
But I think I &apos;ve studied physiology compared to evolutionary biology and evolutionary biology during the university â€” I really did my Cambridge thesis on the <unk> of Darwin â€” learning more about the significant disease between the animals and human disease was a very necessary touch to me .
And I started asking them how could be , with all of these <unk> , who never would have to hear a view of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> to have another view about one of my patients ?
Do you have never been a <unk> Talk ?
Even more , why should we get ?
Every doctors will have some extra connections that the animals and human beings .
All the drugs we prescribe , we take or we give our families <unk> before in a animal .
But there &apos;s a big difference between giving an animal a drug or a drug disease , and that animal has to take a human disease and that animal damage to themselves , diabetes or chest cancer .
Maybe part of the surprise is the growing seasons that our world does about between the urban and the <unk> .
We &apos;re talking about these kids who think the rising rise in the trees , or the cheese comes from a plant .
The human hospitals in today are going to be increasingly <unk> more in <unk> departments .
And this creates a <unk> device between humans that are in the world are treated and the animal patients who live in the oceans in the <unk> and in the jungles .
But I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I think it &apos;s still a deeper reason : I
doctors and scientists would have been paid for our species , Homo erectus , and scientists were used to pay for our species , Homo sapiens , it &apos;s just a lot more likely to be special than any other .
But in our underwear we don &apos;t end up to <unk> .
I was asking myself when I was to hear the Mozart or I see my <unk> the photos that caused Mars .
I &apos;m sorry that called the human <unk> , even <unk> the cost scientifically <unk> of <unk> as a higher part of the time .
Well , but this <unk> I &apos;m <unk> .
Now , when I look at a human patient , I always ask me , what I know how many animals about this problem I don &apos;t know ?
And more , I could better care to my human patient if you &apos;re going to get better to my human patient if you &apos;re going to <unk> how a human animal is ?
And I &apos;ve got some examples from the connections that I took me to this kind of <unk> .
<unk> heart <unk> .
Allah year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , found &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , to be <unk> , and in the year 2000 , the <unk> of humans , the <unk> of humans , to them , to have a <unk> , to have them to have them to have them , Allah , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> by the year 2000 , and the year 2000 , the <unk> of
It was described in a father &apos;s father &apos;s game for a game that &apos;s going to have lost the whole life of life in an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it turns out that this &quot; &quot; new diagnosis is not new yet yet .
The <unk> could also be able to <unk> , trying to figure out how to <unk> symptoms <unk> in animals , from the same decade from 1970 , from the decade of 1970 .
How many human lives could be asked if this knowledge was to the risk of the emergency doctors and the <unk> ?
<unk> .
Some human patients are going to be themselves .
You know , <unk> .
Some of the animals also are also themselves in themselves .
There are <unk> that we would have to take off the way and again to <unk> .
But the <unk> are very specific shapes and it &apos;s been able to treat and even prevent the <unk> in the animals that are going to be like this .
Wouldn &apos;t it be this knowledge to help us to pay for the <unk> , of the parents and the patients who are fighting their own ?
They were <unk> and psychosis .
Sometimes , as a little bit of giving birth a few women would lead to depression , sometimes in depression , and even in the <unk> states .
You can introduce to his own son , and in cases it got to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> knows also that when instead a little bit <unk> , little after the bone , it can propel their <unk> , and they were <unk> in some cases , and some cases would be crushed to us .
But the <unk> <unk> is a treatment to address this <unk> syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin of <unk> .
Oxytocin is the hormone of <unk> , and it causes <unk> has a burden interest in its <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be that information at the risk of <unk> and <unk> , from the family doctors and the patients who are faced by the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> ?
And despite the fact that it &apos;s all this , the distance between our opened is a big .
To <unk> , a lot of me I &apos;m going to have to put some of it in the evidence .
There are doctors who can be <unk> with the professionals who are not <unk> in medicine .
I mean , the dentists , <unk> and psychologists , but especially at the <unk> .
Of course , most doctors have no idea that it &apos;s harder to get out of today in a <unk> <unk> than a medical worker , and when we go to medicine learned everything you &apos;re relevant to know about a species , Homo sapiens . But the <unk> must learn about health and the <unk> disease , we &apos;re going to <unk> , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame to the <unk> by <unk> <unk> with <unk> and ignorance of my profession .
So here &apos;s a joke from the <unk> of <unk> : How do you call a <unk> that you just know ?
Doctor <unk> this device became in my passion , and I &apos;m doing it through the programs like Darwin &apos;s <unk> on <unk> , in the <unk> in the <unk> of the specialists in the animals and the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> our own home and residents .
And through the Hebrew Conference , where we were taking a medical system and <unk> to remain rapid debates about the diseases and the disorders of human patients and animals .
In the Hebrew Conference of subjects like a treatment of a chest cancer , a chest cancer in a <unk> <unk> can help us better , a child &apos;s computer education school ; how to understand the <unk> of a <unk> cow â€” how to understand the <unk> of a <unk> cow , and how to understand better the treatment of the time of the separation of the time .
In the Hebrew Conference , first in America , and now around the world , doctors and now the world , doctors and <unk> leave their <unk> and <unk> them as a child , as a doctors .
For the end , humans are also animal , and it &apos;s already time that we , doctors , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> in a <unk> health care that we &apos;ve made all of the species .
Because it turns out that some of the best and most <unk> medicine are being <unk> by the doctors who are working with the doctors who are not humans .
And one of the best ways of designing the human patient is <unk> very carefully , as all other patients in the planet &apos;s living planet , they grow and they were <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
It &apos;s beautiful , right ?
( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So here the key word is &quot; &quot; . <unk> !
( Applause ) To <unk> brain <unk> , as you can imagine , it was , as you can imagine , because you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because you can imagine , you can actually imagine , that &apos;s because
I didn &apos;t know about the <unk> .
In cultures , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , in cultures in the world , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , when you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you have <unk> , you have <unk> , in the Western cultures , when you
Life , a complex human being complex , is replaced by data , the <unk> , the medical results , the results of the lab , the list of medicine ...
Suddenly it would have been a disease with legs .
The doctors start talking to a language that you don &apos;t get to .
You &apos;ll make your head your body and your body your body and your <unk> .
People starts to change too much because they &apos;re starting to treat the disease instead of the person .
<unk> : What do you say , what would you say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; We even say &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As so much , I would say , &quot; &quot; Hello . &quot; &quot; As much as I say , I would love to ask anyone to have answer .
Do you remember the guy who &apos;s â€” you &apos;re who you work with <unk> ?
Am I who study ? How do love ? &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m a creative ?
<unk> : &quot; &quot; What I did to do this to do this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; I can change something in my life style ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : there &apos;s something that can do it ?
Is there any other choice ? &quot; &quot; And of course , doctors are the good types in all cases , because they &apos;re very expressive and engaged with <unk> .
But they also are very used to treating patients , so I would say that sometimes lost the way to the point of you is an torture and you &apos;re an torture and you &apos;re going to be <unk> , and you &apos;re like <unk> , literally in a patient .
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but the typical thing is that we &apos;re going to take away from any way to know your situation , to make it better to your family and friends or in order to create some way of changing your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you &apos;re going on .
But with all , you &apos;ll get to take the track in your hands of a very high booth .
Whereas I was in the hospital , I asked them to tell me that I was interviewing me from my <unk> <unk> <unk> that I was interviewing me to read my <unk> from my <unk> <unk> <unk> that I was in the hospital , asked me to him , I asked him to him and I &apos;d ask me to him at the hospital , I asked him to him and I &apos;d ask me to him at the hospital , I asked him to him and I &apos;d asked me to him , I &apos;d ask me to
It was very hard to do , because it &apos;s not very much to ask a picture of your own <unk> .
I &apos;ve talked to him and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we don &apos;t know me .
I &apos;m more like this .
The cure , is what it is , has to deal with all my own . &quot; &quot; So the next cure was the most , &quot; &quot; So the answer , is what I would like to do in the hospital , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
I was decided to change my relationship with the <unk> and I was decided to learn more about him before I do something as a surgery .
It &apos;s an artist , use many kinds of technologies to open and open information in my work .
So my great bet was spreading all the data , getting the data , and do it in such a way that any could be able to be able to be able to do it .
So I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created a web site called &quot; &quot; La La <unk> , &quot; &quot; â€” I created a web site called &quot; &quot;
As I had to take it , but that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk to you , but that &apos;s actually going to talk to another talk .
( Laughter ) So we would ask this word , &quot; &quot; La <unk> , &quot; &quot; because in Italian means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; can have many meanings .
In our secular culture means to eradicate or make a scale to disease , but in other cultures as for example of Asia , from the Mediterranean , the West Bank , or Africa , can represent many other things .
So of course I interested in the opinion of medical medical and the rest of the health care , but also me interested in the <unk> proposal for an artist , by the poet , by the <unk> , or , why not , by musicians .
It was <unk> social <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And it worked .
The site La <unk> would come around the world .
It was very much fun to me from Italy and the <unk> and the days of <unk> people in very little days of emails through emails , social media â€” most of the most <unk> were counseling of how to do my own <unk> , but many more they were intrigued of how to do it as I was .
For example , <unk> thousands of videos , images , photos and figments <unk> to La <unk> .
We have here , of Francesca <unk> and his <unk> .
Or what did the artist Patrick <unk> : You add a sculpture in 3D of my tumor and <unk> it into <unk> .
Now you can have my <unk> !
( Laughter ) If you think it &apos;s something that you can share the same <unk> .
And this was what was happening in the scientific , scientific , global medicine in traditional disciplines , various researchers , all of the researchers , all they were connected to me .
Given this information , and support , I was able to collect a team of neurosurgeons , traditional doctors , <unk> and many hundreds of <unk> with the ones I could talk about information about information that would be responsible , which is very important .
We &apos;ve got to formulate an strategy from my own own <unk> in different languages and across different cultures .
So the current strategy would take the entire world and thousands of years of human history , I think I find a lot of a sense .
&#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#91; &#93;
So I could take my time to be a lot .
I was going to take the doctor with my doctor who wanted to work , I would run the hospital when I wanted to be , and all while thousands of people were comfortable with me .
All the world felt that could be <unk> <unk> , and this was the most important part of La <unk> .
What are the results ?
I &apos;m okay , as you can see , very well .
( Applause ) <unk> bad news : I have â€” wow , I &apos;m â€” it &apos;s a very low <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> <unk> that &apos;s not too much .
I was totally my life and my lifestyle life .
It was very intense , I was very intense , I was very intense , I was a net in the electrodes of this side , to build a functional map of what the brain is controlling .
And just before the operation , we were able to look at this map with the doctor to understand the risks I was going to run and if there was some of some of me like I &apos;d like to avoid .
Obviously , it &apos;s <unk> .
This whole key was the very very popular La <unk> .
We &apos;re going to teach them to help their stories , their stories .
The doctors came to talk to people who usually don &apos;t have to be asked when it &apos;s about <unk> .
I was going to tell me , I &apos;m a still accurate state of translation , between many different languages , where the science is shown with emotion and the modern research .
&#91; <unk> &#93; The key point of La <unk> was <unk> part of a truly committed to a truly committed and connected to the global well-being of each of their individuals .
This global <unk> is my <unk> code for <unk> .
( Applause )
I don &apos;t have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I can &apos;t say , what &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know that there was to be a song before .
So I think I &apos;ll start with what I &apos;m going to start with .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Well , before I was nothing , I was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , ( Applause ) I &apos;ll take Travis on the ground . ( Applause )
<unk> , like we call it , is an incredible space .
It &apos;s a holy place .
And one of the things that makes sacred <unk> is that we don &apos;t give us the chance to think about the future , or in the past .
It &apos;s very much alive now .
There are so many decisions when you go to <unk> .
We didn &apos;t have any idea what we were coming .
So one of us did a interpretation of a song called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; But that could happen to happen or not .
All listening . We respond .
There &apos;s not time for the ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s more easy to talk about someone else &apos;s error .
So the way I was making a mistake when I &apos;m in the <unk> â€” before I &apos;m in the <unk> â€” I don &apos;t see it as a mistake .
The only mistake we would have is not who to understand that &apos;s what another did is .
Every &quot; &quot; error is &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in jazz .
And even though it &apos;s hard to describe what it would be a fun .
For example , if I &apos;m painting a color , like if I &apos;m playing with the palette , you &apos;ll be sonar like this ...
( Music ) If Christian rings , I like to <unk> â€” ( Music ) ( Music ) If Christian rings .
You see , it &apos;s all fits in the forest palette .
If it comes to light .
You see , all of it in the interior of this nuclear revolution that we &apos;re painting .
But if you touch <unk> <unk> , most of ears will get a mistake .
You &apos;re going to see , let &apos;s play a moment .
And we &apos;re going to play this palette .
At the moment , Christian summer was add to this .
And we &apos;re not going to get the name .
I &apos;d love to play for a second and then I &apos;ll be able to stop and talk to you a moment .
So let &apos;s see that &apos;s what happens when we touch this palette .
( Music ) ( Music ) <unk> , somebody could be <unk> as a mistake .
I just would just say it &apos;s a mistake that &apos;s not going to be wrong .
An lost chance .
So it &apos;s <unk> . We &apos;re going to paint this palette again .
He &apos;s going to play . I don &apos;t know how we go to the name , but something will switch .
We &apos;re going to embrace your ideas , or not .
( Music ) You see , she touched his bill .
And I created a melody .
This time changed the texture .
It was a little more rhythmic , a little more intense , very much more intense .
So there &apos;s no mistake .
The only mistake is , if you don &apos;t think , if every musician is not conscious , and not to be aware of their partners to identify the idea and we won &apos;t allow creativity .
This <unk> is really incredible .
It &apos;s an <unk> experience .
And I know why I &apos;m talking about all when I say we don &apos;t .
We know that to be able to climb into the <unk> and to make music is a blessing .
What do you have to do this with finance ?
We all are <unk> musicians , our <unk> is not the most far beyond the finance .
( Laughter ) I just wanted to show you how the wires are .
And the other thing is that we don &apos;t have <unk> in jazz .
There are people who do it .
But it &apos;s accurate the odds .
If you &apos;re going to get it up to the band that you &apos;re going to do it so I want to take it up , and I say to go on â€” ...
Come on , I &apos;m going to show you something .
One , two , two , three , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s a little bit chaotic because I &apos;m going to give me the ideas .
<unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> by this side . &quot; &quot; If I want the music , the best I can do is to listen .
It &apos;s the science of the ear .
It has more than seeing what I can tell about what I can do .
If I want the music to take a certain level of <unk> , the first step for me is being patient , listening to what happens and collect something else what happens to me .
When you do it , you would <unk> and <unk> the other musicians and they &apos;re going to get more , and so that &apos;s going to do it .
Look , one , two , two , two , three , three , four .
( Music ) ( Music ) It &apos;s something totally different when I shot my ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It has many more <unk> .
It &apos;s not about to get my vision to me .
It is about to be at the moment , we &apos;re getting to each other and let it make creativity .
Thank you .

I &apos;m going to be sincere , so these incredible talks and ideas are being exposed to , <unk> on the position of it , and it was going to tell you about the television .
All the world sees the television .
We have to take it . They &apos;ll take some other aspects .
This in America are people in it .
The media is a <unk> , a <unk> , almost five hours of day .
Well ?
I put myself on the television , so I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
But the many people don &apos;t like .
They did it , they <unk> .
<unk> that it &apos;s useless , and things worse , it &apos;s <unk> .
My mother , when I was a girl , I was a girl , &quot; &quot; The <unk> box . &quot; &quot; My intention is not <unk> if there &apos;s the good television or the television â€” my idea today is to tell you that the television has consciousness .
If I think the television is consciousness is because I think that the television of it directly directly , and social , emotionally <unk> in our nation â€” television and emotional <unk> in our nation â€” television is how we &apos;re all related to our values .
All of that is intrinsic to humans and we will be able to adapt to our sense of consciousness .
Today we don &apos;t talk about good or bad television .
We talk about <unk> television .
We talk about 10 programs with the greatest audience for a <unk> period for a <unk> period .
As that distinction reflects not only what you &apos;ve been to have , which is the idea of our social social social social social social and collective collective , if we don &apos;t , how many of these programs have been able to have the idea of our social consciousness ?
As we &apos;re focusing on television over time , and what tells us to do this to our society ?
It &apos;s going to be the topic of evolution , from a basic biology , if it &apos;s <unk> that the animal kingdom , including humans , has four primary primary instincts .
<unk> , relationships , power , and the desire of <unk> .
As humans , what you &apos;ve reminded you is that we &apos;re going to get us up with the time until we were able to use these basic animal instincts .
We have the ability to laugh and cry .
We feel fear , compassion .
This is not the case in the animal kingdom .
The other thing we &apos;ve described human beings is we love the entertainment .
You see the television .
This is something that we &apos;re clearly in the animal &apos;s clearly in the animal world .
In animals , you can just play it , but you don &apos;t know how to look at it .
So I &apos;m aiming to discover what understands from this relationship of human beings among the television programs and human consciousness .
Why the hell evolved this is ?
The kid said , &quot; &quot; I would love like the hell of the y-axis and the <unk> sitting in our shoulder .
<unk> works like our consciousness , we would have <unk> and <unk> at the same time ?
To try to challenge these questions , we &apos;ve done a research study .
<unk> 50 years to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s called <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the audience that was 100 years ago â€” thousands of programs .
We talk to 3,000 people almost almost <unk> â€” about 18 and 70 years , and we would have been <unk> as if we were emotionally emotionally .
How did you tell you about a single one of these programs ?
Do you want a moral moral ?
Did you get <unk> ? <unk> ?
What &apos;s meant for you ?
For our TED TED audience , I mean that this would spread the cable in the United States .
But as you can see , these states of emotional , is universal .
And second , an 80 percent of the most popular programs of the U.S. <unk> at the rest of the world .
I wish we can tell our audience <unk> if I &apos;m going to <unk> .
I want to give you the two people before I went to the first slide : Why <unk> inspired me to think of the idea of consciousness and the <unk> that consciousness can be <unk> in the day day , and Jack Stern .
And so in the way I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to give you the data to show you why Hans Rosling , who you &apos;d like to see .
Well , let &apos;s go back .
Here , since 1960 , since 1960 , the 50 to 2010 , 50 years of our study .
There are two things we &apos;re going to start with the state of inspiration and the state of moral <unk> , which is to define the story as the television shows that they &apos;re going to make me better with the television that are going to make me better with the world .
<unk> moral <unk> are the programs that don &apos;t make the difference between good and bad .
At principle , you see that in 1960 the 1960 <unk> <unk> .
So we see the television .
<unk> moral <unk> starts to mobilize .
I &apos;m going to end up the back of 60 , <unk> moral <unk> , and the low <unk> .
Why ?
The crisis of the Cuba , the <unk> and <unk> , the movement by the <unk> , shared cosmology , the Vietnam War , the <unk> of the Vietnam Ice Fund , the <unk> of the <unk> of King and Bobby <unk> , the <unk> scandal .
Look what happens .
1970 the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> moral <unk> .
<unk> , more Ronald Reagan , a television president , is in control .
It was going to get the flight .
But look , you can &apos;t say , the <unk> , the <unk> , Chernobyl , Chernobyl .
<unk> moral <unk> becomes the dominant tendency for 1990 to 20 years .
You &apos;ll just look at this .
This graph is just a similar tendency .
But in this case , we have the happiness <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in blue and green .
At that time , we have &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; we have &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; we have the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and national programs that <unk> happiness .
It will increase . The happiness will <unk> all .
<unk> starts to rise .
<unk> the social methodology increases .
We have come up to 1969 and look what happens .
The happiness , the <unk> and the social comment , not only are they in our society , but there &apos;s no two programs , and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk>
What was the number one ?
The very few <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> and Martin &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
We all were going to be working together .
The secular <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s see this green peak in <unk> with a second of trends .
When I was going to ask the term , successful no precedent , which means ?
I mean , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> came from <unk> .
This was the first program that I was saying to say , &quot; &quot; my god , I can comment on what I think of the Vietnam War , about the president , through the television &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? That &apos;s what means a successful problem .
Well , the same thing in the last graph look what happens .
1970 , <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
We don &apos;t see the television by entertainment .
The social comment and <unk> <unk> over 70 .
Now look at this .
How would you negotiate the 70 ? Norman Lear .
We have &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sanford and <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the main program in the technologies 10 to the next decade of the 70 â€” <unk> .
In the 50 years of television that we study , seven of the 10 programs have been <unk> back during the Cold War , five of the <unk> <unk> .
Only a generation , 20 years , and we &apos;ve found , okay , <unk> !
Could you feel that ?
Can you get it ?
The audience so I knew , I want to tell the people of the digital people won &apos;t have the problems .
Archie Bunker was pushed out of his <unk> with the rest of us , and Archie Bunker was pushed away from his <unk> with the rest of us .
This is another chart , and by other <unk> , <unk> other <unk> : <unk> and imagination , which are now planning as well as a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a statistic of the <unk> , the saying it &apos;s an statistic of the <unk> of <unk> .
I &apos;ll tell you that every time you get <unk> and imagination , it matches a <unk> of the stop .
We want to see programs about people saving money and stop ?
We don &apos;t . In the 70s we have the current <unk> <unk> that if you were able to get the <unk> samples in 1973 , followed by &quot; &quot; The man of six billion dollars &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; The Great Book . &quot; &quot; Another peak in the 1980s â€” another peak of the 1980s â€” another peak of a <unk> , another peak of programs about control and power .
What was the programs in the programs ?
They were <unk> and rich .
&quot; &quot; Dallas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> Island . &quot;
A <unk> shows from our national psyche , with rapid and tough , the stop .
Now this , my favorite graph , because these are the last 20 years .
I was told or not in my <unk> , secure ones that have been hearing or <unk> about the fall of the <unk> and the <unk> .
As you say this <unk> , the slope of the place .
The chicken , the decade of humor , <unk> like &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; All right , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the course of the humor , the decade of humor , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot;
But look like the slope , the slope .
In 2001 , in September of 2001 , the reverse of the judgment .
Why don &apos;t you ?
We had the presidential 2000s of 2,000 of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the technological <unk> .
The third of September .
The <unk> <unk> in part of the social diversity .
It turns out what happens with time .
In the change , the Internet is <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
What do people in your condom ?
I would argue that we were <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> happiness , my world are down below .
Don &apos;t , they want to judge our judge .
I can get it out of the island .
I can do that the daughter of Sarah Palin dance .
I can spend the new <unk> . You &apos;re <unk> .
Great , yeah ?
It turns out to radically different things that are these programs , pure entertainment , two there , there &apos;s the one that I said at the beginning of the beginning ? You &apos;ll get a basics .
We are animals , we need our own .
There was no second in television without a <unk> and absolute mother .
In the decade of the <unk> : June <unk> in the <unk> program , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of social consciousness .
<unk> <unk> , the archetype of the <unk> <unk> , who talked about abortion , <unk> , even the <unk> on the television .
In the 1980s , it &apos;s the first <unk> way to Alexis <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Video ) <unk> Brown <unk> with a <unk> when I had a thought of being a single mother .
The mother of this was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was , he was ,
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a demo or a reminder of it in our consciousness , sitting in our attitudes , what I know is I &apos;ve been doing this picture .
So all of us , women and men from <unk> , the audience of <unk> , thank you by <unk> to my idea of television .
But also let me give you the <unk> to the <unk> that would take me from the morning to get their ideas in our fingertips in the ages of these days .
Dan your life , insurance , but you &apos;re worried how to allow it to the collective social social awareness of collective social social awareness , longevity or not .
So thank you so much .

In 1994 , I went into a prison in <unk> and I met a child from 12 years that he gave me and to tell her to one lawyer .
And by the <unk> to the eyes of my eyes , I realized that the hundreds of letters that had written to farmers , never to see any letter to him , because it wasn &apos;t a eight-year-old that made something important to someone .
It wasn &apos;t a political player .
It was a child from 12 years old that had a bicycle .
What I also realized was that it wasn &apos;t just that it wasn &apos;t just in <unk> , but that &apos;s not just <unk> , but that &apos;s the developing world in the developing world that we &apos;ve been <unk> , 93 of these countries made laws that have the right to one lawyer .
And I realized that there were an incredible <unk> of opportunities for all of us as a global community for all of us as global global , and we &apos;ve finally managed to deny the torture of research that we &apos;re working on and then we can finally deny the torture of research .
So often we think about torture as a form of political torture or a political torture or it &apos;s reserved for only the worst but in fact , 95 percent of the <unk> today are not to work in political .
They are for people who are in the <unk> systems of <unk> and by unfortunately , they have the torture &apos;s way the most cheaper way of research that &apos;s cheaper than having a lawyer , cheaper than having a lawyer or access to the assistance of the assistance that &apos;s most of the time .
The day of today we &apos;ve seen that we are possible to ourselves as a global community , if we take that decision , we &apos;ll take it and end up the torture , and then the torture is the ethic as a research method for our lives , but this is the <unk> of three things .
First comes the ability , the power of power and connection needs the world &apos;s scale .
The second is to make sure there &apos;s a little bit <unk> and systematic the victims .
And the third is the commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I started <unk> , and if you were <unk> ?
Could we do something about these about 93 countries ?
And I founded <unk> &apos;s to <unk> that has been as specific to the specific quest of the ending with the torture method of research and put in practice the <unk> rights in these caves , and they were sending them into a early phase in <unk> and courts .
However , my first experiences came from <unk> and the <unk> of my first visit to <unk> , when there was , in 1994 , even less than 10 of the country in the country because the <unk> <unk> <unk> all .
And even 20 years later , so it was only 10 lawyers in the country and so forth , by the way , in a prison , not only <unk> a 13-year-old boy , but you &apos;re going to <unk> with women too , and the <unk> &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ll take here from 10 times 10 years because my husband committed a little <unk> but you can &apos;t find it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a place where they didn &apos;t
The first group of <unk> <unk> and still remember , while I asked me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do to research ? &quot; &quot; &#93; .
And the room was going to take silence and finally a woman called &quot; &quot; name <unk> , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; The teacher . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been more than a lot of people and I &apos;ve ever imagined that &quot; &quot; professor . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been more than a lot of people and I &apos;ve ever imagined that &apos;s because all of the fact that we &apos;re all more of the
And these teachers had to be <unk> to decide that they would take to defend themselves and <unk> them between them so that they can put into practice these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where some of the <unk> came up , the top of it and the rest behind me , and they were <unk> as the same as the <unk> , and they were <unk> , whereas the <unk> left , I said , &quot; &quot; No , not , we &apos;re going to do things the same way in the same way in which you have done to the way . &quot; &quot; But one day , the perfect case .
She said that it actually looked like the person to get to the person to get to the <unk> and I believe that I would have a lot of it in a question , but the police came up , and she didn &apos;t have nothing to it .
So then she was <unk> . She had <unk> emails .
And when he took his case to a judge , for the first time this <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for the <unk> and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for the <unk> and so it will be washed away in freedom . &quot; &quot; And the judge started taking cases a way to change the course of the story of <unk> .
But it &apos;s not true .
And I used to think , then it &apos;s just going to <unk> ?
Or also happens in other countries ?
But there &apos;s so many countries â€” there &apos;s so many countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s a lot of countries â€” there &apos;s
In Burundi , I went into a prison and there was no eight-year-old , but a child &apos;s eight-year-old that would take a cell phone .
Or a woman , I sat in arms on his baby , a very beautiful baby , and I said , &quot; &quot; Your baby is so beautiful ! &quot; &quot; But it was not a baby , the girl was three years old .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , but I &apos;m here by she , but I &apos;m not here by <unk> two <unk> and a iron in his baby and still the way that I was in prison .
And when I went through the letter from prison , I said , &quot; &quot; You have to <unk> it in freedom .
A judge will get rid of the free . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can <unk> , but look at my prison , and the 80 percent of the two thousands of people here are not lawyers . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; And then the lawyers had the <unk> to organize a system where they could take the cases .
And we realized that not only was the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that we have to take the difference .
For example , in <unk> , what happened was that &#91; &#93; &#93; &#91; &#93; &#93; it wasn &apos;t true but he had the 24 member of her who had been <unk> . And the same way , in China , always me who is like a cool wind in the Thar Desert when we can <unk> . &quot; &quot; Or in <unk> , where the world had , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot;
And I heard , &quot; &quot; I heard you that we can &apos;t help to create fairness , we don &apos;t have to fight our efforts , we don &apos;t need the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want to tell you that the lack of resources never was <unk> to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And with this organized organized the red carpet that you can reach the cases of systematic , the random frequency that you can reach the cases of systematic .
So , the solution we found was the ability and then the solution , the access to it .
I was recently in <unk> and I decided to <unk> with another group of lawyers . What was me was they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have the streets . The police is one of the main reasons we had the revolution . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But here we &apos;ve been taking tens of millions of dollars in a lot of a few hours in the development of the <unk> system .
What &apos;s going to happen then ? &quot; &quot; <unk> with one of the development agencies and they were forming a tax and <unk> hole , which turns out to be the normal molecule , instead of the <unk> .
It &apos;s also a manual <unk> manual <unk> manual <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> . &quot; &quot; They all got it up . The lawyers can come to the police station .
<unk> are perfectly trained .
But I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just a question . Before we all went to the valuation of the valuation , which would happen to them while ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
And by the very very small pieces are not just the whole background of lawyers , but they have to find a way to go to the circle of the lawyers , because they are the guarantee in the system for people who are being tortured .
And while I &apos;m saying this , they &apos;re also conscious , that sounds like a &quot; &quot; Yes , of course , seems like if you could do it , but you &apos;re going to do it in reality ? &quot; &quot; Because it seems like a huge thing .
And they &apos;re a lot of the reasons why I think we &apos;re possible .
The first one is that people about the Taliban in the California are way to create miracles through your commitment .
And it &apos;s not just <unk> , who I spoke to you , but also , but also , it also advocates around the world that are looking at the key pieces .
We have a program called <unk> , and we realized that there were people who were <unk> and who wanted to help , but how could we get them ?
So so much is a competition in line where you can win five thousand dollars if you &apos;re going to win a <unk> idea of making fairness .
And there &apos;s 30 <unk> around the world , from Sri Lankan to <unk> or <unk> or the Democratic Republic of Congo , who had five billion dollars made of an unbelievable thing , through SMS , through SMS , and whatever the case .
And there &apos;s not only these <unk> , but there are also people who are going to be able to tell what they are their contacts and how they can move them together .
For example , in China &apos;s <unk> laws that were expected to be abused people who were punished .
And while I was sitting in this one of our lawyers lawyers , I said , &quot; &quot; What can we do ? How can we do it ? How can we make it ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I wrote , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s still a way . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s still a way . &quot; &quot; And the 4 October raised in three billion members of the Union &apos;s <unk> , of the <unk> school members of the U.S. State of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> came to the police and found a second legal and <unk> revolution .
I &apos;ve talked about the fact that we need to form and support the capacity .
We need to go out of practice in the <unk> way to change the way to care .
But the third and last point , the most important thing is that we &apos;re facing with this .
And usually the people say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is very well , but it &apos;s too idealistic .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the reason I think this view is interesting is because that &apos;s exactly the same opinion that we had to get to the people who were expected to end the slavery thing to be expected to be the slavery .
It started with a small group of people who decided to <unk> .
One of our favorite poems of the teachers , who they share with themselves , is , &quot; &quot; No , you &apos;re worth value , friends , the way it &apos;s going to be long , the route never is clear , and there &apos;s a lot of hard , and there &apos;s a lot of hard , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of it , but in the bottom , you &apos;re not going to be safe as a research community , and there &apos;s a lot
And I &apos;ve always wondered , because I know the question will be that , and it will be a pleasure to talk to you for you , &quot; But what can I do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m first sure you can do it . &quot; &quot; Well , secondly , I &apos;m sure you can do it . And secondly , we &apos;ve been able to figure out what you can do . And secondly , we would have to set out the story of <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> was a three-year-old child when I met him in a <unk> prison in the <unk> <unk> , but as I was in prison , they all had a lot of <unk> , even the <unk> , so I was the only one that could come and go out between the <unk> .
And of course , as you know , there &apos;s <unk> . And for the time we were able to get to grow , which is what it is also grows ?
What was it was going to happen for the first <unk> , and the second and then the third and then , very soon , it &apos;s a head of head to be able to <unk> through and <unk> it , and then we would run the third to the first one . And he would put his finger , because what he wanted to do was to go to me .
So of course , I never had to visit the whole world every day , but he &apos;s trying to visit all IKEA bothered . And by the <unk> , he was going to visit his fingers through .
Or if the cells were dark , it was like iron <unk> and it would become their fingers through .
And most of the <unk> <unk> that was his biggest <unk> and his sun and the sun and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and I thought , here &apos;s a <unk> .
Born in a prison without nothing , without anything , without a sense of his own <unk> , who in my opinion all of your own dreams , who in my opinion are going to be a little bit of one . And I told me , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t help do it all .
But they &apos;re a person . I can do something .
And I will do the only thing I can do . &quot; &quot; And so I would argue by having the imagination to have the imagination to imagine the training of a new world with all of us together and I invite you to do this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think there &apos;s a formula for TED Talks : &quot; Be a Talk on a red red . &quot;
If a story of my childhood is referred to a story of a childhood .
&quot; &quot; <unk> a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; <unk> with me with a inspirational call called action . &quot;
No .
It &apos;s not like that you think of a TED .
In fact , if we were going to be too much more these mechanisms , we would have a <unk> or a emotional <unk> .
But there &apos;s one thing that all the TED Talks are in common , and I &apos;d like to share with you , because I &apos;m going to share with you , because I &apos;m going to talk to you , I hear my life , because I &apos;m going to talk to you about a lot of great TED Talks , like these .
I would argue with your talk of the audience , and I learned directly directly from the secrets of a great Talk .
And yet these <unk> and their subjects seem completely different , they all have a common ingredient .
And this is the thing : The main task as <unk> is to transfer the mind of who you hear an remarkable gift , an unusual and beautiful object that we call a sense .
Let me <unk> .
Here &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s about to give a TED Talk , and , frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> Van <unk> !
( Applause ) ( Applause ) So one of the most important things I never would never see before feel that your brains are going to be able to get their brains to <unk> and between themselves .
They &apos;re literally beginning to <unk> the same same pattern in brain patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean that they are to make the same emotions .
We &apos;re going to make a look at the brain by taking a moment .
There are millions of neurons in a <unk> .
But look at here , right here , a few billion are wired between each one that represents a very nice idea .
within the whole audience , inside the audience &apos;s mind inside the audience .
It &apos;s like this ; it just a couple of minutes , a pattern that involves millions of neurons to one 200 , just with that 200 , and look at a face and look at a face .
But <unk> , which is an idea ?
Well , you can actually <unk> as a pattern of information that helps understanding and navigate the world .
The ideas came from many ways and <unk> , from the complex and <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> by the very simple and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the ideas came from many ways and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
So here &apos;s a couple of examples from this time since TED stage .
Ken Robinson Robinson <unk> creativity is the key of our future of our kids .
( Video ) Sir Ken Robinson : What is the creativity that the creativity now is , and we have <unk> with the same status .
Chris Anderson : <unk> Hardy <unk> with <unk> is beautiful .
( Video ) <unk> 4 : <unk> around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s strong , resists <unk> .
CA : <unk> grants to people is more than a simple identity .
Video : <unk> : <unk> story : <unk> , and the problem with stereotypes is not that it &apos;s fake , it &apos;s untrue .
CA : Your mind makes ideas , and not the randomly troll .
They &apos;re worried related to us .
It turns out , make an incredible structure that &apos;s a complex structure that &apos;s your personal view of the world .
It &apos;s the operating system of your brain .
It &apos;s like <unk> across the world .
And it &apos;s <unk> from millions of individual ideas .
If , for example , a small component of your world &apos;s view is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is going to be <unk> , then the green is going to be the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the idea that the <unk> are <unk> , then the green is the
But if another component of your world &apos;s view is the idea that leopards is dangerous , then the green are actually dangerous way .
So it &apos;s quite obvious that the ideas that make your vision of the world are crucial .
It turns out that the most salient thing that is the most insidious thing that is possible , a cholesterol to the <unk> , but wonderful world of the outside .
Now , the different visions of the world &apos;s everyday can be very different .
For example , how responds your view of the world when you see this picture : ( Video ) Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you see me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a
Or &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; a terrorist .
CA : Whatever it is the answer , there &apos;s millions of people there that are very different .
If you &apos;re going to be a second , you &apos;re able to change , forever , the way you see the world and transform their actions so much now like the future .
The ideas are the most powerful force that we would have to <unk> the human culture .
So if you think about your main task as it is to build a sense of your audiences in your audiences , there &apos;s four <unk> to address that task : First , you &apos;re going to ask your talk to one idea .
The ideas are complex things ; we need to reduce the content to be able to get rid of the simple idea that more of you , and having the chance to do it well .
You have to give context , share examples , to try to be curious .
So I would have a thought of a sense , and it &apos;s a thread that &apos;s going to make a thread that will take all your talk , so that everything that we would have <unk> in a way .
And secondly , I &apos;m going to tell you a reason for you to do something reason to do .
Before we start to build things in your audiences of your audiences , you have to have their permission to get it .
And what is the tool to do ?
Curiosity .
It &apos;s going to give you your audience curiosity .
We ask questions <unk> , <unk> questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t have meaning and accurate .
If you can reveal a <unk> on the world of someone &apos;s view , you &apos;ll take a need to meet that gap of knowledge .
And when I was saying that wish is much easier to start to build the idea .
Third , you &apos;ll get a piece of a piece of storytelling from the concepts that your audience knows .
We &apos;ve made the power of language to weave concepts that have already been in the mind of who &apos;s not in the mind of who doesn &apos;t listen but not in your language in their language .
They would take care where they are .
The <unk> would have been <unk> that many terms and concepts with the ones that are completely <unk> to their audiences .
Well , metaphors play a crucial role to show how fit the bits , because it &apos;s <unk> the way you see the bits of the pattern , based on a sense that who hears understands .
For example , when <unk> Jennifer was explaining the amazing new biotech system called CRISPR , he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , for the first time , you would have a text text to edit DNA .
<unk> allows us to cut and take information together very easily . &quot; &quot; Well , an explanation , a graph like this <unk> was a big moment of <unk> while it fits in your mind .
It &apos;s important , for so much , as much as I think I learned with friends of trust , and see the way that parts are more <unk> .
<unk> . Here goes the end â€” let your ideas uncomfortable to be <unk> .
So when I mean that you &apos;ll do this question , &quot; What &apos;s going to have this idea ? &quot;
And I need to <unk> it with the answer .
If the idea only benefit to you and your own organization , then I feel like , probably not necessarily to be a shared .
The audience will see through you .
But if you think it &apos;s an idea of <unk> <unk> , the potential of one or to change the perspective of somebody to better or inspire somebody to do things in another way , then you have the essential ingredient for a good Talk of truth , one that can be a gift for them and for all of us .
It &apos;s just one 25 percent than we &apos;ve heard .
I would argue that the whole day comes from every day , and I would argue that the <unk> of all days I would argue that the <unk> of all days was that the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> all over and <unk> it all over time , <unk> that <unk> all of the days that I would argue that the <unk> of all days would be that <unk> <unk> that <unk> all over time , <unk> that <unk> all over time , <unk> that <unk> all over time , <unk> that <unk> all over time , <unk> that
( <unk> ) So with this <unk> , it turns out that it works hard to listen , listening to <unk> .
And the art of the conversation of the conversation is , and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of the conversation and the art of the conversation of
A world where we &apos;re not listening to each other to each other .
And to illustrate , to <unk> and recalibrate the ear of <unk> and recalibrate the ear of <unk> and recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear of <unk> and to recalibrate the ear
It &apos;s about to appreciate the ordinary sounds .
For example , this is my <unk> .
So you see that ordinary sounds can be very interesting if you get attention .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) The sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
Imagine you &apos;re a parking little waste of any place of America and you would have a <unk> and <unk> : &quot; Sorry , what is the name of that apple ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; <unk> ... &quot; &quot; â€” this is the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> Street .
This is the street street , that the 27 . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Okay . What &apos;s the name of that apple apple ? &quot; &quot; <unk> : &quot; &quot; Well , the apples don &apos;t have names .
The streets have names , the apples they are only <unk> without the name between the streets . &quot; &quot; The <unk> march , a little bit <unk> and <unk> .
Now , imagine you &apos;re a parking ticket street , you &apos;ll tell you the person you have to do and ask questions , &quot; &quot; <unk> , how did this list ?
They <unk> , &quot; &quot; Well , this is the apple apple and that the 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but what &apos;s the name of this little girl ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , the streets don &apos;t have names .
The apples you do .
Look Google Google is here . There &apos;s the apple requirements , 15 , 16 , 17 , age , 18 .
All of these apples have names , and the streets are only the <unk> of the <unk> of apples .
And then you say , &quot; &quot; So how do you know your house ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s easy . This is the <unk> 8 .
<unk> 17 , I &apos;m a one . &quot; &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Okay . But then I walk through the <unk> , the numbers of the houses are not in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course , you &apos;re . They &apos;re in order to get rid of the brain that were <unk> .
The first house was <unk> in an apple is the number one .
The second house that we built is the two two .
The third one is the first three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; I love it , we have to go on the other side of the world to give us some things that would happen to us , and we know that the opposite of it can also be true .
As for example , there &apos;s doctors in China that believe their work is normal .
So every month you &apos;re healthy , you have to <unk> , and when you &apos;re going to get it , you pay it because you &apos;re going to get it up in your job . They &apos;re rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) We think about the music that it &apos;s the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is the beginning of music , and one , two , three , four .
But in the west of Africa , the &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , as the end of a sentence .
So let me hear not just in the <unk> , but in the way , I mean , two , three , four , one .
And this map also is true and accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a quote that we reported for any thing , but it &apos;s been saying about India , the opposite will be true .
So I don &apos;t have never been never , so I &apos;ve been working on TED as another place , that for any brilliant idea that we have or <unk> , the other really can be true .
They were <unk> <unk> .
