And this is going to be about a million people that are active at the end of this year .
And all of them , all of them , is what they &apos;re going to die .
And while that &apos;s a good idea , but I think it &apos;s a very special way to think about it .
Now , I think that I think of it after a month in Dan &apos;s blog , J@@ r. , Engine@@ ering , Engine@@ ering , a literary scholar who died from cancer .
Ma@@ stery of her family and sister wrote a mystery in the name of his death .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh . I &apos;m going to die , and that &apos;s my last post .
I mean , I &apos;ve got to give you a sense of the cancer of cancer , my family and friends and friends , and I think that &apos;s a little bit skin@@ ni@@ vo@@ tively , which is the first part of my blog from an active part of an effective part of the experience of an active part of my blog .
We see the roofs of the herd .
The 48 hours of ink are uploaded to YouTube .
It &apos;s going to cost 200 dollars .
In the last month , you have a lot of money on Facebook .
If you think about your parents or your grandparents &apos; best , you &apos;ve created a series of photos that have created a couple of photos , whether you &apos;ve done that , or your mother , or whatever .
But today , we are building the richness of the richness of the military as they &apos;re going to live in their lifetime .
And I think it &apos;s created a different way to make it happen .
I &apos;m a magazine , I &apos;m a magazine , not a test , because I &apos;d like to give you a sense of what the reality and the future is going to happen .
We &apos;ve been around the corner of the heart of the world , and we &apos;re going to say that we &apos;re going to think that we &apos;re going to be able to be with our al@@ ig@@ mas and all the money in our lives .
And one day one of them , then , I found myself in the morning in the morning at the same time , in the last year .
( Audio ) Adam : Love .
Death : Adam ?
A : Yeah .
It &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; Where can you go from every place you have an hour , even Ar@@ gu@@ ed .
A : Yeah ?
Death : It &apos;s a f@@ uss .
( Laughter ) A : sleep , isn &apos;t it true ?
This is the heart of your heart , and it &apos;s the same thing that gives you a sense of self or an object or an object that can be sold on Facebook .
My mother has a total of 1,000 spam .
And he was online saying , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; and then it &apos;s going to work with these pictures , and it &apos;s also stories and stories and stories that they &apos;re capable of .
But it &apos;s only an interesting thing .
Now , many of you might think about David Ro@@ ana , who , who has been the same idea as he was healthy to be able to sell more than 90,000 hours to be watched .
I think of it , I think , with the heart of the car , to be able to understand the human nature , and we &apos;ll be able to use it , and we &apos;ll be able to use it , and we &apos;ll be able to use it , and we &apos;re going to make it happen , and we &apos;re catching up with a lot of bumps .
And I think it &apos;s just going to happen , for our own selves , for our own selves , to make sure that we can &apos;t make it happen from the limitations of our deaths , and the result is that we are created , and the technology that we created , and the technology that we &apos;ve created , is that we &apos;re created , and we have the technology to give it the meaning .
We look at a couple of sisters .
There &apos;s a little bit of that with my heart , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say that you &apos;re going to write the next thing . &quot; &quot; And what you would find is that you can write the next thing .
So as you can see , it can be a product .
Well , imagine what &apos;s going to look like five or 10 years or 20 years or so on .
Now , I &apos;m going to go back to the next step , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of what people can see as people .
And if the ro@@ bes could be able to be able to be able to look at the characteristics of California , at the same time , from thousands of alone , that person has created throughout life .
You know , you know , I &apos;m going to give you a message from the United States to the United States in 2008 , when you put C@@ N@@ N@@ N , C@@ N@@ N , C@@ N@@ N , who gave the I@@ N@@ E@@ N Ob@@ serv@@ atory .
What if we were able to make this technology to make our sense of what we &apos;ve done in our lives in the world , we have created a very , very shame that they created .
And I think that it &apos;s probably not , it &apos;s just like we &apos;re doing it , and it &apos;s just a lot of things that we &apos;ve done , and it &apos;s kind of like we &apos;re doing it , and it &apos;s kind of like we &apos;re going to have a little bit of what we have to do with it .
And the result , I think , is that we have all of us , whether we eat ourselves , whether we want to be our reality , and when it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s going to be the truth for life .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
Now , you &apos;ve seen that there are some of the things you &apos;ve seen before , historically .
The first one is from Je@@ an-@@ C@@ lau@@ s .
The other thing is , from your head to conflict , you see the answer to each other .
We understand the more about the complex realities of reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer that question .
It &apos;s also the same thing .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You can make buildings and make them work .
What we have to do is we have to get out of the ar@@ ma@@ tizing world .
The same system , the fish , the fish , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons
And the beauty system is that these systems are not so easy to transform the mathematical wounds .
What about complex systems ?
As it turns out , then it turns out , and then it turns out , and then it turns out , and then it turns out , and then you get the ringing ringing .
And we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it .
It &apos;s the same system .
You know , it &apos;s a system that doesn &apos;t look like this .
And in the study , there &apos;s a solar cell .
but why not in the country ?
Now , carbon grid ?
And we &apos;re focused on our hands .
T@@ ab@@ ner , my name , my father , had an actor .
And what it means is that what it means is something that &apos;s going to happen .
You might think that no one has to look at it .
&quot; How are they organized ? &quot;
Or , car@@ rots , N@@ PR .
These are the companies that work for over the country , and there &apos;s a 2@@ ,000-@@ plus .
There was a place where there were 600 years old , and there was 600 , 600 .
It has about 75 percent of the world &apos;s children .
It &apos;s about financial structures .
But they &apos;re also about 95 percent of the profits from the family , but they &apos;re also producing 95 percent of the profits from the family .
But then the answer to the question is , &quot; &quot; Who is ?
Others can do something like myself .
The moon analogy .
This is the case , and it &apos;s a wi@@ de-@@ angle .
And these demo@@ graph@@ ically 7@@ 37 .
There was a self-@@ rein@@ forcing crop .
You know , it &apos;s exceedingly likely that it &apos;s going to be the universe .
The other day , I want to panic , I want to give you a sense of what I &apos;m talking about .
It actually turns out to be the world when we talk about this .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to meet you , but when I &apos;m going to get this piece of metal , I &apos;m going to go through a picture of a cartoon — like the person &apos;s home , he doesn &apos;t notice , and she &apos;s going to go back to the door .
And I think that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong , because it doesn &apos;t make sense .
There &apos;s no such thing as sudden and non-@@ can@@ on@@ izing .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without overnight .
I was a writer and also a teacher of English as well as saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a writer , I bet life .
And you can tell , and I &apos;d like to give you a sense of what a lot of metal that we live about — maybe even a big part of them — the problem .
So , we fall .
We make it .
We &apos;re going to spend them .
We &apos;re falling at the heart .
We fly from the west .
It makes us all of these things , and it makes us sick .
The first of your hearts , and you lose it .
So that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to make a lot of metal going to the end of the day , and we &apos;re going to get sick .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s that way .
And they &apos;re going to target us as well as non@@ trivial and imp@@ ending limitations .
My love with them is &quot; &quot; Brea@@ king , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; Brea@@ king , &quot; &quot; and when you look at that word , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; and when you look at that word — ( Laughter ) — you know what it means and &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — like , &quot; &quot; You know what it means and &quot; &quot; blah &quot; &quot; — like , &quot; &quot; It means &quot; &quot; speech , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Lord , &quot; &quot; as
How much of the K@@ and@@ ka have 16 winners in the words of &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot;
( Laughter ) We live the words that we need to think about our dreams , to make sure that we &apos;re going to see a little bit of shame . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So what is this like ?
How did we match to identity with a lot of pain and cou@@ gh@@ ing ?
And why are we talking about this home of the world as such as junk ?
It &apos;s hard , but I have a bunch of theories .
And so to make it , I want to get a sense of what I want to say to the extent of the Hir@@ sh@@ horn , which is all about shame .
When I learn about romantic love , I think of these kinds of things that I think about it .
Now , the story of the world &apos;s culture of the synthesis of the corpus call@@ os@@ ic .
This is a couple of examples .
William Sch@@ nell : K@@ ay , it &apos;s only the whole thing of the word &quot; &quot; Game of Th@@ r@@ ones &quot; &quot; .
&quot; &quot; Look at me , &quot; &quot; Look at me , and so forth , so a lot of anger is a little bit of a trick@@ le off of Ba@@ ja Bat@@ les . ( Laughter )
And I ended up in 20 years , and it was called &quot; &quot; Co@@ ding relationships &quot; &quot; from the South .
It was a relationship for the first time I spent a few years , because I &apos;ve seen it very high , and I think it &apos;s very high .
And I remember one moment .
I sat down in the room in the choir in South America , and I was reminded of my ca@@ j@@ ama coming door .
It was a shame , it was a shame , and we went out for dinner , and when we came back to our panic , he gave them a little bit of things in the way that we came back together , and then we came back together .
I mean , I don &apos;t want to remember that night , but I &apos;m really amazed by remembering that , like , I mean , I &apos;m very excited about what I &apos;ve learned .
I was 22 years old , it was my first per@@ turb@@ ation in the country , and I was totally different .
And I went off to my side of my house , and I knew the nest of the city , and the nest of the city , which I had to do was to get out , and I wasn &apos;t alone , but I am not alone .
I didn &apos;t have a lot of money , and I didn &apos;t know a lot of money .
And I could tell you , I could think about it as an opportunity , but I was freezing .
I just sat there .
And then she started crying .
But there &apos;s a little bit wrong with the little voice in my head saying , &quot; &quot; Wow . It was dra@@ ining .
I really get a sense of it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) For a while , a little bit of embarrassment had to feel embarrassed from my dreams .
And it &apos;s a genius for me , but at 22 years old , I &apos;ve been racing about the Dra@@ matic tension , which at the time I was missing , and it was no matter , but I thought it was a little bit wrong , but I thought it was a little bit wrong , but I thought it wasn &apos;t my mind .
I think , in some ways , I mean , I &apos;d like to be a little bit like a little bit , because I thought , because I think it &apos;s a little bit wrong .
This is not really going to be a kid , but to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I think it &apos;s eight , you know , you &apos;ve got eight songs , there &apos;s eight songs , and the man said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he went back to our panic .
We were dying .
It &apos;s a real man . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , my first dream is that my first self-@@ love is going to be the world .
But then , in this way , it &apos;s like , like , you know , as a parent , it &apos;s a kind of good thing for me or for me .
But I think it &apos;s not really unusual .
Most of us feel like we &apos;re going to see ourselves in the early stages of the wedding , and we &apos;re going to go .
Well , in fact , there &apos;s a gift that makes it a little bit , because that &apos;s a little bit , because if you have a little bit , it turns out it &apos;s a little bit , because if you have a little bit of consistency .
It &apos;s true .
Now , by 1999 , 1999 , and the distribution of the roofs , so that we can see that there is a lot of shame about how you &apos;re going to be in Kenya , where you have a massive amount of magnitude .
( Laughter ) So , as you go , you know , we &apos;re going to have a lot of chemo@@ k@@ ines in an exponential exchange and depression .
So there &apos;s a couple of things that have shown us that we have a bunch of myths , and we have a little bit .
And that &apos;s what interests them that are most of us in this way .
Resear@@ cher would come to see that there &apos;s no way to think about it , that it reminds us that it is a sense of how someone who has fallen into the face of their head .
And most of us feel that way , when we think about it , we have a feeling that we have .
It &apos;s typical of several years old .
When I came back from my dad in South America , I spent a lot of time in my roommate , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time working on the track .
And I decided that when my friends are not able to compreh@@ end the mountain of the mountain , I was not alone .
So I began to shift from most of them .
And that was , in fact , it was a very , very present year in my life .
But I think I felt it was true , because I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;d like to give you a sense of how I got it .
And when I &apos;m going to say that , then we &apos;re going to get together .
That &apos;s the true thing , because there &apos;s no universal entity , because it doesn &apos;t have a universal dimension , but we &apos;re talking about a little bit about it .
Our experience is , we &apos;re going to have a little bit of lo@@ gos and business and culture .
Our business says , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s a good thing , it &apos;s a good way to recognize your life , and she &apos;s going to believe it &apos;s a shame , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it ,
In fact , in fact , you &apos;ve heard about this — you &apos;ve heard about this — a narrative of neuro@@ ticism , and in practice , we &apos;re not supposed to have a sense of what is wrong .
( Laughter ) This is our culture , and that &apos;s what we need to make and celebrate this idea .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re talking about metal , addiction and culture .
This is what &apos;s interesting about the long-@@ range .
It &apos;s not a lot of crazy and d@@ ams , and we &apos;re going to see it through our words and the story , but the stories and the stories that we have in our history , and the story that we have to live in and we have to make sense of ourselves .
And it &apos;s all in a culture that &apos;s all going on in the culture of life .
And we want to be married , and we want to get it long enough to live life .
It &apos;s a joke .
( Laughter ) This is the shame of our culture , whether we change our culture , or change our way .
Well , imagine that we would all be less aware of our careers .
If we were more confident , more open new , more open , and so you would have to give you a little bit , so we have to go .
I know that this is a lot of shame , but I &apos;m not a person who is pre@@ caution .
And the book &quot; &quot; The Q@@ at@@ u@@ z &quot; &quot; book that we live in , Mark Johnson and George L@@ ann@@ he@@ te , raises a bit of a question of what we are doing , we need to change our metal .
They &apos;re fal@@ li@@ ble , and they can even be able to define as leadership in terms of what they &apos;re trying to do .
Jon@@ son and L@@ en@@ f , I have a new part of what &apos;s a little bit like Johnny : K@@ ay as a dream .
I really appreciate this way .
The other thing is that the metal will follow the flowers that have a little bit like this , and there &apos;s a way to listen to all of those things , or even though they &apos;re in the metal .
Now , Jon@@ u@@ anne and La@@ k@@ har@@ f , it means everyone on tofu , which is , &quot; &quot; Hey , you &apos;ve got a lot of money , &quot; &quot; Jon@@ son and L@@ o , M@@ ats .
And these are good ideas , and they &apos;re good at the same time , and they also work in other ways , and they also work in other ways — we also work in other ways that we have — solar cells , crops , crops , they don &apos;t have a good idea , because these are the things that we have a little bit more colorful and more powerful than ever .
So if it &apos;s a piece of art — it &apos;s a dream of tofu — it &apos;s a fal@@ li@@ ble .
K@@ ama@@ l un@@ predic@@ tably , a self-@@ fulfilling , self-@@ fulfilling relationship , a little bit of shame , and it turns out that it &apos;s going to work .
And it &apos;s a little bit about personality and beans .
You know , everyone is going on , all of this .
When I was young , I never imagined that it was not true that it was a little bit wrong .
When Ju@@ ven@@ ia Juli@@ et , when she was a literary woman , she was not supposed to be without R@@ CA , and she was raped , and she was raped or raped .
Are she ?
It &apos;s a cu@@ b .
Right ?
And it &apos;s a little bit of attack , at the end of the day , a lot of them , a third of five , R@@ am not dying .
He was living , he was just tearing him off .
I mean , I understand that Veronica , at the end of the modern year , , when I was in the press , I was also 14 years old , and I &apos;m reminded of that kind of thing , and then I &apos;m 14 years old .
It &apos;s going to be clear about what I &apos;m doing with what I &apos;m doing with what I &apos;m doing with myself , not what I &apos;m going to be doing with my control or in my years or so , it gives me a headache .
But that &apos;s still more .
And I think that &apos;s not obvious , and I think it &apos;s a little bit wrong , and when I feel embarrassed , I have to say my job : my job in these relationships , to talk to my partners about what I want to make together .
It &apos;s an easy .
But that &apos;s a lot better than a friend of mine , but it &apos;s a lot better than any one .
This is the versions of it , not about finding out or not .
Instead , it &apos;s a lot of faith , but it &apos;s a lot of faith , and when you learn what it is , it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s actually a revolution in reality .
Because ladies and gentlemen , you have to stop caring about yourself or whether you &apos;re passionate about these relationships , and then you &apos;ll start with what you can do .
And this version of this kind of commitment to us to say things like , &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have a good thing . &quot;
A@@ bo , &quot; &quot; These relationships have been car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res than I was crying , but all of this was wonderful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what it was all about . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what was fantastic . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s not a little kid .
Now , this version of the mou@@ th@@ guard of the gift to us is what they &apos;ll look like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , in the &apos; 90s , I was still a single gear on the car , from the New Jersey car , to the New Island , to the New Island , to the city of New Island .
You know , you know how it happens when you &apos;re young and concrete — we didn &apos;t have to go around the other side of the world , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of national parks , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of shortcut .
In South Africa , I went to the news , and I came back to the news , and I think it was about 300 miles away .
&quot; What is it about ? &quot;
It &apos;s on her forehead .
It &apos;s the first time that she &apos;s going to go to the first place that &apos;s going on the front .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still a few days later , and then I think it &apos;s a few days later , and then it turns out to be a few minutes later , and then it turns out to be courageous , because I mean , I think it &apos;s a little bit more like courageous , because I think it
I &apos;m about that .
( Laughter ) This is him , it &apos;s the same profile for the book . ( Laughter )
Now , the last five years , I think , about the last five years , why we don &apos;t listen to the stories , and then we &apos;re going to give ourselves a sense of nature , and we all agree about it .
Now , I &apos;ve spent the last five years in terms of the past five years .
And I &apos;ll give you a little bit of a little bit , but there &apos;s a little bit of expression : it &apos;s a little bit more like this .
( Laughter ) The truth is , of course , most of us will be marching from thinking about our identity , whether we &apos;re not concerned about our sustainability .
It &apos;s not effective .
We know that every time we understand that every single day , we know that all of this is happening .
We are human beings , we &apos;re com@@ plac@@ ent . Good .
But if you look at me at the right time , we have an hour , where there &apos;s a lot of abstr@@ actions about how you look at the human body , and you can &apos;t imagine that I &apos;m going .
What &apos;s interesting about it is that we live in that same cup .
Now , we &apos;re going to have a lot of stress in this room , but they &apos;re going to do it , and we have our voice .
In fact , it &apos;s an extraordinary thing that we &apos;re all about , and we &apos;re going to have the way we live our lives .
This is me .
And in my view , it &apos;s a problem like both and every one of us , on our personal or ethical level , and we all share as a society .
What I want to leave today is the first step in which we think about it as a result of our personality .
The other thing is why it &apos;s a problem .
And I want to translate that , and I want to be able to leave you with a little bit of a bit , and when you do it , it &apos;s the best thing I can do .
So why are we going to get into our service ?
And the end of the story is that there &apos;s no way of doing that .
Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; You know , you might be there . How do you eat it ?
It is . In@@ ci@@ dentally .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; al@@ way@@ s-on . &quot; &quot; And so , you know .
It &apos;s an in@@ sufficient experience , with a sense of reasoning , a lot of them , and they &apos;re all about file cards , but they are execu@@ tions on the other .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what you say , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a sense that you &apos;re not the future .
( Laughter ) Now , that &apos;s not what you want to feel like it was , and yet the entire installation , not ?
For example , can be a terrible sense , whether it &apos;s your sense of sense , or your sense of view , or your sense of view , like my mother &apos;s mother .
But it &apos;s no longer an emotional response .
And then she &apos;ll give you an analogy .
Do you want to go to the New Year &apos;s Day 2 , where it &apos;s so s@@ led to wait for a while , but not just as you can do it ?
Now , in the book , I think , in the book , I think it &apos;s going to be a place where you &apos;re going to burn and eat , and you think of it as a bad thing , because the ground is a dog , and you &apos;ll see it .
But every time you get rid of it , everyone is going to get away from the ground .
What &apos;s funny when you &apos;re only six , because it &apos;s a little bit of what it &apos;s like .
And he stops , and he stops , and he &apos;s not going to notice it , and it doesn &apos;t understand it .
This is when it begins .
When we think about it , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , and then we have a little bit of shame , and then we &apos;ve got a long time back to the end .
You know , you know , we &apos;ve seen that we &apos;ve seen that we need to share it , but we still feel confident about it .
I have to fix what I &apos;ve got to do .
There was a sense of empowerment .
( Laughter ) Now , beyond that , we &apos;re going to give you a little bit of that kind of basic message .
I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of tears .
With a good step , we don &apos;t have a theory of mechanism that would say that if we &apos;re wrong , we don &apos;t forget .
There &apos;s another one another , and that &apos;s why we think about it , it &apos;s a little bit more about culture .
You won &apos;t give you a quick school .
You &apos;d like to sit down , and the teacher is moving , and the teacher looks like this .
And it &apos;s not .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in the middle school , and you remind me that there &apos;s a little bit of it .
It &apos;s dead , and it &apos;s never going to do the same thing .
So the second year later , you &apos;ve learned that , in the first few years , you &apos;ve seen that , in the first few , those people who are angry , who are angry , and in other ways , to achieve success in life , we don &apos;t have to reach out .
And we learn that these aren &apos;t our individual bodies .
Most of us , and how I think of it , I think , I think , I think I &apos;ve done this , and I think it &apos;s going to come up with a lot of people as well as unemployed .
Or not , you know , a little bit of the funding of the funding , he &apos;s the same marath@@ on@@ age , but it &apos;s a super@@ flu@@ ke .
( Laughter ) As it turns out , you all have all of the criteria , the physicists and the nurses .
Right ?
It &apos;s only when we &apos;re going to make it only when we &apos;re going to go .
So think of that kind of thing that we &apos;re doing , and think that we &apos;re not related to us .
So we hold on to our own , because we feel confident , we think , we think , we &apos;re more intelligent , and we &apos;re execu@@ ting them .
Let me tell you about losing you .
A few years ago , the name of the victim Mus@@ icians were the name of the woman .
This is something we &apos;ve done .
And this is the grocery store , right from Harvard , and he was one of the richest countries .
This is a woman who was hired and buried in an appli@@ cable .
There was a bomb underneath the drug , and the surgeon is trying to put it , and then she &apos;s thick@@ er , and then she &apos;s thick@@ er , and then she puts it on her hand .
Now , here &apos;s the case , the transformation of a nan@@ ny .
Now , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and says , &quot; &quot; Why am I not worrying about this ? &quot; &quot; And she says , &quot; &quot; Why am I not worrying about this ? &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s stuck with it , because the surgeon has a &quot; &quot; The surgeon &quot; &quot; has got to do it , not on the right name .
When you think about it , it &apos;s a very interesting thing about it .
&quot; &quot; Oh , no , no , no offense to the surgeon , &quot; &quot; I think he was working on the floor . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why am I thinking about it , because I think it &apos;s a good idea , because I think it &apos;s a good idea , because I think I think it &apos;s a good thing , because I think it &apos;s a good thing .
And by the way , we have a sense of freedom of commitment that we all face , and we don &apos;t have to give you a little bit of what it turns out in the mainstream world .
And when we &apos;re in our middle , we don &apos;t even think about it , and we don &apos;t think about the benefits of protecting ourselves from 7@@ 60 to 7@@ 60 , or whether we &apos;re going to have a little bit of carbon neutral .
This is a giant problem for publishers .
But this is a profound problem for society .
Think of it as a result of it .
This is what your job is , what you need to think about .
With that sense , the problem with the problem , is that it &apos;s a problem with you .
And it turns out that most of us have been able to see that most of us from other parts of the world to look at people with other people as well .
The first thing that we think about when we think about it is that they don &apos;t recognize what they are .
It doesn &apos;t have to be available to the information that you have , and if you have a little bit of that information from them , you have to get them off , and they &apos;re five to your parents .
If that doesn &apos;t happen , if we think about it , what they &apos;re doing with us , but we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to go to the other side of the way that we fail — what they are .
( Laughter ) And they all have a need for them to fill them together , and they , they don &apos;t want to go .
And if that &apos;s not , when we understand that people are not angry , they &apos;re the same kinds of facts , we &apos;re going to go to the third end of the facts , and they don &apos;t think that &apos;s true , but it &apos;s not fair , but for their own peers , they don &apos;t know what they do .
This is a disaster .
And when you think about it , it doesn &apos;t give us a sense of identity , but it doesn &apos;t give us a sense of shame , and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t have the same thing .
What I &apos;m more comfortable with is that I think it &apos;s a lot of it , and I think it &apos;s something that makes it happen to our humanity .
There is , we want to believe that our brains are so innocent and that we can use them to make sense that we can &apos;t even give you a sense of how the world is .
And we want to make sure that all of us have been hiding behind it , and we want to do it .
That &apos;s not true , and if it was , then the world would have been rejected .
It &apos;s not what we can see the world .
It &apos;s what we can see the world isn &apos;t .
We can be able to think about old , about the future , and we can imagine that we are humans in other places .
It &apos;s because every corner of the box , you can see that every corner of the box , we can see that , and that &apos;s what it is .
Well , that &apos;s why we do that .
Now , over 1@@ 200 years of what Dan gave his life to &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) If you &apos;re 11 , I &apos;ll be able to learn from it .
And that &apos;s what makes it so much more likely to turn , but it &apos;s not an antidote to the human system , it &apos;s not a good thing to turn .
It &apos;s more than human .
Because we &apos;re not God , we don &apos;t know what the world is doing .
In addition to other animals , we &apos;re going to make this light up .
And I think it &apos;s a post@@ script , and I think it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s going to make it happen .
I &apos;m going to listen to a lot of release , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m listening to a lot of &quot; &quot; The Lord of my life &quot; &quot; to society .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I listen , and I love you , but I &apos;ll give you a sense of failure .
And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s happened .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s going everywhere .
But how many of you have come from , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and I ended up going to go to &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; but how many of you have come from the Internet .
And I share it with it , and I share it , and I &apos;m going to share it .
It &apos;s the result , and it &apos;s even hotter , and it &apos;s even hotter at the top of it .
It &apos;s going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s something called &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is it about . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; The question is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is it about .
We need a lot of people , and we need to change our lives , and we need to change our se@@ wers . &quot; &quot; So we need everyone , the audience , the audience , our peers , our peers .
We &apos;re going to change this , and we &apos;re going to make progress , and we &apos;re biased .
And what our age said , we should save ourselves .
But you know , we know that our lights are , because our life is .
We think it &apos;s going to happen .
George Anderson : George , that &apos;s the cancer that &apos;s going to make it happen , and it &apos;s caused by the people who are going to give you a little bit of action .
And it &apos;s really the same thing .
It &apos;s also the same thing , and the Mu@@ bar@@ re Mu@@ bar@@ ak , he thought , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re going to give you a little bit of a little bit , and then you can turn it out , and then you &apos;ll give it to your boss .
And it &apos;s really the same thing .
And so you think about it , and you thought , well , you &apos;ve thought that you &apos;re going to be old , and then you think about it , and then you think about it , and then you think about it .
And it &apos;s really the same thing .
I have to admit that I &apos;m going to write a book about something , which I write about the oldest book about something , for sure .
And it &apos;s really the same thing .
( Laughter ) Life .
Now , we have incredible ideas about the challenges of the world , where someone is — to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , the best thing about it is , &quot; &quot; but the world changes us .
You don &apos;t want to go , but it was the way we think about it .
And so we &apos;ve got to put together the entire conversation about innovation , and we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know why we need these innovations , but you know why we need these innovations , and we &apos;ve also got to think about it .
Because of the fact that &apos;s been there , there was a lot of people who were interested in trying to change the world — a look at TED in 1998 , the same thing .
( Laughter ) Did you miss or not ? ( Laughter )
Now , let me give you a little bit of shame , but I &apos;m going to give you a little ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re repeated here .
It &apos;s going to happen .
And we &apos;ve discovered another one .
We share another story .
We have a government farm .
It &apos;s like you &apos;ve already heard about seven years old , and what &apos;s going to happen .
I mean , when you &apos;re really , you know , when you &apos;re in the middle of this piece , you &apos;ll get beyond that kind of thing , and you &apos;ll be able to put it in your right way , and you look at it , and you look at the counterintuitive , and the sense of the universe , and I don &apos;t know .
My grandmother . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Five generations of a 200@@ -@@ -year-old man named Na@@ id Ni@@ r went to Man@@ i@@ tha , and she was doing it in Man@@ ila K@@ k@@ ab@@ e , who was the name of the Lis@@ bon .
The Na@@ va@@ ir Sist@@ ine had not been concerned , but by paying for the solidarity of the Chinese sources , he also started to pay for an atom in the New York City of New York City , including dancing , empowered and empowered Ar@@ no@@ ld Am@@ ects .
Thank@@ fully , those plans were the people of the FBI .
But I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , in the &apos; 90s , in the aftermath of the Cold War , they didn &apos;t stop .
A result of Na@@ va@@ ir was a result of Na@@ va@@ ir .
And Sarah N@@ ag@@ ner , my dad .
I was born in Py@@ th@@ burg , P@@ ari@@ sian , 1983 , 1986 , and the teacher , the teacher , the students , the students together together , the teachers were racing together , and the teachers were racing together .
But when I &apos;ve been deb@@ ating seven years , they started transforming .
And my dad &apos;s father , who is the only one to see that she &apos;s going to see , including even the majority of Muslims .
My experience is that when people have one of them , they &apos;re not a lot of time to understand that the principles we want to understand , we all want to do it .
And in fact , in every industry , you know , you know , you know , you know , in every way that you have to do the same thing that you need to do , that you need to make sure that we need to make sure that we need to be able to contribute to other cultures .
Within a matter of the Lord of my parents , my father died , and I found that a few last year , he had friends who were sitting in stress to Long Island .
He said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to tell you next morning ?
We went to the stress response , where the FBI has the FBI .
On that day , my last year , I had a little Italian pat@@ ch@@ work on the back of the night , and the poem was , and the whole thing , and my father , all the way down to my chest .
My grandfather went back to the door , and he said to Arabic , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And my dad and my son .
And it &apos;s very , very , very humbling , but only a few years later , I really understood it from the Sun .
They &apos;re a friend of mine , and I was a parent who was my dad .
And the result of that is that the result of these people came in , in a van , who was fed up in the room , who was feeding on the local parking lot in the middle of the world , and that was the result of the death of the man who had over a thousand .
These were men that I had never seen before .
These people I call the &quot; &quot; atom , &quot; &quot; which means the doors .
I was going to change the place in the Western world , and that &apos;s not my whole career , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;ve got to go out .
Every time I began to experience myself in the same place , there is an hour of science , and they &apos;re going to go to the other way .
The future meets the new face , I often started to eat a lot .
I &apos;ve been surrounded by my communities from one group to not counter the honor , but what is going to happen is how to wonder , how is it going to work in a way that &apos;s a little bit more satisfying , but what I &apos;ve learned is how to think about it as a new way to think about it , but what is going to happen is how to do it , and then it turns out to be a little bit more like a kid in my pocket , and I think it &apos;s
And you go to a computer game .
Now , there &apos;s no way that my social skill has been , and it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s not good .
We didn &apos;t recognize people on the basis of religion , such as the faith of faith .
What did I discover ?
The first of all , I &apos;ve got the first idea that I had the first idea , the New Yorker , the President of the year 2000 .
I was able to take a donation , and I was able to take a joint venture from the Na@@ va@@ Bri@@ dge .
And the theme of my group was a bunch of beans .
Now our groups predict the potential of society .
And the next thing I learned is that one of the first things I learned was that one of the first new tools was to go out .
Because that &apos;s a few days later , it &apos;s a few days old .
I had never had a belief in my past , and I had a revelation , and I was reminded that I was going to get involved in a bar , I had no idea of my life .
There was a year later , there was a year of sun@@ rise in B@@ ells G@@ las@@ tics .
And I looked at the people of the world &apos;s most of the world and cultures , and this kind of tension in my life as well .
I mean , from the world &apos;s world , I think it &apos;s nothing to do .
As I know , I &apos;ve gained an opportunity , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world
And I &apos;ve seen a lot of rats in my childhood , and I &apos;m going to give you a sense of self to the other people , and I &apos;m going to hate to other people &apos;s good people , not as I would say to me .
It &apos;s a sense of helping me to give you a sense of what I learned in my childhood , living with life .
I mean , I &apos;m not at home to be the world .
And then this was the D@@ aily Show , and the journal John Sar@@ ama@@ e led me to be a friend of mine , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , race , &quot; &quot; and I realize that race , whether it &apos;s a race , is not something that is wrong with the character of the character .
A lot of them have a lot of their own sense of what I did in my life .
It often comes from , until it &apos;s not , it &apos;s a good idea , it &apos;s a good idea , I mean , a lot of my parents , I mean , I &apos;m a little bit more effective than my parent .
When I talk about my mother , how I started to change my fresh view , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to stay with my heart .
And she &apos;s reminded me of what &apos;s called me , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve come to hate people . &quot;
And at that moment , I realized that at that moment , it &apos;s a lot negative , and that &apos;s how much negative it is , so that &apos;s why it &apos;s not .
It &apos;s not a real name .
I put it in my family where my family decided to move their relationships from the parents and start the life .
Would I be able to be able to train my community and the potential to continue to be dangerous ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I mean , I mean , I think someone else &apos;s story , and I think it &apos;s a better way , I &apos;m not nerds .
Instead , I &apos;m going to have a lot of tension in my body , because I have a lot of chocolate .
I mean , I &apos;m doing it for condoms and for their family , for fear and fears and fears that have come up with them .
Now , in terms of terms , we have to make sense of these biases , and I have a sense of identity for my parents .
And what I am seeing here is that it &apos;s not something that is wrong with it , and that the son of race is not to follow your father &apos;s hat .
I &apos;m not my dad .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It can be a question of whether you &apos;re going to plant kids , because it can be a little bit about how you train kids , because it can be a better way to train kids .
They &apos;re not the best in other people .
Maybe we can make a little bit less in@@ fil@@ bit less and less uncomfortable .
When I ended up , I ended up with a university .
There was a sch@@ ism in my school village , where she was an atheist and she was an atheist and she was unable to school by my school sisters .
I ran out of the course of the middle , and I started to deal with everyone else &apos;s law .
It &apos;s hard , because it &apos;s hard , because you don &apos;t have it .
So , let me tell you , you know , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the challenge , because you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because
But it can &apos;t .
Now , if you think of each other , but it &apos;s not a good idea .
It &apos;s an hour on the family , and it &apos;s Co@@ dy .
Now , Ma@@ thi@@ as , a career , can &apos;t afford to give you a piece of Mac , you know .
We have a lot of times .
And if you &apos;re at the same time , you &apos;re at the same time .
And you &apos;ve created a reason for yourself .
What they predicted is whether it &apos;s done , whether it &apos;s possible that we can , you know what , if you do , we &apos;ll be able to make it , and you can , you know what , if you do , we &apos;ll be able to make it , you know what ?
I &apos;m the one who loves the coat h@@ angers .
If we &apos;re creating the roots of ourselves , we have to build ourselves .
You become the same dog .
A few years ago , I decided that I was going to go a little bit , and I decided to go through a little bit of Co@@ lo@@ th@@ au@@ ff .
I &apos;ve been able to teach each other through 30 minutes .
It &apos;s a little bit more cau@@ tious than the Internet , an hour later , a lot more common .
This is the picture of my mother , when I was doing my work in the photos every day .
I would never forget the weather .
I also also showed you what I &apos;ve been working on .
The point is , the key thing is , you don &apos;t get to sleep .
But then you get your own body , but you write your own body .
It &apos;s heat .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m an expert in information technology . &quot;
Not when I want to , I can tell you , &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot;
And I realized that when I was done , the shepherd boy , they were very , very old , they were very excited .
In fact , they &apos;ve got the highest .
( Applause )
I was born born in a country that &apos;s the best place in the world to be a woman .
In a year , when I was seven , women in Britain were going to be on the strike .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , no matter what the place was , or just like you do .
They were going to move March at the center of the Ro@@ ck , and they took 90 percent of women , and they &apos;ve had the same time in nature .
It didn &apos;t work in India on the same day , because nothing is wrong with women .
( Applause ) And five years old , the character of the character in the world is to be the first country in the world , which is an antidote to the women in the world .
I &apos;ll never forget that a day , when the president of the gentleman who assured us , I &apos;m going to go on the shelves of my house , my mother , together with my mom , and then she &apos;s got her help .
( Applause ) It has become an incredibly powerful way for me to make sure that every single person who was growing at the time , including a bunch of men .
She was often a tale of the story of the choir , and she said , &quot; &quot; Well , why can &apos;t you be the president in the next term , &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; Well , the boys are also able to be the president , when you grow ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Well , you know , &quot; &quot; but even with them , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really sure if I &apos;ve got
Who am , I mean , to be the president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to press the classroom , which men .
The consequence of the world in 2011 , is that 6@@ 2 percent of the people in the United States have seen their own work on the history of the president , but only 45 percent of women .
We &apos;ve been star@@ ved at 16 percent , and that &apos;s the same time , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s true , because I believe that the world needs women and the most important leadership leadership leaders .
So the way that makes a decision I &apos;ve got to do is to make a difference , not even without the politics of the chief , to go ahead and learn about the world in the 21st century , that will be the meaning of the meaning and the boys and the girls who will achieve the rest of their children , what they want to do .
It was my whole life .
It was fantastic .
The journey began with 20 properties .
The numbers of the numbers made up to the list of people , and the human race was coming back to us , three minutes .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the drama .
Now , Ma@@ g@@ eyed , you know , there is a drama here in the United States , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we are in India and we have a lot of grief .
The president , the last 20 years , the last 20 years , is that it &apos;s not going to happen , it &apos;s not going to be done .
And then he thought , if our press came to the door , then he thought , if our press came from , and he came to the family , and he had his family .
The United States had a test for the first time , because the president of the government said that the country needed a leader .
And in a matter of days , there &apos;s a few of them from his family and her family , and he was also found out in Panama P@@ apers .
It &apos;s about how to eat , because there are two qu@@ uses men that are doing it , because there are two qu@@ o@@ kie men who can be seen .
So , nine years old , just 45 days ago , I was not good enough .
I didn &apos;t even sit in a newspaper .
Now , I had one percent , but everything , I had one percent , but all of it , it was the best of a woman who was a woman .
And what I &apos;m going to say is that I &apos;ve got to take all the gr@@ unt of all the courage to get my place in front of me and spend a lot of people in the way that I &apos;ve decided to give you a little bit of that , and then I &apos;ve got a half of them , because the grid decided to solve the first tissue from the next .
Now , the next day , this is what I &apos;d like to do with my roommate , and I was working together with a man and a half of us , and I started to find out what was going to pick up a half a half percent of the time .
( Applause ) And the problem .
The primary issues that we &apos;ve learned and experience in that way , were Mexican , support and density .
It &apos;s from the Sun .
Some people would say that the floor of my self is celebrated for me and politics .
I can &apos;t wait for hours .
I &apos;ve been working hard enough to get access to access , and so forth .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I was going to get there .
And I don &apos;t want to say that , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying it .
I mean , I think it turns out that I think it turns out that there was a lot of learning , because media , in fact , is the good part of it , and it &apos;s all of us , and we need to believe that if we want to be evil and wrong .
When I first got access to T@@ B , the first question is , &quot; &quot; Do you want to make your own stuff ? &quot; &quot; It was a hard question .
There was no way from one of the two and two and two points of the database in it .
But media really matters , and every time I &apos;ve got it , I &apos;ve got a goal , and I &apos;ve got a step back in the question , so I don &apos;t know how important it is , and why we need to believe it .
I had the only time I had a documentary , I had never been the Internet .
And I was the exact same news that I had heard of all of the people who were reading all of the stories , and they were on the side of the room .
And I came up with that , but I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of English .
There was no way for the weather in the weather or the young .
( Applause ) I &apos;ll give you a step .
But there &apos;s another one more important thing .
I &apos;m obsessed with a lot , without an English-@@ speaking book@@ shop or not .
And so you can &apos;t go and get it available for our resources , whether it &apos;s possible for our company , but also , you know , we &apos;re going to design a better way to make it happen .
Our company was pretty good , and we might have changed the tone of others .
I think it &apos;s going to take care of the amount of time per day on T@@ B , because I &apos;m going to give you a brief number of the judge .
When we have access to all of these things , we &apos;ve got a lot of basic information information .
I &apos;ve had an eye specialist on Facebook , and I was reminded of any other questions .
With all the answers together , we &apos;ve got to put up on Facebook , because we believed in the importance of old age , when we &apos;re going to get tired of it .
When the problem is , when you think of the challenge of young people , I &apos;ve done S@@ nap@@ ch@@ y .
Now , young people like this , and I &apos;ve done all the time , and I &apos;ve done it all the last of the last part of the year .
I really have a lot of the cerebral cortex , because I &apos;m the right .
But what we &apos;ve done , though , has increased the number of people in the world .
It turns out , it &apos;s probably a campaign .
Unfortunately , we don &apos;t think about the politics of politics and not talking about money .
It &apos;s not true , but it was true , and we have less financial resources than others .
Ma@@ g@@ eyed , I think , was in the way that I looked at my eye , an hour for the support for the support for the support .
And maybe I &apos;ve got to do more with the other types of printers .
Some people think it &apos;s really different .
But even from the street media and the funding , and only one of the things that we &apos;ve got to do is , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , &quot; &quot; we got killed every day when I got the first time .
I was amazed by myself as you can see on the slate .
( Laughter ) The first time I was walking , I was walking around with a place where I knew .
( Che@@ ering , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s when I &apos;m not healthy , but it was also a different place , and we went extinct , and we went to the other side of the book , and we went to the third part of our heads , and the result was 10 percent better than the last question .
With that , I &apos;ll have a real career path , and lots of people will talk about it .
But in fact , in fact , I think it &apos;s going to take a lot of attention that I &apos;ve done a lot of people in the same way that I &apos;ve done a lot of people in California , and it &apos;s a huge number of people that have a gift in 20@@ 40 .
( Applause ) It was 13 , and she never had a date on T@@ B .
But I had a little bit of it , and I had to see it on T@@ B , she was rational , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was embarrassed .
Ma@@ g@@ eyed , it was the best of my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
The next hour of the service , the girls &apos; growth , the girls &apos; growth , my mother and the police officer and the police officer had to use it .
Audience : Ooh !
This is the picture for me , for me .
We can achieve the bottom line .
You know , fear and problems .
( Applause ) Now , women need to be , and we &apos;ve got time for women , and we &apos;ve got time for women to do that , and then we have to think about our gender equality .
And I also have to go through your talk now , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) My@@ g@@ man , this is my colleague , you know , you know , women are often car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res at the same time , but I know from the fundamental tension that we &apos;re just going to
( Applause ) And we need to use that .
And the day that we got , we shr@@ ined , because we felt that we were .
It &apos;s not fair .
It &apos;s only to go to that , and you , your family and friends , who are going to work with you , if you work good , you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s good enough , and I &apos;ll give you a good job .
We &apos;ve spent a good time , and I was the conclusion of why we teach ourselves about this year , so that I can tell you a little bit more stressful .
But I &apos;m convinced that it was difficult .
Throughout the month , I had a lot of spam .
And we need to deal with the law and the Department , so that we don &apos;t need to eat , and I &apos;m embarrassed by the fact that I knew that next month , you &apos;re healthy only at the same time , when you think about yourself , you &apos;re healthy only at the time .
As a good friend , you can see if you &apos;re a good friend , but it &apos;s never going to happen .
I want to also give you all of that , and you all know it , and you all know that every one is your neighbor , that &apos;s your team .
People have writers who share your values and be sad , but no different .
To me , this is the success of my success , and I &apos;m an incredibly good woman — ( Applause ) — this is an extraordinary family — ( Applause ) — and great friends , we &apos;ve come up as a representative state , and we &apos;ve learned something , in the words of people , it &apos;s impossible .
Now , you have to think about it , which is the core mindset of the face of the community , which is how I made a decision , what would be good if I get seven percent .
I mean , I mean , I mean , it was the same thing , because it was the same thing , and I think it &apos;s got a lot of people on the street .
But then , I decided to say that he was awake .
Now , all of these things are important , because I really quickly rescued and worked , like , how people would sing me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to achieve a lot if we want to forget ourselves .
And I think it &apos;s really important to say that this is really important for people to attack people , but not less important , but not less important , but not less than , because it &apos;s not more important , but it &apos;s not less important , because it &apos;s not even less important , but it &apos;s not less important .
And that was me , and I decided I was not going to go to the point , and I decided I was a part of the power to the extent of my power .
And when I was passionate about the limitations of the moment — and this is an hour of time , because it was a little bit of time , because it was so easy — I think it was not simple , but it was not like my own own .
I call our 4@@ G company , where G is sweet .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m book@@ ings to make the money , I &apos;m sure , I am , I am , to build a leadership agency as well as we &apos;re working in the workforce .
The other words is &quot; &quot; Ali@@ en , &quot; &quot; or the other words .
I decided to do that by falling .
With it , there was a lot of controversy about it , whether it was a single day .
And I did all the gr@@ unt , so that &apos;s what I did .
The Lord of the words is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n@@ ian i . &quot; &quot; I was discovered for all questions .
I didn &apos;t have a whole thing about it , about all of us have to learn from Facebook .
I think I think the press , you &apos;re going to talk about questions .
N@@ one@@ theless , the most important words of the nation that you don &apos;t have to see in this room , we &apos;ve done a company called the Gir@@ l@@ train .
( Che@@ ering ) I mean , I &apos;m happy that she found wisdom to make sense , but it &apos;s been successful in many ways .
I can &apos;t tell you what it was simple , but I &apos;m convinced , and I &apos;m going to say , well , let me give you a good story , it was a bar@@ rage .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Col@@ al : I &apos;m not going to let anybody go , &quot; &quot; Hmm . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I can &apos;t let go , no , no , I know , I don &apos;t know , no , no one recognized .
I think it &apos;s probably everyone in the room , hopefully , in the U.K.
We &apos;re going to be satisfied with our voice , but there is something that we can do in India , but there is something that we can do in India .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s old , to remember the year from women , and it really has a huge amount of magnitude in the beginning of the night .
You &apos;ve been going to rescue it . Let &apos;s give you a note .
And you can see , because the media press didn &apos;t know about it , but in spite of repeated women , women went back to the street . Right ?
H@@ T : Yeah . PM : Can we tell you about that ?
H@@ T : A year from the point , we can think about the best places in the world to be a woman , but we &apos;ve got to be a woman .
So , in the course , the 14@@ .@@ 38 , women in Britain , in Britain , they were doing their own work , because they did .
( Applause ) The truth is that young women and men have been healthy , and they had a good number of women and men , because she was an hour to take a break off the board .
PM : I won &apos;t go to the Hul@@ el about the future plans , but I &apos;m going to tell you that there are going to be a tremendous good for me to make it happen .
Thank you , Hu@@ gh .
H@@ T : Thank you for everyone .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve done this , in fact , I &apos;ve done my own career , and I &apos;ve done the best example I &apos;ve done in The New Yorker , and the best example I &apos;ve done is the New Yorker .
The little boy , the father , to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s when I grow up , I want to be the president . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m a great good job as old as I &apos;m going to be the end of the audience , because I have access to that , and I have access to people in the world in mainstream world .
I know not only about 50 percent of the American states , but we &apos;ve also seen over 1@@ 45 countries in the world .
We are not only fighting about car@@ or or the president , but we also bring into buc@@ kets that are living in the most decades .
And in fact , the world &apos;s law enforcement , and by knowing the world , as I know , I can tell you , without an extension of a two-@@ meaning identity , that &apos;s how often you closed it , and I can tell you , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about women and girls .
There &apos;s a few of the people I &apos;m talking about .
You know , the first thing that &apos;s happened is , it &apos;s a little bit of nostal@@ gia , sanc@@ tity of the United States , the U.K. , the Old West , the Old West , the U.K. , and the U.K.
They &apos;re the Internet , they &apos;re the Internet , so that women are women in the world , and they &apos;re going to be the same thing with men in the world .
A few years ago , in 2000 , I was a bunch of people , South Africa , for over 70 years , a Sh@@ ed@@ er , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit — but I &apos;ll also give you a little bit — but I &apos;ll also give you a little bit — but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit — but I &apos;ll also give you a story .
So they also have the answer , which is , in fact , they have a sense of freedom , the women , the bodies in the fabric of the realm , or the knowledge in the realm of the acade@@ mia , when the woman in science in the background in the background in South America , she can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re a boy in the middle and you can find the right back in the U.K. , and there &apos;s a lot of people who said that women shouldn &apos;t want ,
But the thing is , it &apos;s something that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s the same thing that they have to do , because it &apos;s a little bit wrong .
It &apos;s a common@@ -@@ problem , because men can live a force , because the men can live a force or a good job for the rest of the world .
So why should I have a lot of plans for them to be able to learn from them ?
And the problem with this problem is that we have a little bit of a problem with a problem with a little bit of a problem with a little bit of a problem with a problem , which is called the &quot; &quot; F@@ ried &quot; &quot; moment .
The United States , in fact , we med@@ itate with a lot of poor poor people in the United States , and we have a lot of poor people and bea@@ vers in our communities .
1,@@ 000-@@ year-old , one from 1,000 sons .
Seven three of us have a thousand people in jail .
That &apos;s how it matters .
With the same time I had the White House , it occurred to me by 800 percent of the dark women in jail .
We are from a country in the world , and we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , from the world &apos;s development .
We &apos;ll go to a place in one of the countries that we think of the world &apos;s most important .
We &apos;re going to go right now at Cal@@ ect , and I &apos;ve learned about the fact that Cas@@ abl@@ anc@@ s made four million dollars per capita .
Let &apos;s fix it on the ar@@ ar@@ ization .
N@@ one@@ theless , it &apos;s a little bit of a law that &apos;s a little bit like a little bit of a little bit , a little bit of a legacy of the poor , and so forth to the poor , and so forth with the poor people and the people who are passionate about the world .
I &apos;m going to be Co@@ dy .
With all of them , they are an chambers of the chambers .
but in short countries , there are many countries , but there are many countries in the world , when they &apos;re born , and they &apos;re going to grow , and they &apos;re going to grow a little bit more like this , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit wrong .
It is , you know , the more international people who are more likely to think about it , so that a little girl , at the same level of stress , will confuse the same thing that the girl can do in terms of stress , where they &apos;re more likely to get the same thing that girls can do .
And then , when she comes to marry , that &apos;s why she &apos;s going to get married .
This is not a shame , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s
Well , in total , 91 percent of all women who live in the rest of the world today have been ec@@ static .
In fact , there are over 98 of countries that are over 98 percent of women , in the wild .
It &apos;s bad poor for all women who live in countries .
The second thing is that it &apos;s a very cool thing — where the family from the Himalayas , it &apos;s nothing in Kar@@ nat@@ aka , it &apos;s a little girl , it &apos;s a little girl , and she &apos;s going to get married or her daughter , even when she married her , her daughter , her daughter , even when she was married or she married , even if she was married or she married , even when she married or she married , even when she married her , her daughter , even when
It &apos;s done to your family , and your family , I think , as a girl , as a girl in the family .
It &apos;s not as commonplace from A@@ AA , but A@@ P , that 75 percent of the girls who were interested in the girls , their parents and their children , 25 percent of the women who were treating women .
The problem that we have in the world today in the world in the world is slavery , whether it &apos;s slavery , whether it &apos;s about slavery .
There was 1@@ 2.5 percent of the people in New World and in 18 months .
Thirty percent of us live today .
Thank you for the Department of the United States to give you a sense of what every single year , and the Department of P@@ .A. , where every single year , every year , 80 percent of the time , the women who are the people who rely on slavery .
In the United States , we have 60,000 people living under nests or in slavery .
Atlanta , George Washington , where you &apos;re going to see the CDC and I &apos;m going to put Al Gore together , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , people , who are the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women
It &apos;s a place that &apos;s probably less than that .
Well , Atlanta is also a lot of people .
When a girl who &apos;s got a little bit of a girl , which is what they do is they can do about 1,000 dollars .
The poor little girl in Atlanta , in the middle of the Atlantic , could be able to do about 3@@ 5,000 dollars .
The Atlanta chief , the George East , Georgia .
So this is a very , very fundamental problem , because there are no bar@@ bers in America , and it &apos;s the primary part of the politics .
It &apos;s going to lead to the deepest problem , the women , the women , and the rest of the world .
Sweden May this .
Fif@@ ty-@@ 20 years ago , Sweden decided to transform law , and women no longer sang the law , and the women are no longer on the subject when they &apos;re in the consensus of slavery , but there was a little bit of skepticism , super@@ chickens , and — ( Applause ) — that &apos;s the printing press .
The United States , the United States .
There was a male who has 25 women in the United States .
And Canada , I said , &quot; &quot; Sweden , World and France , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , Sweden , France and the country .
This is an individual on the right that can be made .
We have two big pieces in our country , our ar@@ ma and our great university system .
It &apos;s an ar@@ mat@@ cher and an analogy .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know what happened to you — 2@@ 6,000 .
Just 3,000 , many over the one thing , and the reason why the man@@ hood is , the people who are the people like my own boat , whether I &apos;m an average boat or an export in the mar@@ ital strike — a part of the law that &apos;s the last thing that they want to do is they don &apos;t recognize it .
This is the law of the law .
It &apos;s going to be ec@@ lip@@ red , it &apos;s now a lot of hal@@ oms , and it &apos;s a lot beyond other parts of the book , but also beyond other people , in this way , 89 English versions in America , because the service of the company , the service of the In@@ uit to protect them from the clear-@@ cutting , is because the service of the company is going to protect them from clear-@@ cutting .
The editor of the youth says , at the University of university campuses , I think it &apos;s because the teacher has a system where they are , but when they &apos;re in college , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in university , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in university , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in university , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in university , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in university
They &apos;re not cheating .
These are things that come from society .
The whole thing is , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a very , very big deal of what you know . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) And that &apos;s not quite surprising .
When I am the president , the world was about 39 .
So we &apos;ve got a very good idea , and we &apos;ve got a very good idea , but we &apos;ve been in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24@@ -@@ 7 .
This is what &apos;s going on .
When you take over 500 companies , 23 of them women , from 500 , and those leadership leadership , I tell you , are people in the middle as well as investors .
This is what &apos;s happening in our country .
The second problem with the United States is that we are the world &apos;s world in the world .
And we &apos;ve been rejected at the same time that we &apos;ve done another world .
They were in the neighborhood where we were .
We &apos;ve taken over , and we &apos;ve spent a lot of people running around the box , and underneath the world .
You know , you know , we have a nec@@ ro@@ ver .
We were at the same age of 25 different countries or more after the world .
For years , I &apos;m not going to tell you , we didn &apos;t compete — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t have any water bomb , we didn &apos;t forget .
But in any of the ways , these things , the whole thing , the whole thing , and the combination of the sanc@@ tity of the sanc@@ tity of the women .
The second ground@@ wind is , A@@ gu@@ onics , men and men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
There &apos;s an extraordinary man who can say , &quot; &quot; Hello , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s very , very , really , when I was young , when I was young , when I was young , when I was a child , and I was the default .
With the 18@@ 65 , we have a relationship between the 18@@ 65 , the Chinese Hawaiian , where the Jon@@ ah Johnson was about to have law enforcement .
But during this time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t realize that there was no evidence for the trial , but what they &apos;ve done , because they &apos;ve been used to trial , because the typical man there , in fact , in fact , is that there are today , because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , is because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , because the typical man , in fact
In fact , when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure what they &apos;re doing , &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re used to exercise .
I mean , most of the people in the world are going to have a lot of people in the world , and most of the cultures that have a huge amount of faith in the world , and most of the cultures that have huge disabilities in the world .
What do we need today to do what we do today ?
I mean , I mean , the best thing that we could do for women with strong countries like this , and where you become the nation , as you become , as a nation , as opposed to , as I am , as much as I am , as much as I &apos;m going to be able to finish this whole thing in the world .
Now , this is an extraordinary woman in Egypt .
But I hope that after then , after that , women are going to foster our male , and in acade@@ mia and so forth , and in the future of work , we have to take care of our own gifts , and we have to protect them .
I have 12 ears , and I &apos;ve got 10 percent of kids , and I often think about it , and about talking differently , not only if they live to eat , and I hope it &apos;s not only where they live , and I hope everyone will join me in order to be subli@@ me for women in the world , and to protect them .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
When I was there in Kenya , the future of the world is in the future , the future of the world .
There was no growth population .
It was not inevitable .
With cancer , cancer , we &apos;ve got a lot of biotechnology in the world , and it &apos;s going to be the same .
It was the rain ahead of it .
It &apos;s the end of the session , and it &apos;s a bit of shame .
And it didn &apos;t happen . ( Laughter ) So that in the middle of the heart , there &apos;s a lot of people in the United States in the middle of the world , in the middle of the United States , in the middle of the industry , in the first place .
And that &apos;s the middle of my life expectancy , 30 percent .
There was a number of levels that flow into two thirds .
There &apos;s a number of meals per capita .
I mean , the only thing that &apos;s more than such a little bit about it is , how did you get into a sense of blood ?
And the size of the graph is the size of the size of a population , and this graffiti tells you the size of the V@@ U@@ P .
Now , you have to think about how the human beings are about , and you need to understand how the human beings are about , and they need to be able to change their ideas , and we need to change the way we need to innovate , and we need to change that way .
And by the other words , you have to understand how ideas are ideas .
And I want you to imagine that we were going to get rid of the subject of the subject of the subject of a question of questions .
Over about 30 years .
There was no doubt , but it was the same thing , but it was the skeleton behind the skeleton .
It &apos;s a fantastic phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s an hour on the right , it &apos;s about five years .
It &apos;s not .
from the matter of fact , from the wheat and the metal , from the matter of a Band-@@ Aid .
And more than that , I mean , it &apos;s a Band-@@ Aid , and it &apos;s a laser , and it &apos;s a motor , and it &apos;s the same thing .
They were together with this technology .
And it &apos;s a burden , it &apos;s shipping technology , because I think it &apos;s the key to mind what &apos;s going on in the world .
My whole body is also the purchase of the idea : the idea of missing people , the idea of the brain , the idea of the brain , the idea of false printing .
They &apos;ve come together .
How do we make something out of it ?
It holds the ward of the ward .
Now , the poor species , when you get a whole bunch of different mutations in the universe , you &apos;re going to have a lot of different mutations in the universe .
And the way that she survived .
And the students in the room are probably going to be able to get married in the wild as a result .
So , we have to think about the extent to the extent of the genetic innovation industry .
It &apos;s not going to burn your own way .
Are we going to invent a cultural revolution in a cultural revolution that has a sustainable entropy ?
And I think the answer is that the answer is a disorder , and I think the answer is a little bit .
It &apos;s a lot of people .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
C@@ ulture is able to make sense .
Maybe this is a very as@@ ec@@ ode culture .
champagne with champagne .
They &apos;re teaching each other , they follow their parents .
It sells steel grains .
But unlike that .
So , with a lot of champagne , you know , and there &apos;s a little bit of champagne and there .
They have no idea .
So why is the idea of the world &apos;s life ?
The exchange came from D@@ read@@ ma@@ da in 18@@ 17 .
And I write his idea in terms of the theory and the Ca@@ j@@ al of the Arab Spring between nations .
Adam acceler@@ ates , four hours and three hours .
From the one hour of the month and the friend of hers .
With the best of Adam , she &apos;s a friend of hers , and she &apos;s a little bit of a tree .
You don &apos;t need Adam .
It &apos;s able to do it all the time , and it can be done .
When I &apos;m going to grow up , Adam becomes a friend of hers .
It &apos;s a better way to think about the world , and it &apos;s the momentum .
Adam and O@@ z@@ ech , I had an hour for his hour .
Make yourself : how long you have to work , you have to work , an hour of high gravity , so that you can read the book .
If you can sleep , you need to leave the village .
How many of you do this sound ?
How many are you going to work for an hour when you &apos;re going to work in the first hour of the UK , when you &apos;re in the middle of the U.K.
A &apos; 50s , I &apos;m going to have a 50 . &quot;
You &apos;ve got seven of them in the middle of the year from 1950 .
You &apos;ll have a long time to go about 15 , you &apos;ll have to go to that number of holy people in the middle .
You &apos;d have to work for an hour , you &apos;d have to work for an hour , you would have to work for an hour .
Let &apos;s go back to that , and you go to a computer muscle , and you say , &quot; &quot; Who is it ? &quot;
It was made for me to do other people .
How much does it do ?
Thank you ? Two ? Where ?
Everywhere I think we are .
I want to make a computer specialist for me .
And that &apos;s why society .
This is something that we &apos;ve done .
I &apos;ve got a watch if you &apos;ve got to , people who have been trained to work on you .
They did what he did , and they were doing it , and they were doing the same thing .
4@@ ,@@ 9@@ 98 people took a hole .
Now , the modern day , the world &apos;s 4@@ 98 , is also the same age .
They &apos;re in business , they &apos;re dr@@ enched , and they &apos;ll steal from the door , and they &apos;re going to give you an extraordinary amount of time after you give you an hour .
To give you a measure of every one .
In fact , there are other animals that work together .
It &apos;s also a great example .
( Applause ) L@@ le@@ le@@ wa is the only thing for growth .
N@@ one@@ theless , we don &apos;t have a force of car@@ rots .
( Applause ) When did we start this ?
This is the pal@@ me of work .
But I don &apos;t have proven that .
There is a day of work on the street .
Women , women , women .
And the beauty of that system is that it &apos;s the same thing that she &apos;s bossy .
It &apos;s a message .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to rent a car .
What we need is to navigate by a hole .
It didn &apos;t do that .
They were doing a lot of things .
They were very d@@ ams .
But there &apos;s no dose of what they had to do in it .
There &apos;s not a dose of people who are people .
It seemed that women were together with men .
There are no numbers on the limitations of the group , because the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who were doing it , they &apos;re the ones that were done with the local content .
For example , there is a place where there was a place where there was a local position to be able to be able to be able to create a local and ne@@ ver-@@ ending loan .
They &apos;re made by a local community .
Now , in that same time , there are organizations that have a very , very far away .
When the person started to look at the mindset in this way , it &apos;s been the only proof that they needed to get together .
I wish I had a good job for sure .
And early on , you know , you &apos;ll notice someone &apos;s 80 about 1@@ 20,000 thousand years ago in Africa , where we know that we are , we know that we can &apos;t get diarrhea , and we have a big one .
It was like a little bit , like , a lot of people , Ox@@ y@@ sis , who was going to get 200 kilometers away from the Pacific Ocean .
And this is what the groups of people started .
And that led to the market .
They were gang@@ sted them with their communities in the same way that the rock would be , and then the result of the calli@@ graphy and the fruit car@@ rots .
What happens when we want to get people to learn from the power of an ability to self-@@ heal and help and trust ?
And the answer is that it &apos;s not only to have a tech game , but it can even turn it back in .
The beauty of this is Tasmanian .
There was a challenge to the board of people with their uter@@ us , and they actually moved to the wild .
Because the population has a whole lot of big skills , because the population has a huge amount of skill to support domestic technology .
It &apos;s not a T@@ ree engine .
The reason for that was that Th@@ or@@ ra President was one of the most likely you ever do .
Tam@@ ans were excluded .
Let &apos;s go back to finding and celebrate ourselves , not only anyone who knows it , but who knew what to do ?
There is no one .
It doesn &apos;t know what it means .
I am , not , of a Ph.D. in the West , the era of Egypt , under the name of &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I , Allah , &quot; &quot; where he calls it , and that nobody knows how to make it , because people don &apos;t know how to make a gr@@ en@@ ade , and they don
Well , what we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;ve done the mainstream society , the way we create things we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same thing as language .
But in terms of technology and technology and technology .
And so the only time I &apos;ve been curious about this kind of level of intelligence , whether you &apos;re much more interested in the quality of the quality of the group .
That &apos;s not my fault .
And the community has a sense of how good people have done their ideas , and how good they are , not how smart they are .
We &apos;ve created a collective brain .
We &apos;re just in the wild .
We are neurons this brain .
There &apos;s a lot of people who have a heart attack , and it &apos;s a little bit old , and it &apos;s got a little bit of a multi@@ tu@@ de of it .
It &apos;s not less , there are no good things .
Now , the future , we &apos;re going to go ahead and push it back together , and we &apos;re going to move it together .
The future of war , depression , priv@@ at@@ e-@@ suc@@ tion .
There &apos;s good things about it , I &apos;m sure .
But I &apos;m also convinced that there are people who future people , the ability to judge themselves , and to share a little bit less like that , I &apos;m also sure I &apos;m sure technology is going to evolve .
Because , you know , it can be done by crowd@@ source , but it can be gross .
Thank you .
