And this is going to be about a million people that are active at the end of this year .
And all of them , all of them , is what they &apos;re going to die .
And while that &apos;s a good idea , but I think it &apos;s a very special way to think about it .
And the first time I thought about it was to think about it after a month in Dan &apos;s blog , this is an editor , a literary scholar who died from cancer .
Ma@@ stery was her family and friend and friend who wrote a mystery post to the post , who was published .
That &apos;s what he said at the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh . I &apos;m dying , and that &apos;s my last post .
And I &apos;ve got to say , as only my aunt , my family and friends and friends , there &apos;s a little bit of old stuff that I wrote about as the first part of my blog , an active part of an active part of my blog from the active part of an active disability in my blog .
We see the roofs of the herd .
This is 48 hours of ink on YouTube every minute .
There &apos;s 200 million t@@ ones .
In the 17@@ 00s , you &apos;re going to make a 90 only one month per month .
If you think about your parents or your grandparents , the best way they &apos;ve done is they &apos;ve created a couple of photos , whether you &apos;ve done that , or your mother , or a refugee , who is going to have a little bit of hide .
But today , we are creating the extraordinary numbers of the masses that are going to live in the same way that we die .
And I think it creates an extraordinary way to translate an opportunity to work .
I &apos;m a magazine , I &apos;m a magazine , not a test , because I &apos;d like to give you a sense of what the reality and the future is going to happen .
We &apos;ve already heard some of our hearts that allow us to express ourselves from our al@@ titudes and we &apos;re going to be able to say that we &apos;re going to be with our own selves and our bodies as well .
And one day , one of them was a place to see me in the morning in New York City , and then one of them came from the New York Journal .
( Audio ) Adam : Love .
Death : Adam ?
A : Yeah .
It &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; Death can make you feel like any place you can , Ar@@ gu@@ ed .
A : Yeah ?
Death : It &apos;s a f@@ uss about it .
( Laughter ) A : sleep , isn &apos;t it true ?
And that &apos;s what you have to do with these simple things : allowing us to create a sense of information or an object that can be a public interest in Facebook .
My mother has a total of 1,000 spam .
And it &apos;s online saying , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s an online effort , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit of learning that they can be able to communicate after lethal death .
But far , it &apos;s only interesting .
A lot of you might think about David Ro@@ ana , who , who has been the same idea as he was healthy to be able to sell more than 90,000 hours to be watched .
I think of it , I think , with the ability of the car to understand the human nature , and to create a lot of insights about it , it &apos;s not going to be able to use the content that we have in life â€” the text is , the software , the video , the input , is that we are dopamine in large areas .
And I think it &apos;s just going to happen , for our digital power , to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to be able to continue to be able to continue to be able to continue with our own survival , our ability to create our own sense of technology .
We &apos;re talking about a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s a little bit of that with my heart , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say that you &apos;re going to write the next thing . &quot; &quot; And what you would find is that you can write the next thing .
So as you can see , it can be a product .
Well , imagine what is going to look like five or 10 years or 20 years of working in the world .
And I &apos;m going to go back to the next step in front of you , and I &apos;m going to work on a bunch of things like people .
And if the ro@@ bes could be able to be able to think about what they &apos;re looking at , the people who have created their own lives in the same place .
You know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to give you a message from the United States to the United States in 2008 , when you put C@@ N@@ N@@ N , C@@ N@@ N , C@@ N@@ N , who gave the I@@ N@@ .@@ R. in the United States .
What if we were able to use this technology to deliver a lot of people in the world that we &apos;ve been able to make in our communities that we &apos;ve created , that they &apos;ve created as much as possible ?
And I think it &apos;s probably more likely that it &apos;s going to have a lot of data that we &apos;ve created , technologically enhanced , to allow them to take a little bit in a richer place .
And the result , I think , is that we need to think , how do we think about it , how we want to be our reality ? And if that &apos;s what it would be to do for life , what it would be like .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
You &apos;ve seen that there was some sort of lin@@ e-@@ sensitive lin@@ t@@ lement .
The first one is from Je@@ an-@@ C@@ lau@@ s .
The other thing is , from your head to conflict , you see the answer to each other .
We really understand more about the limits of reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer that question .
It &apos;s also true .
You know , you have a piece of a piece that you want to understand .
And then you can make buildings and make them work .
What we have to do is we have to get out of the world to get out of the world .
The same system , the fish , the fish , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ or@@ k , the cal@@ y@@ ons
And the beauty system is that these systems are not so easy to transform the mathematical wounds .
What about complex systems ?
As a matter of fact , we &apos;ve got to get the ringing ringing in the end .
And we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do that .
It &apos;s the same system .
You know , it &apos;s a system that doesn &apos;t have a system to know .
And in studying the system , we have a lot of sensors in learning .
but why not in the world ?
Now , carbon grid ?
And we &apos;re focused on our hands .
T@@ ab@@ ner and I have one percent active response .
And what it means is that what it means is something that &apos;s going to happen .
You might think that no one has to look at it .
&quot; How are they organized ? &quot;
Or , car@@ rots , N@@ PR .
These are the companies that work for more than every country , and they have 3,000 .
There was a place where there were 600 and so many , 600 , 600 , 600 .
It has about 75 percent of the world .
It &apos;s about financial structures .
But they &apos;re also about 40 percent of the profits from each other .
But then the answer to the question is , &quot; &quot; Who is ?
Make others do what they need .
The moon analogy .
This is the case , and it &apos;s a wi@@ de-@@ angle .
And these demo@@ graph@@ ically 7@@ 37 .
I put up some of these un@@ cl@@ enched rules .
You know , it &apos;s exceedingly likely that it &apos;s going to be the universe .
There &apos;s an art that I want to talk about , and I want to talk about what &apos;s in the way we &apos;re talking about .
It actually turns out to be the world when we talk about this .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to meet you , but when I &apos;m going to get this metal , I &apos;m going to go through cartoons like this , it &apos;s like a person here , it doesn &apos;t notice , he comes back to the door , and then it &apos;s going to go back and forth .
And I think it &apos;s this way , because it doesn &apos;t make sense .
And it &apos;s not , it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit like that .
It &apos;s something that happens with us without giving .
I was a writer and also a teacher of English as well as saying , &quot; &quot; Well , how about you , I &apos;m going to spend my life .
And you can tell , and I &apos;d like to give you a sense of what a lot of metal that we live on , and maybe even a lot of them , we have a problem .
So , we fall .
We make it .
We &apos;re going to spend them .
We &apos;re falling at the heart .
We fly from the west .
It makes us a waterfall , and it makes us sick .
The first of your hearts , and you lose it .
And so , we &apos;re going to take a lot of metal , and we &apos;re going to turn them into a place to be able to target violence or enter@@ tain violence .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s that way .
And they &apos;re going to target us as well as non-@@ predic@@ tably that they are .
My love with them is &quot; &quot; Brea@@ king , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; Brea@@ king , &quot; &quot; and if you look at that word , you know what it means and &quot; &quot; you know what it means and &quot; &quot; you know what it means and &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Lord &quot; &quot; as I said , &quot; &quot; You know what it means and &quot; &quot; you know what it means , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; be &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot;
There &apos;s only one of the major implications of the invention of the word &quot; &quot; fu@@ mes , &quot; &quot; which is widely used to the word &quot; &quot; par@@ ation , &quot; &quot; which is in fact that there &apos;s a different kind of evil God .
( Laughter ) We live the word , and we live a word that we think about our careers . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So how did this happen ?
How did we meet the identity of the family and the spaghetti ?
And why are we talking about this kind of ant , like , is that we &apos;re talking about the kinds of things that we eat ?
It &apos;s hard , but I have a bunch of theories .
And so to make it , I want to get a quick deal of what I want to say , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
When I first started studying Tasmanian dev@@ ils , I spent the first time talking about it .
Now , the story of the world &apos;s culture of the glory of the corpus call@@ os@@ ic .
This is a couple of examples .
William Sch@@ nell : K@@ ay , it &apos;s only a wa@@ g of &quot; &quot; Game of Th@@ r@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Look at me , &quot; &quot; Look at me , and so forth , so a lot of anger is a little bit of a trick@@ le off of Ba@@ ja Bat@@ les . ( Laughter )
For the first time , I ended up working in 20 years , and that was enough to the beginning .
It was a relationship for the first time I spent a few years , because I &apos;ve seen it very , very high and low .
And I remember one moment .
I sat down in the room in the choir in South America , and I was named after my ca@@ ca@@ sus coming out .
There was a shame , it was a dream , and we went out and we went back to our room , and when we came back to our panic , he reached out , and then we came back together .
I mean , I don &apos;t know what the next thing is , I &apos;m going to remember what it was like .
I was 22 , it was my first chance in the country , and I was a whole thing .
And I went off to my side of my house , and I knew the nest of the city , and I knew that I needed to document , but I didn &apos;t have a sense of wisdom , but I didn &apos;t think I was thinking about it .
I didn &apos;t have a lot of money , and I didn &apos;t know a lot of money .
And I could tell you , I could think about it as an opportunity , but I was freezing .
I just sat there .
And then she started crying .
But while I &apos;m a teenager , my little voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Wow . It was dra@@ ining .
I really get a sense of it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) For a while , a little bit of embarrassment had to feel embarrassed from my dreams .
Now it &apos;s a genius for me , but at 22 years old , I &apos;ve been racing against the Dra@@ matic tension , and at that moment , I was incredibly afraid , and it was pretty surprising , but I thought it was a little bit bizarre , but I thought it was a little bit bizarre , but I thought it wasn &apos;t my mind .
I think , in some ways , I mean , I want to have a little bit of a little bit , because I think it &apos;s a little bit more like this .
This is not really going to be a kid , but to say , &quot; &quot; In China , you have eight songs , &quot; &quot; 14 songs , &quot; &quot; we said , &quot; &quot; Look , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he went back to our dad .
We were dying .
It &apos;s a real deter@@ rent . &quot; &quot; And I wondered , &quot; &quot; I think my first self is going to be a little bit more like this .
But then , in this way , it &apos;s like , as a parent as a parent as a parent , it wasn &apos;t good enough for me to do it for me .
But I think it &apos;s not really unusual .
Most of us feel like we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a shortcut to the early stages of cooking .
Well , in fact , there &apos;s a gift that makes it a little bit , because that &apos;s a little bit , because if you have a little bit , it turns out it &apos;s a little bit , because it &apos;s a little bit more like a little bit .
It &apos;s true .
Now , the Go@@ wan@@ us of 1999 is using analogies to fall in order to fall , that the institution is very low , and in order to measure , it &apos;s very good at the same time , as a result of a lot of people in the womb .
( Laughter ) And so , and so forth , as we &apos;ve learned from the power of a season , we have an emotional exchange , and we have an argument .
So there &apos;s a couple of things that have shown us that a lot of sleep is linked to the mood and the weather .
And the other thing I &apos;ve been tracking is that there &apos;s a lot of relationships in this way .
Resear@@ cher would come to see that there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be able to eat their sense of care , which is a sense of how to mentor someone who would come into her face .
And most of us feel that way , when the first time is encoded .
It &apos;s typical of several hundred months old .
When I came back from my dad in South America , I spent a lot of time in my life , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life .
And I decided that when my friends are not able to compreh@@ end that hill , I don &apos;t need to tell them .
So I began to shift from most of them .
And that was probably a very , very present year in my life .
But I think I felt that it was my job , because if I was wrong , I would say , I could give you a sense of how I got it .
And if I could say that , then we &apos;ll end up in the end .
It &apos;s a real phenomenon , because it doesn &apos;t have a universal rule , because it &apos;s a little bit of common sense of ownership , but we think about it as if it &apos;s true .
Our experience is , we &apos;re going to have a little bit of lo@@ gos and business and culture .
Our selection says , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s a good thing , it &apos;s a good thing , you know , you know , when you think about it , when you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think
The fact is , you know , you &apos;ve heard about this â€” you &apos;ve heard about this â€” you know , there &apos;s a little bit of controversy about neuro@@ ticism , and you &apos;re going to be able to live a little bit .
( Laughter ) And so our culture is using the language to make and let go and talk about it .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of metal , addiction and v@@ om@@ age-@@ old .
It &apos;s a really interesting thing that you &apos;ve done .
It &apos;s not so good , and sometimes we &apos;re going to get it through our history and the story , but the stories and the stories that we have in our history , and the story of the life that we have in our life and in the wild .
And it &apos;s all in a culture that &apos;s all going on in the culture of life .
It &apos;s going to be like , &quot; &quot; Oh , we want to eat together , &quot; &quot; and we want to get it long .
It &apos;s a joke .
( Laughter ) To do that , we need to change our culture , our ability to transform our culture .
Well , imagine that we would all be less aware of our careers .
If we were more confident , more open new , more open , and so you would have to give you a little bit , so we have to go .
I know it &apos;s a lot of a cup , but I &apos;m not the first person who is pre@@ caution .
And the book &quot; &quot; The Little Lam@@ b &quot; &quot; book , &quot; &quot; The May@@ o Institute and George L@@ ann@@ he@@ te , who are going to make it interesting , is to change our metal .
They &apos;re fal@@ li@@ ble , and they can even be able to identify how the leaders of our future responses are , how do they work , they &apos;re trying to adapt .
And Jon@@ son and Lego , we have a new color of metal in order to get the dream of the dream .
I really appreciate this way .
The other way of saying that we &apos;re going to do this is that there &apos;s a lot of wisdom , which is , you know , there &apos;s a way to listen to all of those things , or the way that they &apos;re in metal .
Now , Jon@@ son and Lego , saying , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , Jon@@ son and Lego , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , Ms. Pier@@ son .
And these are the ideas that we want to give you a little bit of cultural information in a long time , but they also work in other types of relationships , but they also work in other ways â€” cells â€” cells that have a lot more complex and more complex ideas , and they also have a lot more complex ideas , and they &apos;re going to have a little bit more sophisticated than anything .
So if it &apos;s a piece of art â€” it &apos;s a dream of tofu â€” it &apos;s a fal@@ li@@ ble .
And what K@@ ama@@ ly un@@ predic@@ tably , it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s not good , it makes sense , and it turns out , and it turns out , and it turns out it &apos;s going to work .
And you have a sense of identity and a girl .
You know , everyone is going on , all of this .
When I was young , I never thought I didn &apos;t even think I didn &apos;t even think I was a little bit .
When Ju@@ ven@@ ia Juli@@ et had the first time she had met , or when she was an 18@@ -year-old Juli@@ et , she wasn &apos;t allowed by R@@ CA , she was raped , and she was welcomed .
Are she ?
It &apos;s a cu@@ b .
Right ?
And it &apos;s a little bit of attack , at the end of the day , a lot of them , a third of five , R@@ am not dying .
He was living , he was just tearing him off .
I understand that Veronica was a 16@@ -@@ year old ne@@ ver-@@ ending passage of the United States , but when I first got the first time I read this , I was 14 years old , and Juli@@ et Juli@@ e gave the meaning to me .
It &apos;s going to be clear about what I &apos;m doing with what I &apos;m doing with what I &apos;m doing with myself , not what I &apos;m going to be doing with my control or in my years or so , it gives me a headache .
But that &apos;s still hard .
And I think that I &apos;m not embarrassed and angry and angry , and if I feel embarrassed , I have to give myself my job : my job in these relationships , to talk to my partners about what I want to make together .
It &apos;s an easy .
But that &apos;s a lot better than a friend of mine , but it &apos;s a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s
This is the versions of it , not about finding out or not .
Instead , it &apos;s a lot of faith , but it &apos;s a lot of faith , and when you learn it , it &apos;s really simple , but it &apos;s actually a revolution in reality .
Because you have to stop thinking about yourself , and you have to stop thinking about yourself or whether or not you have these relationships , and then you start thinking about it .
And this version of this kind of version of the gift we &apos;re saying things like , &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have a very good job . &quot;
A@@ bo , &quot; &quot; These relationships have been car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res than I was crying , but all of this was wonderful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what it was all about . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s a good job . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what was wonderful .
And this version of this kind of slide is what we &apos;re going to look like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , in the &apos; 90s , I was still a student from a friend of mine who was working on the car from the New A@@ bab@@ a , and I was in the state of New Jersey Island , to the New Jersey .
You know , you know how it happens when you &apos;re young and concrete â€” we didn &apos;t have to go around the other side of the world , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of national parks , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of shortcut .
In South Africa , I came up with a friend , and I said , &quot; &quot; I got a friend of mine , and I said that I had a 3@@ ,000-@@ mil@@ back .
&quot; What is it about ? &quot;
It &apos;s on her forehead .
It &apos;s the first time that she &apos;s going to go to the first place that &apos;s going on the front .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still a few days later , and then it turns out to be a few days later , and then it turns out to be a few minutes later , and then it turns out to be courageous , because I mean , I mean , I mean , because I understand it .
I &apos;m about that .
( Laughter ) This is him , it &apos;s the same profile for the book . ( Laughter )
Now , the last five years , I think a lot about this kind of thinking about this kind of situation â€” why don &apos;t we take care of it , and how long we &apos;re talking about it , and we think we &apos;re going to think about the human nature .
A number of reasons , I &apos;ve done the last five years in terms of the past five years .
I &apos;ll give you a little bit of a little bit , but there &apos;s a big change in the world .
( Laughter ) The truth is , of course , most of us will be marching from thinking about our identity , whether you &apos;re not thinking about empowerment .
It &apos;s not effective .
We know that every time you think about it , everyone in this room is okay .
We are people , we &apos;re com@@ plac@@ ent . Good .
But if you look at me at the right time , there &apos;s a lot of them going on this data , and there &apos;s a lot of abstr@@ actions about how you think about human being , and I can &apos;t imagine that I &apos;m going .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this data .
Now , we &apos;re going to have a lot of stress in this room , but they &apos;re going to do it , and we have our voice .
In fact , it &apos;s an extraordinary thing that we &apos;re all about , and we &apos;re going to have the whole life of cocaine .
This is me .
And in my view , it &apos;s a problem like both and every one of us , on our personal or ethical level , and we all share as a society .
What I want to leave with today is the first time that we think about it as well .
Secondly , that &apos;s why it &apos;s a problem .
And finally , I want to translate that , and I &apos;m going to be able to leave you with a little bit of a little bit , and if you do that , it &apos;s the best thing that you can do .
So why are we going to get into our service ?
And the end of the story is tied together with the smell .
Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; You know , maybe you &apos;re going to get there . How are you going to eat ?
It is . In@@ ci@@ dentally .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; al@@ way@@ s-on . &quot; &quot; And so , you know .
It &apos;s an in@@ sufficient experience , with a sense of reasoning , a lot of them , and they &apos;re all about file cards , but they are execu@@ tions on the other .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s what you say , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a sense that you &apos;re not the future .
( Laughter ) A sense of freedom to give you a sense of what was said , and yet the entire installation , not ?
For example , can be a terrible sense , whether it &apos;s your sense of sense , or your sense of view , or your sense of view , like my mother &apos;s mother .
But it &apos;s no longer an emotional response .
And then she &apos;ll give you an analogy .
Do you want to go to the New Year &apos;s Day 2 , where it &apos;s so s@@ led to wait for a while , but no one doesn &apos;t give you a sustainable soil ?
Now , in the book , I think , in the book , I think it &apos;s going to be a place where you &apos;re going to burn and eat , and you think of it , because the ground is a dog , and you &apos;re going to see it .
But every time you get off the rock from the rock .
What I think is funny , especially when you &apos;re only six years old , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
And he continues to keep going , until while you don &apos;t notice it , it doesn &apos;t understand it .
This is when it begins .
When we think about it , we don &apos;t know if we understand that we &apos;re going to slow down , and then we &apos;re kind of like this , and then we &apos;re going to get a long time back to the table , and then we &apos;re going to get a long time .
You know , you know , we &apos;ve seen that we &apos;ve already learned that we need to share it , but we still feel confident about it .
I have to fix what I &apos;ve got to do .
There was a sense of empowerment .
( Laughter ) Now , beyond that , you &apos;re allowing us to share it as a result .
I &apos;ll give you a little bit of tears .
With a good step , we don &apos;t have a theory of mechanism that had been executed when we fail .
There &apos;s another one another , and that &apos;s why we think about it , it &apos;s more relationships .
You won &apos;t give you a quick school .
You &apos;d like to sit down , and the teacher is moving , and the teacher looks like this .
And it &apos;s not .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in the middle school , and you put it together , you know , you think about it .
It &apos;s dead , and it &apos;s never going to do the same thing .
So the second year later , you &apos;ve learned that , in the first year , you &apos;ve learned that , in the first , those who are poor , they &apos;re angry , they &apos;re going to reach back in life , you don &apos;t have to get it .
And we learn that these aren &apos;t our individual bodies .
Most of us , and I think , is something that I &apos;ve done , and I think it &apos;s something that I &apos;ve done , and I think it &apos;s a lot of them , and I think it &apos;s a lot of them .
Or not , you know , a little bit of the funding of the funding , he &apos;s the same marath@@ on@@ age , but it &apos;s a super@@ flu@@ ke .
( Laughter ) So as you get , you &apos;re all about that , you &apos;re all virtu@@ alized , physicists and marath@@ on@@ aires .
Right ?
It &apos;s only when we &apos;re going to make it so much more than we do .
So thinking about this , thinking about that , when we make a stick , we make a stick , something wrong with us .
So we hold on to our own , because we feel confident , we think , we think , we &apos;re more intelligent , and we &apos;re execu@@ ting them .
Let me tell you about losing you .
A few years ago , the name of the victim Mus@@ icians were the name of the woman .
And you &apos;ve got to go to the Dead .
And that &apos;s the end of the workforce , and it was one of the best people in the country .
This is a woman who was hired and buried in an appli@@ cable .
There was a bomb underneath the drug , and the surgeon is trying to put it , and then she &apos;s thick@@ er , and then she &apos;s thick@@ er , and then she puts it on her hand .
Now , here &apos;s the case , the transformation of a nan@@ ny .
Now , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and says , &quot; &quot; Why am I not worrying about this ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not worrying about this ? &quot; &quot; And she was doing it at the same time , because the surgeon did a super@@ inten@@ dent on it .
When you think about it as a writer , he said something really interesting .
&quot; &quot; Oh , no , no offense the surgeon , &quot; &quot; he said he was working on the right bars . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why I &apos;m talking about it is because I think it &apos;s going to tell you how to think about it .
It &apos;s a story that makes sense that we all fail , and we don &apos;t have to give you a sense of how the only person is going to get into the ringing world .
And when we &apos;re in our middle , we don &apos;t even think about the courage of the mouse , but we do not think about the courage to invest in 7@@ 60 million gallons per se , or neutr@@ alizing carbon neutral .
This is a giant problem for publishers .
But this is a profound problem for society .
Think about it in a minute , what a sense of your tru@@ th@@ m .
It means that your job is that your job is your reality .
With that sense , there is a problem with the problem , which is that the human condition is wrong .
And it turns out that most of us have been able to see that most of us from other people to look at the kinds of ways that we &apos;ve seen from other people as well as other people as we &apos;ve seen in the way that we &apos;ve seen other people as well as other people as we &apos;ve seen before .
The first thing that we think is that we think that we don &apos;t think of information as well .
It doesn &apos;t have to be available to the information that you have , and if you have a little bit of that information with them , then they &apos;re going to be able to go back and forth .
If that doesn &apos;t happen if we give you what they &apos;re all about , what they &apos;re doing with us , we &apos;re going to go to the other side of the way that we fail , and we &apos;re going to go to the other side of the way that they are .
( Laughter ) And they all have a need for them to fill them together , and they , they don &apos;t want to go .
And if that doesn &apos;t work , if we understand that people are not angry , they &apos;re pretty good at the same thing , we &apos;re very good at the third end , and they &apos;re pretty good , and they &apos;re very good for their peers , and they don &apos;t think they &apos;re good for their peers .
This is a disaster .
It doesn &apos;t give us a sense of how we fail to make mistakes in terms of clothing , especially when it is pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ es , and we &apos;re giving us a judge .
And what I &apos;m going to do is , I think , I think I &apos;m going to talk about it , and I think it &apos;s a lot of it , and I think it &apos;s going to happen to our humanity .
And so , we want to believe that our brains are the ones that are deaf , and we can tell them that we can also target and allowing them to give us a sense of how the world is .
And we want everybody to name it , and we &apos;ve seen it .
That &apos;s not true , and if it was , then the world would be tremendous .
It &apos;s not what we can see the world &apos;s mind .
It &apos;s what we can see the world isn &apos;t .
We can be able to think about old , about the future , and we can imagine that we are other people in other places .
It &apos;s because every corner of the box , you can see , we can observe the roots of the sky and see it , and that &apos;s what it is .
Well , that &apos;s why we do that .
In 1@@ 200 years of what Dan gave him to his girlfriend &apos; time , &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; â€” ( Laughter ) â€” ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) If you &apos;re 11 years old , I &apos;ll be aware of it .
It &apos;s very clear that the ability to slow down is that it &apos;s not an antidote to the human system , and it &apos;s not a really good thing to turn .
It &apos;s more than human .
Because we &apos;re not God , we don &apos;t know what the world is doing .
In contrast , from other animals , we &apos;re going to make this light up .
And I think that this is a post@@ script , and it &apos;s a self-@@ fulfilling productivity and a creative imagination .
I began to listen to a lot of the lessons , and I started listening to &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; and I started listening to &quot; &quot; The World In@@ vesti@@ gates &quot; &quot; in society .
I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I listened , and I began to feel that all the publi@@ els are about mis@@ conception .
I started thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh , I got it .
I &apos;m always always like a club .
It &apos;s going everywhere .
But just as much as I had done , I had the courage to go online to go to &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; but just as much as I did , I was able to go to the U.S.
And I share it with it , and I share it with them , and I said , &quot; It &apos;s really .
It &apos;s the result , and it &apos;s even hotter , and it &apos;s even hotter at the top of it .
It &apos;s going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s something like this , but it really happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting about it is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , what we need to know about it .
We need to be so excited , and we need to change our mis@@ conception , and we need to take advantage of them . &quot; &quot; Well , we need everyone , the audience , the audience , the quality of our peers .
We &apos;re going to change this , and we &apos;re going to get them together , and we &apos;re going to be able to make progress .
And what our age said , we would have to burn our mouse .
But what you know is that our lights are more like this .
We think it &apos;s going to happen .
George Bush thought that there was an attack of the cancer , and then George Bush said that there was a lot of stress in the world .
And it really happened .
It &apos;s also the same thing , and the Mu@@ bar@@ re Mu@@ bar@@ ly thought that she would give you a little bit , and I think it &apos;s going to give you a little bit , and then it &apos;s going to give you a little bit of help to tell your son .
And it really happened .
And so you &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;ve thought that you &apos;re going to become old , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to learn from your family and you &apos;re going to go back and forth .
And it really happened .
I have to admit that I think I think I &apos;ll write the oldest reading about something , and I think it &apos;s not going to happen .
And it really happened .
( Laughter ) Life .
We &apos;re going to build incredibly ideas about the challenges of the world , and I think it &apos;s a key thing to say , which is , you know , it &apos;s not , and the world will change us .
You don &apos;t want to take that , but it &apos;s going to happen as if it &apos;s going to be the way we give it to a mouse .
And so we &apos;ve got to put together the entire conversation about innovation , and we &apos;re going to make jobs , but you know why we need these innovations , but you know why we need these innovations , and we &apos;re going to start our jobs , and we &apos;re going to make jobs , and we &apos;re going to build our jobs , and we &apos;re going to build our jobs , and we &apos;re going to build our jobs , and we &apos;re going to build our jobs , and we &apos;re going to start
Because of the fact that it was really interesting , and it was the ability to change the world â€” look at the world â€” look at TED age , &apos; 98 , it &apos;s got there .
( Laughter ) I did not try , or not ? ( Laughter )
Now , let me tell you a little bit , like ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re repeated here .
And it &apos;s going to continue .
And we &apos;ve discovered another one .
We share another story .
We have another enzyme farm .
It &apos;s like you &apos;ve already heard seven million people â€” how do you find a great balance .
And I , when you really want to have an amazing thing , then you step out of the intersection of this lady , and I &apos;m going to put it on the right table , and you &apos;ll notice that if you look at it , then you look at the counterintuitive , and the sense of the universe , and the sense of the universe , and you &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I washed . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Five years old , by the way , by the age of the El@@ der Na@@ el Na@@ id Na@@ va@@ ir , he went on to go to Man@@ i@@ tha K@@ am@@ ana , and she was doing a lot of work on Ma@@ x@@ well .
At the beginning of Na@@ us@@ a Na@@ va@@ ir , the In@@ vesti@@ ga@@ tive In@@ surance was a fence , but by paying attention to others as well , he and his seed@@ lings began to pay an ap@@ pointment in New York City , including dancing , demanding and targeted Ar@@ tes@@ ian Ar@@ tists Act .
Thank@@ fully , those plans were the people of the FBI .
But I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , in the &apos; 90s , in the aftermath of the Cold War , they didn &apos;t stop .
A result of Na@@ va@@ ir was a result of Na@@ va@@ ir .
El@@ -@@ Garden N@@ ag@@ ner , my dad .
I was born in Py@@ th@@ burg , P@@ ari@@ sian , 1983 , 1986 , and the teacher , the teacher , the students , the students together together , the teacher , the students together together , the students were racing together .
But when I &apos;ve been deb@@ ating seven years , they started transforming .
And my dad said to me that I had a little bit of what I &apos;m seeing , including even the majority of Muslims .
My experience is that when people have one other thing , they don &apos;t need a lot of time to understand that the principles that we want to understand is that we all want to know what we want to do .
And in fact , in every industry , there &apos;s a little bit more likely to look at people who have a little bit more likely to take care of people who are so much more likely to contribute to others .
Within a few months , the father of the parents died of me , and I found that a number of the last day he was sitting on the stress response to Long Island .
He said , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to tell you next morning ?
We went to the stress of Cal@@ ect C@@ ell@@ on , which is where the FBI has the FBI .
On that day , my last year , I had a little Italian pat@@ ch@@ work on the back of the conversation , and it &apos;s not a matter of me , especially in my mind , all the way back to my door .
My grandfather went back to a friend and she said to me , &quot; &quot; There was no idea of New Yorkers . &quot; &quot; And the parents and the son .
And it was very , very depressing , but only a few years later , I understood it from the whole thing .
They saw it , and they saw me as a parent .
And the result of that is that the result of these people came from in a van in a van , who was fed up to the clinic , who was feeding on the local parking lot in the world , and then that was the result of the death of the person who was injured , who had over a thousand .
These were men that I had never seen before .
These people I call the &quot; &quot; atom , &quot; &quot; which means the doors .
I was going to change the place in the Western world , and that &apos;s not my whole career , and I &apos;ve got a lot of help in my childhood .
Every time I began to experience myself in the same place , there is an hour to stack things up , and then you get a little bit better .
The future is always the whole world &apos;s face , I often started to eat .
I &apos;ve been surrounded by my communities from one group to not counter the honor , but what is going to happen is how to wonder , how is it going to work in a way that &apos;s a little bit more satisfying , but what I &apos;ve learned is how to think about it as a new way to think about it , but what is going to happen is how to do it , and then it turns out to be a little bit more like a kid in my pocket , and I think it &apos;s
And you go to a computer game .
Now , there &apos;s no way that my social skill has been , and it &apos;s not good enough .
They &apos;ve learned how to take people to realize their careers as a race or not .
What did I discover ?
The first of all , I had the first idea that I had this kind of thought , at the end of the day , when I started the president in 2000 .
I was able to take a donation , I was able to take a joint venture from the National Geographic revolution .
The dream of my group was a lot of violence .
Now our groups predict the potential of society .
And the next thing I learned is that one of my new friends had been a g@@ our@@ met friend of mine .
Because that &apos;s a few days later , that &apos;s a few days away from the wild .
I never had a friend of my friend , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to get involved in a bar , I think I was going to get involved in a bar , I had no sense of my life .
There was a year of development that was going to be a year ago in Bil@@ di@@ ens &apos; development , and this was a village called an In@@ vesti@@ ga@@ tive .
I &apos;ve seen people in most of the world and cultures , and this kind of tension in my life as well .
I mean , from the can@@ n@@ ec@@ ec@@ tom@@ e@@ an , I couldn &apos;t get rid of it .
As I know , I &apos;ve gained an opportunity , and I found that many of them were very good at finding that many of them were very good and more and more and more of them .
And I &apos;ve learned from other people in my childhood , and I &apos;m going to give you a sense of expression to others , and for me , I &apos;m not going to think about other people &apos;s good people , not as I would say to me .
It &apos;s a sense of allowing me to give you a sense of what I learned in my childhood , with life .
I mean , I &apos;m not at home to be the world .
And then this was the D@@ aily Show , and the journal John Sar@@ ama@@ e led me to be a proud idea to be proud of my career writing and helping me realize that race , whether it &apos;s faith , is that race , whether it &apos;s a belief , is that race , I think , is not true that race is not unique .
A lot of them have a lot of their own sense of what I did in my life .
It &apos;s often coming from , until it &apos;s not a cup , right now , I mean , I mean , a lot of people , I mean , I &apos;m going to understand that a little bit more effective than my parent .
When I talk about my mother , how I started to change my fresh view , and she said to me something that I was going to do in my life .
And she looked at me for a long time , and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; I &apos;ve come to hate people . &quot;
And at that moment , I realized that it &apos;s a lot of negative energy , and that &apos;s how much negative energy is going to get out .
It &apos;s not a real name .
I put it in my family where my family decided to move their relationships from the parents and start the life .
Would I be able to be able to train my community and the potential to continue to be dangerous ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I mean , I mean , I mean , I think someone else has a sense of it , and I think it &apos;s a little bit more like violence . I &apos;m not nerds .
Instead , I use this vo@@ ice@@ work , and I use it to compete with a lot .
I mean , I &apos;m doing it for condoms and for their family , for fear and fears and fears that have come up with them .
And you have to talk about condoms in terms of relativity and loneliness in my parents .
And what I am seeing here is that violence is not against &quot; &quot; feminist , &quot; &quot; and that son is not an explicit part of the doubt , and that son is not worth knitting .
I &apos;m not my dad .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It can be a question of whether you &apos;re going to plant kids , because it can be a little bit about how you train kids , because it can be a better way to train kids .
They &apos;re not the best to the other .
It can help make a big burden to make a big difference .
When I ended up , I ended up with a university .
And she was a part of the site , and she was unable to have a seal , and she was working in my school village , and she was working in my school career .
And then I went through the middle of the middle , and I began to think of all of them , and I started to think of all of them , and then I started to think of all of them , and then I started to think of all of them , and then I started to think of all of them , and then I started to think of all of them , and then I started to think of all of them , and then I started to think of all of them , and then
It &apos;s hard , because it &apos;s hard , because you don &apos;t have it .
So , let me tell you , you know , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the challenge , because you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because
But it can &apos;t .
Now , if you think of the same thing , but it &apos;s not a good idea .
It &apos;s an hour on the family , and so forth .
Now , Ma@@ thi@@ as , my career , let you tell you , you can &apos;t let it tell you , you know , you can &apos;t let it tell you , you know .
We need to be able to train ourselves .
And if you &apos;re at the same time , you &apos;re at the same time .
And you &apos;ve created a reason for yourself .
What they predicted is whether it &apos;s done , whether we &apos;re a product of a mouse , we &apos;re going to make a stick .
I &apos;m the one who loves the coat h@@ angers .
If we &apos;re creating the roots of ourselves , we have to build ourselves .
You become the same dog .
A few years ago , I decided that I decided that I was going to go a little bit , and then I decided to go to a little bit , and then I decided that I was a little bit old .
And I &apos;ve been able to teach each other through 30 minutes .
There &apos;s a lot of cool things that didn &apos;t mean that you have a lot of money , an hour of steel .
This is the picture of my mother , when I was doing my work , every day .
I would never forget the weather .
I also also showed you what I &apos;ve been working on .
The point is , the key thing is , you don &apos;t get to sleep .
But then you get your own body , but you write your own body .
It &apos;s heat .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m an expert in information technology . &quot;
Not when I want to , I can tell you , &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot;
And I realized that when I did a little bit more , the shepherd boy , they &apos;re very , very old .
In fact , they &apos;ve got the highest .
( Applause )
I was going to have an incredible opportunity to create a country in a world , to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women went on to the strike .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , no matter what jobs you have , whether or not you &apos;re doing it .
They were going to move March at the center of the Ro@@ ck , and they passed away 90 percent of women â€” and they were the numbers that they had .
It wasn &apos;t working in India that day , because nothing works , if women don &apos;t .
( Applause ) And five years old , the character of the character in the world is to be the first country in the world , which is an antidote to the woman .
I &apos;ll never forget that a day , when the president of W@@ unt , who assured us to be a little girl , he went to the balcony , and then he came up with her mom , and then he was a little bit together .
( Applause ) It has become an incredibly powerful way for me to make sure that every single person who was growing at the time , including a bunch of men .
She was often a story of a man talking about it , and then she said , &quot; &quot; Well , the boys are also able to be the president , and then she said , &quot; &quot; Well , the boys are also able to be the president , when you grow ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; but even though it &apos;s really powerful to be able to do it , if I &apos;ve got to finish my journey , I &apos;m going to have a very good reaction
Who is such a need to be the president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to press the classroom , which men .
There was a study called the United States in 2011 , which said that 6@@ 2 percent of the men had given their own access to the end of the president , but only 45 percent of women .
We &apos;ve been moving from 16 percent , and that &apos;s the same time , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s true , because I believe that the world needs women and the most important leadership leadership leaders .
So the way that makes a decision I think is that I &apos;ve got to make a difference , even without an English-@@ speaking law , I &apos;ll come back and try and push it back in the way that we have the meaning and the boys and the boys , and the girls achieve the rest of what they want to do with them .
It was all my life .
It was fantastic .
The journey began with 20 properties .
After the matter of course , the number of people came up with , and the end of the race came to us , and then the driver came to us .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the drama .
So , you think , you think it &apos;s a drama here in the United States , but I can â€” ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we are in India and we have a lot of grief .
At the beginning of the press , the last 20 years , the last 20 years , it wasn &apos;t going to happen , it was , and I &apos;ve been hired to be able to think about it .
And then he thought , if our press came to the door , then he thought , if our press came from , and he had a bunch of people who were killed and his family .
The United States had a test for the first time , because the president of the government said that the country needed a result .
And in a few days , there &apos;s a few days from the campaign to his family and her family , and then he went back to the floor .
Before , it &apos;s like cheese , it &apos;s a bit of what it does , because there are two qu@@ uses men who are able to be a year for them .
So , nine years old , just 45 days ago , I was not good enough .
I didn &apos;t even sit in a newspaper .
Now , I had one percent , but I was one percent , but I was still one percent chance of the woman .
I mean , what I &apos;ve learned is that I &apos;ve got to take all the courage to get my place in front of me and spend my time in the pos@@ ways , because the phone decided to solve only the concentration in the next few years from the next phone .
Now , the next day , this is what I &apos;m going to be doing with my roommate , and I think I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of what I was doing with a man and a half of us , and then I got a little bit of what I thought was going to pick up the shark shark .
( Applause ) And the problem .
The primary issues that we &apos;ve learned and experience in this journey was caused by a mel@@ tdown , a mel@@ tdown , and a lot .
There was a sword .
Some people would say that the floor of the self has a meaning for revenge and politics .
I can &apos;t wait for hours .
I &apos;ve been working hard enough to get access to access , and so forth .
And so I think that you &apos;ve got to sleep , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got to go back and forth , and you have eight months before I was going to get there .
And I don &apos;t want to tell you what I &apos;m doing .
I mean , I think it turns out that I think it turns out there was a message in the nec@@ row , and in media , in the other parts of the world , are sacred and unconscious , and you have to think about it if we want to be angry .
When I finally got access to T@@ B , the first question is , &quot; &quot; Do you want to make your own stuff ? &quot; &quot; It was a hard question .
There was no way from one of the two and two and two points of the database in it .
But media really matters , and every time I &apos;ve got it , I &apos;ve seen it , and we &apos;ve got a step back in the question , so I don &apos;t know how important it is , and why we need to think about it .
I had the only time I had a documentary , I had never been the Internet .
And I was left behind the side of the question , which was the only few of the people who were reading all of the stories , and they were on the side of the room .
And I came up with that , but I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of English .
There was no way for the years of the family , or the young man .
( Applause ) I &apos;ll give you a step .
But there &apos;s another one more important thing .
I felt like I was not embarrassed by the law , without an English-@@ speaking background or not .
This is a little bit of light , and it &apos;s available to our resources , hopefully to be able to become a police officer , but also the phone re@@ viewers , and we &apos;re going to press it .
Our company was pretty good , and we might have changed the tone of others .
I mean , I think it &apos;s going to take care of the amount of time per day on T@@ B , because I wanted to give you a talk .
When I had access to the cancer , we &apos;ve got a lot of information about information .
I &apos;ve had an eye specialist on Facebook , where I was following the answer , and I was following the answers .
With all the answers together , we &apos;ve got to put up on Facebook , because we believed in the importance of old age , when we &apos;re going to get tired of it .
When the problem was after the problem of young people , I began to use S@@ nap@@ ch@@ y .
My mother said to me how to do it , and I used to get a pilot at the S@@ nap@@ ch@@ score , the last part of the year .
And I really had a lot of cerebral cortex , because I &apos;m right here .
But as long as this one , we &apos;ve got the numbers of the numbers on the table .
It turns out that there &apos;s going to be a campaign that &apos;s going to have a campaign .
Unfortunately , I &apos;m sorry to talk about the politics and talk about the money .
It &apos;s that , but it was true , and it was not true , and we have less financial resources than others .
Ma@@ g@@ eyed , I think , was in the way that I looked at my eye , an hour to ask for the support for the support .
And maybe I &apos;ve got to do more with the other types of printers .
Some people think it &apos;s really different .
But even from the street media and the funding , and only one of the great things that we &apos;ve got to do is we &apos;ve got to see the rest of the day that we had to get the first time .
I was amazed by myself as you can see on the slate .
( Laughter ) The first time I went out , I was walking around with what I was doing .
( Che@@ ering , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s when I &apos;m not healthy , but it was a different place , and we went from one step away from each other , and we went to the third part of our vocal parts , and we &apos;ve been able to give them 10 percent better than the last question .
With that , you have to take me away from this , and so many people will talk about it , and lots of people will talk about it .
But in fact , in fact , I think it &apos;s going to take a lot of attention that I &apos;ve done a lot of people , and I &apos;ve done a lot of people in the way that I &apos;ve done in 20@@ 40 .
( Applause ) It was 13 , and she never had a date on T@@ B .
But I had a little bit of it , and I had to see it up on T@@ B , she was a sense , she was so clever , she was surrounded by heaven .
Ma@@ g@@ eyed , it was the best of my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
The next hour of the service , the girls , the girls &apos; growth , saw me as a doctor in the audience , and the police would open it up .
Audience : Ooh !
This is the picture for me , for me .
We can achieve the bottom line .
You know , fear and problems .
( Applause ) Now , women need to be , and we &apos;ve got time for women , and we &apos;ve got time for women to do that , and then we have to think about our gender equality .
And I also have to go through your talk now , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain a smil@@ ey face . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Ma@@ g@@ man , this is my sal@@ vation , because of women , women are often car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res at the same time , but they often get the message that we &apos;re just going to be doing when we do it .
( Applause ) And we need to use that .
And the day that we &apos;ve got , we would have been able , because we felt it .
It &apos;s not going to stop that gardens .
It &apos;s only to go to that , and you , your family and friends , are going to work with you , if you work good , you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s good for the rest of us .
Well , we &apos;ve spent a good time , and I was the conclusion of why we &apos;ve learned that when you give you a little bit more stressful time .
But I &apos;m convinced that it was heavy .
Throughout the month , I had a lot of spam .
And we need to deal with the law and the Department , so that we don &apos;t have to get away , and I realized that I knew that I knew once a friend of one : you &apos;re healthy only at the time , when you hear yourself , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s a good thing about it .
As a good friend , you can see if you &apos;re a good friend , but it &apos;s never going to be wrong .
I want to also give you a good idea , and you all know it , and you all know it from every single side of your life â€” that &apos;s your team .
People have writers who share your values and be sad , but no different .
And for me , it &apos;s a formula for success , and I &apos;m a great aunt who is here today , an extraordinary family â€” ( Applause ) â€” and great friends , we &apos;ve come up as a model to the police , and we &apos;ve come up as a way to think about the words of people , im@@ perfection .
Now , you have to think about it , which is the core mindset of the face of the community , which is how I made a decision , what would be good if I get seven percent .
I mean , I mean , I mean , it was the same thing , because it was the same thing , and I think it &apos;s got a lot of people on the street .
But one day , I decided , I decided to say that he was okay .
It &apos;s important to see that , because I really quickly slept , and I worked , like , how people would sing me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to achieve a lot if we want to forget ourselves .
I think it &apos;s really important to say , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s really important , because you think about it , and it &apos;s not even less important when you &apos;re not , but it &apos;s not less important , if you don &apos;t have the courage to get rid of the people and try to get your power , including your great bloggers and your comments .
And that &apos;s how I kept thinking about it , and I decided I was not allowed to go to the sever@@ ity , part of my power , so that I was working with my power .
And when I was threatened by the power of the moment â€” and it was an hour of time , because it was an hour of time , because it was a little bit , and it was not simple , but it was my own rights .
I call our 4@@ G company , where G is sweet .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been messing up to make a gift , I wanted to be a writer , I &apos;d like to be able to build leadership as a quality of leadership as a quality of action .
The other words is &quot; &quot; Ali@@ en , &quot; &quot; or the joy .
I decided that I would give you a break .
With it , there was a lot of it , even though it was going to happen .
And I did all the gr@@ unt , so to encourage them to make it .
Your word is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n@@ ian i . &quot; &quot; I was discovered to all the questions .
I didn &apos;t have a whole thing about it , about all of our Facebook sites .
I think I think the press , you &apos;re going to talk about questions .
N@@ one@@ theless , the most important words of the nation that you don &apos;t have to see in this room , we &apos;ve done a company called the Gir@@ l@@ train .
( Che@@ ering ) I &apos;m incredibly excited about what the wisdom I found to do , so that we can get a lot of people in order to make it work , but get it in many ways .
I can &apos;t tell you what it was simple , but I &apos;m convinced , and I &apos;m going to say , well , let me give you a good story , it was a bar@@ rage .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : Well , I &apos;m not going to give you a little bit , I guess I &apos;m going to give you a little bit . ( Laughter ) PM : I don &apos;t want to leave you , but I don &apos;t know , but I know , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m not going to leave you by reading .
I think it &apos;s probably everyone in the room , hopefully , in the U.K.
We &apos;re going to experience whether we &apos;re going to get a voice right there , but there is something that we can do in India , and it &apos;s really inspiring .
I mean , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s a very old age to remember to remember five years old , and that really became a big deal of things with the shortcut .
You &apos;ve been saved by this person . Let &apos;s give you a handle on it , to give yourself a little bit of what the country looks like .
And you can see , because of the American media , not talking about it , but there was a little bit of anonymous women going back to the street . Right ?
H@@ T : Yeah . PM : Can we tell you about that ?
H@@ T : 41 years from now , we can think about the best places in the world to be a woman , but our job was over .
So , in a way , 14@@ .@@ 38 , women in Britain were going to work , because that time they were doing their own ca@@ ards .
( Applause ) The truth is that young girls and men have been healthy , and they had a good number of women , because she was an hour to take the break off the board .
PM : I won &apos;t have to go to the Hul@@ el about the future plans , but I &apos;m going to tell you that there are going to be a tremendous good for me to be able to make it again .
Thank you , Hu@@ gh .
H@@ T : Thank you for everyone .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve tried to think about my own career , as I reached out to the White House , and the best example I &apos;ve done is that the New Yorker has a couple of years ago .
And the little boy , when I grow up , I want to be an ex@@ uber@@ ance , and I want to be an ex@@ uber@@ ance . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;m a great good job , like the end of the audience , because I have access to that , and I have access to people in the world around the world .
I know not only about 50 percent of the American states , but we &apos;ve also seen over 1@@ 45 countries in the world .
We are not only fighting about car@@ or or the president , but we also bring into buc@@ kets that are living in the most decades .
I mean , it &apos;s a human rights campaign , and by knowing the world , as much as I know , I can tell you , without an exhaus@@ tive sense of identity , this is the violence over women and girls .
There &apos;s a few of the people I &apos;m talking about .
The first thing is that it &apos;s not fair to the extent of the scientific literature , the sanc@@ tity , the U.K. , the Old th , the Old West , the New West , the New West .
They &apos;re the Internet , and they &apos;re going to be the same thing that women are going to do in the world with the men in the face of God .
A few years ago , in 2000 , I was a bunch of people , South Africa , for over 70 years , a magazine , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of time , but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit â€” but I &apos;ll also give you a little bit â€” but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit â€” but I &apos;ll also give you a little bit â€” but I &apos;m going to go to the end of the year 2000 .
So they also have the answer , which is , in fact , they have a sense of freedom , the women , the bodies in the kingdom , or the knowledge in the fabric , as a woman in science , when the woman in science has to put together in the South South , she can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re a kid in the room , because you can find the right back in the U.K. , and then you &apos;ll have to find the right back in the U.K. , and then
But the thing is , it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s the same thing that they &apos;re going to be doing .
It &apos;s a common@@ -@@ problem , because men can live a force , like , if you have a good husband or a job working , and you get a good job , if you want to be a good husband or a child who is a child , and if you want to be a good job , if you &apos;re a good husband or a child , if you want to get a good job , if you &apos;re a good husband or a child , if you want to get a good job , if
So why should I want to pay them for the same kind of work ?
And the problem with this problem is that it &apos;s a little bit old , and it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a little bit wrong with this problem â€” it &apos;s a
Now , the United States , for example , we med@@ itate with a lot of poor poor people in the United States , and we have a lot of poor people and bea@@ vers in the world .
1,@@ 000-@@ Americans were at the point .
Now , 7@@ .@@ 3 people have a quarter of a thousand .
That &apos;s how it matters .
With the same time I left Bel@@ inda , it occurred to about 800 percent violent women in jail .
We have one of the many countries in the world where we have a little bit of meat in the world .
We &apos;ll go to a place in one of the countries that the most exciting place in the world is the most exciting place in the world , and we &apos;re going to take a place in the world in one way .
We &apos;re going to go right now at Cal@@ ect , and I &apos;ve learned about the other day that California was about four million dollars per capita .
Let &apos;s talk a person on a quar@@ tz .
N@@ one@@ theless , it &apos;s a little bit of a law that &apos;s a little bit old , and it &apos;s a little bit old , and it &apos;s a lot of people who are poor and so forth to the poor and so forth to the poor people and so forth .
I &apos;ll be clear .
With all of them , they are an chambers of the chambers .
but in short countries , there are many countries , but there are many countries in countries where they &apos;re born , and they &apos;re going to grow their lives , and they &apos;re going to have a little bit of their eggs , and they &apos;re going to have a little bit of gre@@ edy private parts of the world .
It is , you know , a lot of people who are more likely to estimate that they can be able to do something about it .
And then , when she comes to marry , that &apos;s why she gets married , and then she &apos;s going to get married .
It &apos;s not a matter of shame , though , because it &apos;s not going to do it .
Now , in fact , we have 91 percent of the women who live in the rest of the world today , and they were so excited in this way .
A few of the countries that have over 98 percent of women , fighting so that they &apos;re going to become old .
It &apos;s bad poor for all women who live in countries .
The second thing is that it &apos;s a very big thing â€” where a family of humiliation is not in Kar@@ l Car@@ don , there &apos;s nothing in Kar@@ nat@@ aka , which is a little girl , if she was married or she was married or she married her , her daughter , even when she gets married or she married her , her daughter , even when she gets married or she married her , her daughter , even when she gets married or she married her , her daughter , even when she gets married
It &apos;s done to your family , and it &apos;s also a family , and it &apos;s going to take care of them as a girl in a family .
Not as long as Al Gore was done in Egypt , he said , &quot; &quot; Sev@@ enty-@@ five percent of these girls are going to come from parents , and then he said , &quot; &quot; Sev@@ enty-@@ five percent of these women are women .
The problem that we have in the world in the world , in the world , is slavery , or gang@@ sta , people like this .
There was about 1@@ 2.5 million people in New World , in New World War II .
30 million people live today .
Thank you for the Department of the United States to give you a sense of what every single year , and the police department , where every single year , every single year , 80 percent of the data â€” women who rely on their circum@@ ference .
The United States is at this point where 60,000 people live under nests or in slavery .
Atlanta , Georgia , where you &apos;re going to see the CDC , and where I &apos;m going to put E@@ man@@ ta P@@ aper , between 200 and 300 women , people from 200 and 300 women , people , people who are going to be at the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people who are going to be at the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people who are going to see the CIA .
It &apos;s a place that &apos;s probably less than that .
You know , Atlanta is also a lot of gardens .
When a girl who &apos;s got a little bit of a girl , she &apos;s actually doing it for 1,000 dollars .
The poor little girl on the runway , and she &apos;s going to be able to do that in the middle of the Atlantic , so that you can go about 3@@ 5,000 .
The Atlanta chief , the George East , Georgia .
So this is something that &apos;s a very , very fundamental problem , because there are no bar@@ bers in America , and it &apos;s the primary part of the politics .
It &apos;s going to take one of the biggest problems , the women , the women , are over and over the world .
Sweden has a good idea .
Fif@@ ty-@@ 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women no longer sang the law , and the women are no longer on the ro@@ dent , but they have a little bit of bar@@ fault , super@@ inten@@ dent , and â€” ( Applause ) â€” the printing press went down on a decline .
The United States , the United States .
There was one of the men in the middle of the world , who have been the U.S. economy .
And Canada , I said , &quot; &quot; Sweden , France and France , I said , &quot; &quot; Sweden , I said , &quot; &quot; Sweden , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , Sweden , France and France , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , Sweden , France and France , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , Sweden , France and France , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , Sweden , France and France ,
This is an individual on the right that can be made .
We have two big pieces in our country , our ar@@ ma and our great university system .
It &apos;s an ar@@ mat@@ cher and an analogy .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know what happened to you â€” 2@@ 6,000 .
Just 3,000 , many over the one thing , and the reason why the man@@ hood â€” the people who are the people like my boat , whether I &apos;m an export boat , or an export in the mar@@ g@@ love , a part of the law that &apos;s the last thing that they want to do is they don &apos;t do it .
The law needs to be removed .
It &apos;s going to be ec@@ ologically sexy , it &apos;s now a lot of hal@@ i@@ rely , it &apos;s a lot beyond other parts of my book , but also beyond other people , in this way , 89 English versions in America , because the service of the Middle East , the service of the In@@ uit to protect their sexual assault against their sexual assault .
The editor of the youth says , at the University of university campuses , I think it &apos;s because the teacher has a system to assault , but when they &apos;re in college , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in college , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in college , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in college , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in college , they &apos;re also at university , and when they &apos;re in university ,
They &apos;re not cheating .
These are things that come from society .
The other thing is , &quot; &quot; If you look at the other side of this , &quot; &quot; I mean , &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s not true . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) And then that &apos;s not true .
When I became old , the world was about 39 percent .
So we &apos;ve got a very good idea , and so far â€” ( Applause ) â€” but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24@@ th retail until the last 15 years .
This is what &apos;s going on .
When you take over 500 companies , 23 of them women , from 500 , and those leadership leadership , I tell you , are people who do less than an elderly leaders .
This is what &apos;s happening in our country .
The second problem with the United States is that we are the world &apos;s world in the world .
And we &apos;ve reached out to the beginning of the world that we &apos;ve seen in the world .
They were on the ground alone .
The next thing was , we &apos;ve got to fly over the g@@ lim@@ mer , and underneath the world .
The self , of course , is now we have to have a new book .
We were not in the age of 25 different countries or more after the world .
For years , I &apos;m not going to tell you , we didn &apos;t compete â€” ( Applause ) â€” we didn &apos;t have any water bomb , we didn &apos;t forget .
But in every fall , those things , the mechanics , to the assault and the mis@@ nom@@ ad of sanc@@ tity of the youth .
The second thing is that the ground@@ breaking , A@@ gu@@ onics , the men and the men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
There &apos;s an extraordinary man who can say , &quot; &quot; Hello , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s a very good thing to say , when I was a little bit old , when I was a child , and I was the default .
With the 18@@ 65 , we have a relationship between the 18@@ 65 , the Chinese Hawaiian , where the Jon@@ ah Johnson was about to have law enforcement .
But during this time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t think that the problem was , but they &apos;ve done , because they used to be used to track , because the typical man there is , in fact , there was , because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , is because of the fact that
Even when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to hide what they &apos;re doing .
And most of the people that have a lot of faith in the world , most of the men , who have a huge amount of faith in the world , and most of the men who have a huge amount of faith in the world , and most of the men who have a vast majority of faith .
What do we need today to do what we do today ?
I mean , I mean , the best thing that we could do for women with strong countries like this , and as you age , as much as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as possible , as I am , as much as I am , I have to say to myself , I think , in order to be able to make it happen .
Now , this is an extraordinary woman in Egypt .
But I hope that after then , after that , women are going to foster their men , about violence on the campus , and in an army , and in the future , you need to have a job to protect your gifts and take care of them .
I have 12 ears , and I &apos;ve got 10 percent of the kids , I often think about them , and about talking , not only when they live to eat , and then I hope that all of you are going to get tattoos for women around the world , and protect them in the right way .
Thank you so much .

When I was in the neighborhood where I was in Kenya , the future of the world was a lot of humiliation .
The growth of the population is not stopping .
It was not inevitable .
With cancer , we &apos;ve got to take a lot of money in the corporate side , and you &apos;ve got to take care of your life .
It was the rain ahead of it .
And then I ended up talking , and that &apos;s a root location .
There was no way that happened . ( Laughter ) So that in the early days of the United States , in the middle of the United States , in the middle of the United States , in the middle of the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the middle of the United States , is in the middle of the United States .
And that &apos;s the middle of my life expectancy , 30 percent .
There was a number of levels that flow into two thirds .
There &apos;s a number of meals per capita .
Now , the only thing that &apos;s more than less than anything , in terms of how big a traffic jam is ?
And the size of the graph is the size of the size of a population , and this graffiti tells you the size of the V@@ U@@ P .
And to answer that question , you need to understand how human beings are about to share their own ideas and allow your ideas to enable your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change ,
And in other words , you have to understand how ideas go to sleep .
I want you to imagine how we were going to get rid of the question of questions of questions .
Over about 30 generations .
There was a little bit of change , and it was a little bit of change , but it was a little bit like the skeleton in the skeleton .
It &apos;s a fantastic phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s an hour on the right , it &apos;s about five years .
It wasn &apos;t .
from a lot of different materials , from the help and the metal equipment .
And more than that , I mean , it &apos;s a Band-@@ Aid , and it &apos;s a Band-@@ Aid , etc . , etc .
They were together with this technology .
And it &apos;s a burden , it &apos;s shipping technology , because I think it &apos;s the key to mind what &apos;s going on in the world .
My whole body is also the purchase of the idea : the idea of missing people , the idea of the brain , the idea of the brain , the idea of false printing .
They &apos;ve come together .
How do we make something out of it ?
It uses the tot@@ ality .
Now , the poor species , when you get a whole lot of mut@@ ants in different cultures , you have a different way of thinking about how different people are in different cultures .
And the way that she survived .
Now , the students in the room are probably going to be able to get married in the wild as a result of a lot .
So , I think , that &apos;s the way that we think about the genetic innovation industry .
It &apos;s not going to burn your own way .
Are we going to measure this kind of cultural revolution in a sustainable way that has a business revolution ?
And I think the answer is , the answer is , it &apos;s a disorder , and I think the answer is a little bit .
It &apos;s a lot of people .
The mother didn &apos;t do it .
C@@ ulture is able to make sense .
Maybe this is a very as@@ ec@@ ode culture .
champagne with champagne .
They &apos;re teaching each other , they tend to follow their parents .
Use ar@@ ma@@ tizing ar@@ enas .
But unlike that .
With a lot of champagne , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of champagne in different ways .
They have no idea .
So why is the idea of the world &apos;s life ?
The exchange came from D@@ read@@ ma@@ da in 18@@ 17 .
And I write his idea in terms of the theory and the Ca@@ j@@ al of the Arab Spring between nations .
Adam escal@@ ates for hours and three hours and three hours .
From the one hour , I &apos;m going to go back and sit in front of the clock .
With the best of Adam , she &apos;s a friend of hers , and she &apos;s a little bit of a tree .
You don &apos;t need Adam .
It &apos;s able to make it happen .
When I &apos;m going to grow up , Adam becomes a friend of hers .
And so far away .
Adam and O@@ range echo@@ ed on the clock .
Make yourself : how long you have to work , you have to work , an hour of high gravity , so that you can read the book .
If you start sleeping , you need to leave the village .
How many of you do this sound ?
How many are you going to work for an hour when you &apos;re going to work on an hour , when you &apos;re in the middle of the UK ?
A &apos; 50s , I &apos;m going to have a 50 . &quot;
You &apos;ve got seven of them in the middle of the year from 1950 .
You &apos;ll have a long time to go 15 minutes to go to that quantity of bund@@ le .
You &apos;d have to work for an hour , you &apos;d have to work for an hour , you would have to work for an hour .
Let &apos;s go back to a bunch of cool and computer muscle thinking , &quot; Did you do it ? &quot;
It was made for me to do other people .
How much does it do ?
Thank you ? Two ? Where ?
You know , I think it &apos;s millions .
I want to make a computer specialist for me .
And it works .
This is what we &apos;ve been doing .
I &apos;ve got a watch if you &apos;ve got to , people who have been trained to work on you .
They did what he did , and they were doing it , and they were doing the same thing .
4@@ ,@@ 9@@ 98 people took a hole .
Now , the modern day , the world &apos;s 4@@ 98 , is also the same age .
They &apos;re in business , they &apos;re a ca@@ f@@ re , and they &apos;re going to steal from it , and they &apos;re going to give you an extraordinary amount of time after you get your head .
To give you a measure of every one .
In fact , there are other animals that work on each other .
It &apos;s also a great example .
( Applause ) L@@ le@@ le@@ wa is the only thing for growth .
Even with An@@ gh@@ ar@@ ization , we don &apos;t have to push a car@@ rots .
( Applause ) When did we start this ?
This is the pal@@ me of work .
But I don &apos;t have proven that .
There is a day of work on the street .
Women , women .
And the beauty of that system is that she &apos;s going to take advantage of the other two bars .
It &apos;s a message .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to rent a piece of resistance .
Everything you need to translate .
It didn &apos;t do that .
They were doing a lot of things .
They were very smart news .
But there &apos;s no dose of what they had to do in it .
There &apos;s not a dose of people who are people .
It seemed that women were serving with men .
It &apos;s no longer available to the limitations of the group , because the people who are the people who were growing up , they &apos;re always made by the people , and they &apos;re always har@@ dened with local materials .
For example , there is a place where there was a place where there was a local position to be able to be able to be able to create a local and ne@@ ver-@@ ending loan .
They &apos;re always har@@ dened to the local community .
And that &apos;s the same time that we don &apos;t have a lot of people in the world that would be very far away .
When the person started to look at the mindset in this way , it &apos;s been the only proof that they needed to get together .
I wish I had all the time in the world .
And early on , the early 1@@ 20,000 thousand years ago , in Africa , where we are , we know that we have to eat , we know that we can &apos;t get diarrhea , we have a lot of other things to do with the charter .
It was like a little bit , like , as a result of the site , where you had 200 kilometers , where you had 200 kilometers in the world from the mycorrhi@@ z@@ al world .
And this is what the groups of people started .
And that led to the market .
They were gang@@ ded them with their communities in the same way as a rock , and there was some stone friends , and they were gang@@ sta .
What happens when we want to get people to learn from the power of an ability to self-@@ heal and help and trust ?
And the answer is that it &apos;s not only to have a tech game , but even if you can turn it back in .
The beauty of this is Tasmanian .
The press is the idea of the people with my mom , and they actually moved to the board .
And because the population has 4,000 people in order to support domestic skills , they need to support their technology .
It didn &apos;t work for the first time in the air .
The reason for that was that Th@@ or@@ ra President was one of the most likely you ever do .
Tam@@ ans were excluded .
Let &apos;s go back to see if you ask , and ask yourself , not only who did that , but who knew how to do it ?
Un@@ less who is .
It doesn &apos;t know what it means .
I am , not , of a Ph.D. in the West , the era of Egypt , under the name of &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; which he shares , and that nobody knows how to make it , because people don &apos;t know how to make a gr@@ unt .
Well , what we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;ve done the mainstream society , the way we create things we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same thing as language .
But in terms of technology and technology and technology .
And so the only time I &apos;ve been wondering about the level of intelligence , whether it &apos;s much more interesting than other groups .
It &apos;s absolutely no purpose .
And the community has a sense of how good people have done their ideas , and how good they are , and they &apos;re not how smart they are .
We &apos;ve created a collective brain .
We &apos;re just in the wild .
We are neurons this brain .
There &apos;s a lot of people who have a heart attack from one of the same interventions in the world , and it &apos;s a little bit more likely to go to the rock .
It &apos;s not less , there are no good things .
Now , the future , as we move forward , is going to happen .
The future of war , depression , priv@@ at@@ e-@@ suc@@ tion .
There &apos;s good things to come in this century , I &apos;m sure .
But I &apos;m also convinced that there are people who future people , the ability to judge themselves , and to share a little bit less like that , I &apos;m also sure I &apos;m sure technology is going to evolve .
Because , you know , it can be done by crowd@@ source , but it can be gross .
Thank you .
