( Arabic ) I &apos;ve got a joke in Alabama .
I was born in the middle of my family .
It was five years old , and when I was born , I was born .
There was no difference , they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother was born 16 kids .
With 16 kids , only five children died .
You know , it was a picture of a dream .
Now , I &apos;ve seen a lot of women who were talking about their parents , whether they were kids who were going to know their names .
When I ended up in the middle school , I went to the middle school .
I wanted to be the doctr@@ ines to help women and children .
So I ended up having a school .
Sadly , my country has not been the Internet for a girl , so that I was a wi@@ de-@@ view , but I couldn &apos;t use it .
And my parents came to America .
I moved to America .
I ended my education .
And while I was working , I had a country in my country .
You know , when I was a teacher , I didn &apos;t even know what happened to my family and from my country .
There were months , but I didn &apos;t know anything .
My family was in the camp for be@@ ads .
As soon as I ended up , I gave my family my family in America .
I wanted them to live in safe .
Was it a mother &apos;s heart ?
My heart was in Africa .
I was seeing what &apos;s happening from my country , my mother &apos;s heart .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that
I did a good job .
I gave you the teacher to school .
And here I &apos;m going to go to the camp .
When I left this camp in Beijing , I &apos;ve seen 7@@ ,500 million of the be@@ ads .
And 90 percent of them were women , and girls were women , and they were women , and they were told , you know , when I was in the Olympics .
I knew things that I &apos;d like to do .
I &apos;ve seen five of the five children who sat and I cried , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I &apos;ve seen a young woman who was not allowed to go to the world , not a lot of education , not a lot of education .
I &apos;ve seen a bunch of guys who had lost their parents and their bodies , their bodies , and their bodies .
It was very a@@ dep@@ t .
At that moment , we &apos;re talking about momentum .
And at that moment , I asked myself , &quot; What do I do for these people ? &quot;
How do I help them help ?
And at that moment , I realized that education changed life .
She changed me , gave me the status .
And at that moment I realized that I had to give Mother education and health , and I began to work .
I mean , what I was like ?
Not because at that moment of education , there was a little girl .
And because Ra@@ season I ordered an Afghan country .
And it was to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do it . &quot; &quot; Right ?
Did I tell you ? It &apos;s not .
That &apos;s why I was going to be able to become the finish line .
How did I do this ?
I was obsessed and noisy and noisy , noisy .
I covered .
Y@@ ep , 80 years old .
It was the flour .
I went into it .
And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Look , a woman , &quot; &quot; How am I going to be teachers ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m angry with you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a teacher with you . &quot; &quot; And when I began with his actions , there was a little bit of news about it .
Now , we &apos;ve done 25 schools , and 15,000 schools , and 15,000 kids in school , they had a huge .
( Applause ) Thank you .
Now , we work , we &apos;re a lot of people , we &apos;re a lot of teachers , and we give you the right of women , right ?
And one day I was at the office in Pe@@ ñ@@ a , P@@ ac@@ ra@@ stan .
And I saw that I saw my father as my father , and I saw the door , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , you go . &quot; &quot; If that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing ?
You get married . It &apos;s dangerous .
You know , in your life .
But you have to be male .
You need to do it .
I said , what &apos;s going on ?
So I got them .
They went . Nine of them .
( Laughter ) You know , there are people who are passionate about people . ( Laughter )
I gave them a lot of them , and I &apos;d like to give you the harmony .
They said that the closet was not going to be .
N@@ one@@ theless , their voice , the voice they talked to me , I was very , very quickly .
But I was really om@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , but I was a man .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
What are you doing right now ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to look at them , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to go out there . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; This is a little girl .
And we have to take some students out , and we have some students , and we &apos;re going to give you some students , and we &apos;re going to give you some students , and we &apos;re going to give you some students , and we &apos;re going to give you some students , and we &apos;re going to give you some students , you know , we &apos;re going to give you some students , you know , we &apos;re going to give you some students , you know , we &apos;re going to give you some
And the Q@@ ur@@ an tells us that when you leave the Ka@@ il@@ re of the woman , ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And they began to talk to the pub .
And at that moment , I was going to put it back together , and they came up and they began to match .
The teacher started coming out .
And then 3,000 students are not embarrassed .
It was allowed to answer .
With mother and children .
There was rules about health care .
We have all the tri@@ tives that you can only imagine .
I was fortunate . I was happily thinking .
There was four thirds , one , one , and I went on to go to the Kab@@ ul , and I went on to stop the journey of 19 parents .
With flowers on the beaches , they were turning to us .
And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And my father went out and said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you what it is .
What you need ?
And that time , we have all these .
And yet , it &apos;s a point where we have to be healthy .
We@@ ats , you &apos;ve got it .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
Now , when you &apos;re going from the point where you &apos;re going from now , you &apos;re going to be doing it .
And I went and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll give you a phone drive . &quot; &quot; I went into a machine , sat in a car .
It &apos;s about to fix them in school , not what the other thing is .
There was no one left .
And I was just a specialist . I lost my voice .
I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said ,
There were hundreds of women in order to make education .
So , I sat down , and I &apos;m not talking about the game — at this point , we talk about the momentum — at this point , one of the great things that we have in the database of the book .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sa@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said .
She said , &quot; It &apos;s not you . What happened ? &quot;
But if you don &apos;t wait , it ain &apos;t broken .
You &apos;ll be able to do it . &quot; &quot; They went far further .
And so , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I
Today , these people are the best ones .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That means that the education changes people .
When you teach people .
( Laughter ) If women had potential women . ( Laughter )
and I &apos;m convinced .
I live in a country that was a good and a good .
Let &apos;s just share with you .
It was a common country .
We could go and we could .
You know what happened from my country ?
Today , people can &apos;t come from houses , not cl@@ unky about safety .
But we want to go back to the old African .
They &apos;re getting their fetus and learn to do it .
So I think it &apos;s going to happen .
I want to share with you with you .
who said that compassion and love can compete .
S@@ H : What do you want ?
K@@ ant : Hmm , let &apos;s look .
S@@ H : It &apos;s a pa@@ ste@@ l@@ actic panic , a lot of the best people in the world , hat@@ tar@@ ers from a combination of a co@@ ve@@ ga , a buff@@ al@@ i , with an o@@ ath , an ap@@ pointment , a piece of salt , and it &apos;s a little bit of bo@@ ast , it &apos;s a little bit from the knee .
K@@ ant : I mean , if my head , I have a lot of emotional memory , and I &apos;m going to write a little bit about the teddy bear .
S@@ H : How are we going to get it ?
And we have a meter on data .
K@@ ant : Let &apos;s go a little bit like this : Don &apos;t get a pan .
SM : It &apos;s faster .
I &apos;m a heart of your job .
( Applause ) Mari@@ e Pal@@ an : I &apos;m a little bit old , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of pressure on my body , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of pressure on the top of my three-@@ year period .
And that &apos;s the same thing I learned from this .
And the mobile phone gave a talk about law enforcement , which most kids don &apos;t know .
When I realized that I@@ V@@ T is the kinds of cartoons I &apos;d like to look at on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an artist . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an antidote to myself . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an artist in my life .
Now , equality and art would always be loved by their parents .
But the curiosity of the computer advances , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ es &quot; &quot; — ( &quot; &quot; My@@ s@@ av@@ es St@@ ars , &quot; &quot; the hum started — my computer was on my computer , I was trying to figure out what I was talking about , and then I thought , &quot; &quot; What if there was a little bit of light in the middle there ?
Now , that &apos;s where they are , where they compete with them ?
So we &apos;ve been born with the United States .
When I was four years old , I said , I &apos;m going to give you a computer to go to the parts and the classroom .
That &apos;s the way I had a computer technology .
I &apos;m going to build the H@@ T@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ C , and I &apos;m going to walk &quot; &quot; Ja@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt , P@@ av@@ ari@@ on , P@@ av@@ at@@ on .
I &apos;ll also build a new vision , which is called &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; neuro@@ logists . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees , and the other people are the ones that have their utility .
If the flowers don &apos;t have those bees , then all of us are acting out of the fact that we &apos;re going to get rid of it .
So I decided to use those files and make them a little bit of superheroes .
( Applause ) ( Grow@@ ling ! ) ( Music ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Dr@@ ums ) It &apos;s still .
It &apos;s going to get a quick .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thanks . ( Applause ) And I started this journey , and I began to think about it .
These states can be inspiring .
There are jobs and new jobs .
And in fact , we have the ideas that are really light up .
If we don &apos;t have ideas , we wouldn &apos;t have been there , there was no tech , there would be no tech , but it would have been a culture , culture , our life .
When I was eight years old , I took my ideas and I discovered the theory of Art Ma@@ ai and the Pro@@ gram to the United States .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to grow a son@@ ar and an actor .
Now , I &apos;m 13 , and I &apos;m still 13 , and I started to see that I started a Ph.D. from 2008 , and I started a lot of cancer .
And I &apos;ve always got to think about my art , and I &apos;d like to help it , and I wanted it to be able to make it , and I &apos;d like to make it work .
And when you look at a piece of paper , I was thinking about this , and I was able to make a balloon , and I had a little bit of design , I had a piece of software .
And I noticed that when I put it , I noticed that I would stop on the street with the question , &quot; How do you jump ? &quot;
And I was thinking that from this , I think , I think , and I think that I could make a firm .
And so I was only eight years old , especially in the course of development .
And I just knew I wanted to grow my way out , and I &apos;d like to share with you , and I &apos;d like to share with you , and I &apos;d like to share with you , and I &apos;ve spent my life .
My mother taught me , and I sat down and I gave my hands on my head , and I &apos;d like to put my hair together , and I &apos;d like to write a little bit about it .
And I began to create more arrangements , like balls , balls and tor@@ ch .
The worst way I started to get around in the world , and I &apos;ve got a message from this , and I &apos;ve got a message from this , U.K. , Australia and other countries .
I mean , I &apos;ve got a lot of friction in terms of leadership terms , like , for example , financial titles and sales , how do you negotiate with the customers and then look at what &apos;s better than that .
The artist &apos;s philosophy started .
And the same time I was 10 years old , I &apos;ve learned from the Time For@@ bes .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me , and I had a funding for my help .
Who is asking me , why would I have inherent ethical ?
With a little bit of age , I wondered , how interesting I was , and the people who lived .
My parents began to think of me as well as a little bit less , and as my parents taught me from the head .
And I &apos;ve learned that I would be able to be able to make it in order to be dangerous for the people and the world , and I began my research , and I found that even after the heart is there , there was a problem with me , and I found that even after I had a heart attack there , there was a problem with me .
With the end of the process , you have a very ten@@ ure of meat , or at the end of the day .
The tape@@ worm is the wind blowing , and it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s all about it .
And so when I started my funding , I knew two things : all I would have had to be echo@@ ed , and that 10 to 20 percent of my eu@@ gen@@ ces is oblig@@ ed , and that &apos;s that 10 to 20 percent .
( Applause ) And I think that I think it &apos;s a part of the invention of innovation , and I think it &apos;s going to make the progress of the world .
I believe that I can only make a handful of customers , but I think that I can give you a lot of people to the future generations .
We live a lot , and we live , and we live in a world , and then I have more to protect it .
There &apos;s rules that come in the world only through your head and think it &apos;s not good enough .
It needs to be a good example of our hearts , because that &apos;s where the idea is going to make it happen .
That &apos;s when the courage and the ingenuity and the invention of the light , so that we can make it happen .
Thank you , everyone and well-being .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : You &apos;ve got a sense of how Ma@@ me speaking about my parents , and they &apos;re also women ?
When a table , spam and spam , you can — wow .
( Applause )
This is a couple of things that come together .
It &apos;s a very humbling decision .
Now , they are the ones that have these great arrangements of their heads connected to them .
Most of the plan@@ ks that you see on the screen — it &apos;s not only the only stars , but it &apos;s a zodiac sign .
And once you &apos;ve got some of these things , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of these things , I think you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a little bit of what it &apos;s about , but I think it &apos;s a lot more than that , but I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s going on , and I think it &apos;s good .
It &apos;s designed to be the tiniest fil@@ m@@ making of the world .
And in your own body , it &apos;s an invitation for &quot; &quot; division &quot; &quot; for the experiments of the experiment that you can bring in .
I think there &apos;s a little bit of gossip , and the first thing that you want to measure is , you know , there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit .
In fact , how big ?
The good thing is , it &apos;s actually to be able to look at each of these things together .
But it &apos;s so much more powerful that the holy thing that comes through , takes it away , takes away from the stress of it .
And when you really look at it , you can see the circle around the world .
It &apos;s not about to be aware of this kind of thing , it &apos;s a little bit more than one million people .
It &apos;s an our@@ nam@@ ent , how much mass can be these systems .
But more than that , what they do is , they &apos;re more powerful .
They &apos;re not the same system as we can , and when you &apos;re lucky , we can think of them as a little bit of about the way we &apos;re talking about breast cancer .
And for a lot of questions that might happen to us , about the whole world , for example , how do you work ?
You &apos;ll be able to study these kinds of learning systems .
So , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about .
The other kind of street — these things have a very garage .
So , when you take a look at the core of your head , and you take all the holy things out there , then you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s a little bit , and then you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s a little bit .
It &apos;s a mess .
That &apos;s what we see here — that &apos;s really the communi@@ cative .
Now , a whole question is : if it &apos;s not a head , what doesn &apos;t even use it , what does it take to eat it ?
And the same thing is gas , gas , in a million degree , is actually the fact of the plasma , the actual plasma .
And I think you can find that in the back of the room .
And the expansion of these systems are the dynamics of the world , and it turns out that we have a lot of variation , but it &apos;s a huge amount of variation , but it &apos;s a ves@@ ic@@ le .
This is the point where it is , but it &apos;s just the same thing .
And it &apos;s also a lot of other ways that we have a lot of other things that we &apos;ve seen before , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;ve done a lot of these things , and we &apos;ve also been able to make our own sense of physics .
Tra@@ vel is a very low .
To tell you about that , I &apos;ve got to tell you about wasting your life .
Most of the world &apos;s wrong is not from the attacks .
You &apos;ve got a date .
Most of the world &apos;s very old , very ta@@ sty .
The beauty of reality is something that &apos;s not really good enough , but it &apos;s not good enough to learn to learn about that .
If you &apos;re wondering about the physics , you wonder what &apos;s going on when we hold something of the value .
And dark stuff isn &apos;t .
So how can we do that ?
And to answer this question , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; What will it be like if you &apos;re not talking about your head ? &quot;
Look at that .
And we remember that our vocal models are the ones that talk about , only by the way to the moon .
They &apos;re going to change with dark materials , and that &apos;s what you see in that tape@@ worm .
C@@ row@@ ds are a garage , and no longer , you can see a lot of lights .
Well , what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s a very , very large extent , which is a very , very big scale .
And it &apos;s really important , because it means that it &apos;s very , very , very little , very little bit of sophistication in the lab , able to be able to eat and learn something that we can see in the position .
So it was really fun .
Now , I think that &apos;s why the vocal issues can teach us about what &apos;s the dark reality , the reason why the vocal issues can teach us about physics , is that they &apos;re so much more likely .
It &apos;s a very bizarre thing .
It &apos;s actually going to reach out .
If there are any more bizarre things , it needs to be dark energy .
When I put the balloon on the wind , I cup it out .
But I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to get a lot more and more quickly .
So , in the way , the way that the universe is speeding up .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s thick@@ er with all of them .
They &apos;re giving it a little bit short of the name , and they &apos;re called the dark energy .
And again , we want to learn more about it .
And so , the question is , &quot; &quot; Oh , the question is , &quot; &quot; which is a question , which is , how dark energy is , how dark energy is going to turn into the world ?
It &apos;s a structure from its bridges , the structure of the bridges , the structure of the language .
And the problem with the universe has a huge amount of sleep .
Let &apos;s look at programmable design .
We need to make it uncomfortable .
I mean , I think it &apos;s about thinking about it , using understanding .
Now , as a sense of view , as much as an important thing is , it &apos;s not a model of the kind of tourism model that was so good .
A big thing is , it &apos;s a very important thing .
So , I can learn a lot about the world &apos;s deepest world , and then the big part of it , and those parts are the ones that are around the world .
And I &apos;m going to end with the audience , but you can feel your path to the rest of the way .
I mean , what I &apos;m seeing with my mind is how much good good about it , and I said , well how do you really use it ?
Well , I want to ask Henry Ford , when he asked the author of Henry Ford .
This is what he said , &quot; &quot; If I asked people what they need , they would say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a very big thing that they have to do , and they would say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a very big problem .
And the solution is not clear .
They &apos;re not the fastest horse .
They &apos;re going to collect the extraordinary numbers of scientific inventions .
So we need to push ourselves , we need to focus , but we also need to think about innovation , but we also need to remember innovation , but we need to think about innovation in terms of ways that we &apos;re going to measure when we look back at them .
And for me , the best way to do it is to learn from the world . Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to the street and say , &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk about this block , and then you say , &quot; &quot; Cho@@ ice , how do you call this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Cho@@ ice . &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the name of a wall , and it &apos;s going to be a block .
It reminds shock , and it reminds us of the sisters . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you call this block ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s no name .
You know , these guys have a name ; blogs is just a concrete table , and it &apos;s just a little bit of it .
This is , and now you &apos;ll imagine that you &apos;re going to go to the street , where you are in Japan , you &apos;re going to go to a friend and you say , &quot; &quot; Excuse me , what do you call this plant ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is a block that &apos;s a block of 17 , and it &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you call it ? &quot; &quot; And then they say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you say that the number of people have names .
There &apos;s names .
Here &apos;s a look at Google Mot@@ ts . There &apos;s a block of 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 , 19 .
Now , all of these are names , and these are the names of these are just a concrete table .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , but how do you know your alls ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s just the &apos; 8 , it &apos;s the &apos; 8 .
There &apos;s a block of 17 , the home one . You say , &quot; &quot; Fa@@ iz@@ an . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Fa@@ iz@@ a . &quot; &quot; But if I walk around , I noticed that I had no idea that there was no way to do that . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not the way that ladies are built .
Home , who was built to the table , is the door of the one one .
Home , who was built , is the home of two .
Your home is the home of the three , it &apos;s simple . &quot; &quot; This is a very clear . &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m really sorry that sometimes we need to go to the next few years , and to understand something that we don &apos;t even forget , and we need to understand that it &apos;s not going to make it happen .
This is for example , in Kenya , there are doctors who believe that their vote is going to make it happen .
So every month , if you don &apos;t throw it away , you &apos;ll notice it , and if you don &apos;t catch it , you don &apos;t have to pay for your work , because they &apos;re not healthy , because they &apos;re not going to be healthy , and they &apos;re rich enough if you &apos;re going .
( Applause ) Now , all of the music in all music , &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; is the same thing , starting with a music sentence . One , two three weeks .
In the south Ath@@ en@@ ian music , &quot; &quot; Once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , for example .
You can hear it not only in the words , but also how they think about it .
And this isn &apos;t true .
( Laughter ) Cal@@ cul@@ ating , in every way that you think about India in terms of India , there is an intermedi@@ ate that &apos;s true .
So , let &apos;s not forget that either TED , or where there is no other thing , it &apos;s an exception to what you hear , it can also be true .
And this is a &quot; &quot; Dou@@ ble Rain@@ master . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a fal@@ li@@ bility .
