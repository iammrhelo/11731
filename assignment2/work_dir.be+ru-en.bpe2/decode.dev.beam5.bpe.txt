( Arabic ) I am in Alabama , like I &apos;m in Alabama , and the name of Alan , mit@@ t and mit@@ otic .
I was born in the middle of my family .
It was five years old when he was injured , and when I was born , I was born .
There was no difference , they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother was born 16 kids .
With 16 kids , only five children died .
You know , it was a picture of a dream .
Now , I &apos;ve seen a lot of women who were talking about their parents , whether they were kids who were going to know their names .
When I ended up in the middle school , I went to the middle school .
I am the doctr@@ ines .
So I ended up having a school .
Sadly , my country has not been the Internet for a girl , and so I was hired to be a college bear , but I couldn &apos;t use it .
And my father came to America .
I moved to America .
I ended my education .
And while I was working , I had a country in my country .
Everywhere I was a writer , I didn &apos;t even know what happened from my family and from my country .
There were months , but I didn &apos;t know anything .
My family was in the camp for be@@ ads .
As soon as I ended up , I gave my family my family in America .
I &apos;m sure that they live in safe .
Was it a mother &apos;s heart ?
My heart was in Africa .
I was in the middle of what &apos;s going on from my country , my mother &apos;s heart .
I &apos;m going to go back to my country , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that , but I knew that not to do that
I &apos;m a good job .
I gave you the teacher to school .
And here I &apos;m going to go to the camp .
When I came to this camp in Beijing , I saw 7@@ ,500 pounds of proteins .
And 90 percent of them were women , and girls were women , and they were women , and they were sick , and when I was in the middle of the be@@ at@@ ers , the men were the women .
I knew things that I &apos;d like to do .
I &apos;ve seen five of the five children who sat and I cried , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I &apos;ve seen a young woman who was not , not by the education party , not an education , not even a place for her life .
I &apos;ve seen a bunch of guys who had lost their parents and their bodies , their bodies , and their bodies .
It was very a@@ dep@@ t .
At that moment , we &apos;re talking about momentum .
And at that moment I gave myself , &quot; What do I do for these people ? &quot;
How do I do it ?
And at that moment , I think that education changed life .
She changed me , gave me the status .
And at that moment , I have to give you the health of education and health , and I work on that .
I mean , what I was like ?
Not because at that moment of education , there was a girl .
And because Ra@@ season I ordered an Afghan country .
And it was to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do it . &quot; &quot; Right ?
Did I tell you ? It &apos;s not .
That &apos;s why I was going to be able to become the finish line .
How did I do this ?
I was angry and I was angry .
I covered .
Y@@ ep , 80 years old .
It was the flour .
I went into it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Look , &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Look , a woman , &quot; &quot; How am I going to be teachers ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m angry with you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m angry with you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And when I was in his case , there was no way that I started with him .
We &apos;ve done 25 schools , and we &apos;ve done 15,000 schools , and 15,000 kids who were in school .
( Applause ) Thank you .
Now , we work , we have a lot of teachers , and we &apos;re going to give you the right of women , right , are right , the principles of repe@@ tition , and then we &apos;re going to give you a partial tri@@ ple@@ ts , and I &apos;ll tell you , you know , we &apos;re going to give you a multi@@ tu@@ de .
And one day I was at the office in Pe@@ ñ@@ a , P@@ ac@@ ra@@ stan .
And I saw this as my father and my father , and I found myself yelling , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , you go . &quot; &quot; When you are , you know what you &apos;re doing ?
You suck . Everywhere it is dangerous .
You know , in your life .
But you have to be male .
You need to do it .
I said , what &apos;s going on ?
So I got them .
They went . Nine of them .
( Laughter ) You know , there are people who are passionate about people . ( Laughter )
I gave them a lot of them , and I gave them a closet .
They said that the closet was not going to be .
N@@ one@@ theless , their voice , the voice they talked to me , I was very , very quickly .
But I was a sop@@ hom@@ ore , though .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
What are you doing right now ? &quot; &quot; Everywhere I get them off — ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to give you a little girl here . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to give you a little girl here .
We are the bene@@ fici@@ aries .
And the Koran says that when you put the Ka@@ il@@ re in the woman — ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And they began to talk to the pub .
And at that moment , I was going to put it back together , and they came up and they began to match .
There was no way she started coming out .
We put 3,000 of them together , and we put 3,000 of them together .
There was rules .
With mother and children .
There was rules about health care .
We have all the tri@@ tives that you can only imagine .
I was fortunate . I was happily thinking .
The first four , one of the four , and I went on to the Whit@@ ley House , and I went on , and we stopped talking about 19 parents .
With flowers on the beaches , they were turning to us .
And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And my father went out and said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you what it is .
What you need ?
And that time , we have all these .
And yet , it &apos;s a point where it &apos;s going to be a good thing .
We@@ ats , you &apos;ve got it .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
Now , when you &apos;re going from the point where you &apos;re going from now , you &apos;re going to make it .
And I came up and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll have to drive . &quot; &quot; And I went into the machine , and I sat in my car .
It &apos;s about to fix them in school , not what the other thing is .
There was no one left .
And I was just a specialist . I lost my voice .
I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; I said ,
There were hundreds of women in order to make education .
So , I sat down , and I &apos;m not talking about the game — at this point , we talk about the momentum — at this point , in this particular episode of the Sun &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Gra@@ du@@ ate , &quot; &quot; at this point .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sa@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; And I was alone .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What ?
But if you don &apos;t wait , it ain &apos;t broken .
You &apos;ll be able to help them . &quot; &quot; They found themselves .
And so , I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I
Today , these people are the best ones .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It tells you that education is changing .
When you teach people .
( Laughter ) If women had potential women . ( Laughter )
and I &apos;m convinced .
I live in a country that was a good and a good .
I &apos;m just going to share with you .
It was a common country .
We could go and we could .
Everywhere from my country ?
Today , people can &apos;t come from houses , not cl@@ unky about safety .
But we want to go back to the old African .
They &apos;re doing smoke and science .
So I think it &apos;s going to happen .
I want to share with you with you .
who said that compassion and love can be bent .
St@@ and@@ ering is : Ch@@ r@@ ass pa@@ eds ?
K@@ ant : Hmm , let &apos;s look .
S@@ H : It &apos;s a place that sp@@ ins a lot of people like S@@ H , which is the best wis@@ est breeding of the edges , the hal@@ ore@@ s of the Po@@ e@@ do , the co@@ ots of the organic , the collar , the collar , the prop@@ ell@@ ant of the fence with the police station , and the b@@ ends of the stones .

And we have the height of the stars .

I &apos;m my heart .
( Applause ) Mari@@ e Pal@@ an : I &apos;m a little bit old , and I think it &apos;s a little bit old , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a little bit old . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) Now , I &apos;m a little bit skin@@ ni@@ vo@@ res in my life .
And then I knew that I knew who the characters are .
There was a lot of people who have been talking about law enforcement , which most kids don &apos;t know .
Now , when I think the characters are the kinds of cartoons that I like to look at on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an artist . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an artist . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an antidote to myself .
It &apos;s an illusion of equality , and arti@@ stry , you know .
But the curiosity of the computer advances , the idea of innovation , is &quot; &quot; The Magic Par@@ ks , &quot; &quot; the hum started — my computer was on my computer , I tried to say , &quot; &quot; Oh my computer , &quot; &quot; I was trying to figure out what I was going to talk about , and that when there was a little bit of light in the middle there there was a computer ?
Now , that &apos;s where they are , where they compete with them ?
So we &apos;ve been born with the United States .
When I was about four years old , I &apos;m going to give you a computer to go to the parts and the classroom .
That &apos;s the way I had a computer technology .
I &apos;m going to build the H@@ T@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ C , and I &apos;m going to walk &quot; &quot; Ja@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt , P@@ av@@ ari@@ on , P@@ av@@ at@@ on .
I also have a new prophec@@ y that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The Ab@@ vol@@ ts . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators that they have in their economy and why they &apos;re useful .
If the flowers don &apos;t have those bees , then all of the wel@@ ters , all of a sudden , we &apos;re going to get rid of it .
So I decided to use those files and make them a little bit of superheroes .
( Applause ) ( Grow@@ ling ! ) ( Music ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Dr@@ ums ) It &apos;s still .
It &apos;s going to get a little bit like this .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thanks . ( Applause ) And I started this journey , and I began to think about it .
It can happen .
It &apos;s the same thing , it &apos;s the same thing .
Thank you very much .
If we don &apos;t have ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be there , we wouldn &apos;t be there yet , we wouldn &apos;t have a technology or a culture , it would have no purpose , culture , culture .
When I was eight years old , I took my ideas and I discovered the theory of Art Ma@@ ai and the Pro@@ gram to the United States .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to grow a son@@ ar and an actor .
Now , I &apos;m 13 , and this is the fact that I &apos;m 13 , and I &apos;m convinced that I &apos;m a Ph.D. from 2008 , and my mother evolved to grow a lot .
And I think of the fact that I had the courage to come up with my art , and I think I &apos;m going to make it all the way I do , including my funding .
And while you know , you know , you know , you know , I was going to take a step back , and I was able to make a balloon — I had a little bit of science .
And I noticed that when I put it , I noticed that I would stop on the street with the question , &quot; How do you jump ? &quot;
And I think that I was thinking from that , and I think that I could make a funding .
And so I was only eight years old , especially in particular , especially for me .
And I just knew I wanted to grow my way out , and I &apos;d like to say goodbye to my friends , and that I had to share with each other , and that I had to share my life .
My mother taught me , and I sat down behind my bow and I gave my hair to my head , and I &apos;d like to write a little bit about it , and I &apos;d like to write a little bit about it .
And I &apos;m creating more expressions , like balls , balls and tor@@ ch .
The worst way I started to get around in the world , and I &apos;ve got a message from this , and I &apos;ve got a message from this , U.K. , Australia and other countries .
I mean , I &apos;ve got a lot of friction in terms of leadership terms , like , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; and sell the relationship with the customer and sell the relationships with the customers and then get the better off what &apos;s going on .
The mentor of California .
And the same time I was 10 years old , I broke my book .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me , and I had a funding for my help .
Who is asking me , why would I have inherent ethical ?
With a little bit of age , I was wondering , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; &quot; I was curious , and &quot; &quot; I think it was a little bit , and I think it was a little bit , and I think it was a little bit , and that &apos;s what I found out .
My parents began to teach me from the other side of the world , as well as a little bit less , and from the ro@@ dents and the ro@@ dents and the roles of our parents .
And I &apos;ve learned that I would be grateful for the people to be wrong , even though it &apos;s dangerous for people , and I &apos;ve learned that even after the heart is there , there is a problem that even then , even after the heart is there , there is a problem with what I &apos;ve learned from the rest of my life .
With the end of the process , you have a very ten@@ ure of meat , or at the end of the day .
The sun is blowing , it &apos;s so powerful to all of them , and then it &apos;s a lot of them as well .
So when I fail , I knew two things : all of the things I would say that all of my work should be esoteric , and that 10 percent of my last year , I have to sacrifice the local and the world .
( Applause ) And I think that I think it &apos;s a part of the invention of wisdom that &apos;s not only willing to make money , but also the development of the development of the world .
I believe that I can make a handful of customers , and I believe that we need to do a lot more flexi@@ bly , and then I believe that the future of profits are more evolution@@ arily .
We live a lot , and we live , and we live in a whole world , and then I have more to protect it .
There &apos;s rules that come in the world only through your head and think of it .
We need to have a problem with our hearts , because it makes an idea that we think about it .
And that &apos;s when the future of innovation and ingenuity and discovery , we have the idea .
Thank you , everyone and well-being .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You &apos;ve got a sense of how Ma@@ me speaking about my parents , in China , women ?
When a table , spam and spam , you can — wow .
( Applause )
This is a couple of things that come together .
It &apos;s a very humbling lesson .
These are the ones that have these great arrangements of galaxies , they &apos;re the ones that are frozen together .
Most of the edges you have on the screen — it &apos;s not only the only stars , but the zodiac sign , or your head .
Now , when you say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to give you the message of what you &apos;re all about , but it &apos;s not just the same thing , but I think it &apos;s more than that , but I think it &apos;s about , I think , in terms of ways that we &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s like the deepest world &apos;s deepest world .
And in my art , it &apos;s not about giving people a bunch of people that you can take over them .
I think there &apos;s a lot of gossip that we have , and that &apos;s what we think about to measure , it &apos;s a little bit wrong .
In fact , how big ?
The good thing is , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a lot of shame about this .
But it &apos;s so much more powerful that the holy thing that comes through , takes it away , takes away from the stress of it .
And when you really think about it , you can see the circle around the world .
Now , we don &apos;t have a source of identity , no matter how much more than one million people .
It &apos;s an our@@ nam@@ ent , how much mass can be these systems .
But more than that , what they &apos;re about .
They &apos;re not the same system as we can , and when you &apos;re lucky , we can think of them as a little bit of what we &apos;re talking about .
And for a lot of questions that might happen to us , about the history of the universe , then , as a matter of magnitude ?
You &apos;ll be able to study these kinds of learning systems .
So , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about .
The other kind of street — these things have a very garage .
So , when you take a look at the core of your head , and all of the connec@@ tors that are drawn to the stars , then you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s a little bit , right ?
It &apos;s a mess .
That &apos;s what we see here — that &apos;s really the communi@@ cative .
Now , a whole question is : if it &apos;s not a head , what doesn &apos;t even make it , which is how it doesn &apos;t make it so much more than anything else .
And the same thing is gas , gas , in a million degree , is actually the fact of the plasma , the actual plasma .
And I think you can find that in the back of the room .
And the expansion of these systems are the dynamics of the world , and it turns out that we have a lot of variation , but it &apos;s a huge amount of variation , but it &apos;s a ves@@ ic@@ le .
This is the point where it is , but it &apos;s just the same thing .
And it &apos;s also a lot of other ways that we have a lot of these plans that we have , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;ve also been able to make our sense that we &apos;re going to be able to make our own sense of physics .
It &apos;s a very , very low .
And I have to tell you that I &apos;m going to talk about prisons as well .
Most of the world &apos;s wrong is not from the attacks .
You &apos;ve got a date .
Most of the time , you know , it &apos;s a lot of cool stuff .
The beauty of reality is something that &apos;s not very good for us , but it &apos;s not good enough , we &apos;ll have to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re wondering about the physics , you wonder what &apos;s going on when we hold something together .
And dark stuff isn &apos;t .
So how can we do that ?
Now , I &apos;m going to answer that question , and I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; What will it be if you &apos;re not talking about your head ? &quot;
Look at that .
Well , we remember that the vocal issues are the ones that talk about , only by the way to the moon .
They &apos;re going to change with the dark content , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done in that tape@@ worm .
C@@ row@@ ds are a garage , and no longer , you can see a lot of lights .
Well , what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s a very , very large extent , which is a very , very big scale .
And it &apos;s really important , because it &apos;s something that &apos;s very , very , very little , really , very young , that we can see in the lab that we can see in the position .
So it was really fun .
Now , I think that &apos;s why the vocal issues can teach us about what &apos;s the dark reality , and the reason why the vocal issues can teach us about physics is a very small thing that they &apos;re so big .
It &apos;s a very bizarre thing .
This is the whole thing .
If there &apos;s any other thing , it should be dark energy .
When I fall off the wind , I &apos;m reminded that it &apos;s a se@@ c of the coal .
But I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be the way it &apos;s going to get sick and faster .
So , in the way , the way that the universe is speeding up .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s thick@@ er with all of them .
They &apos;re giving it a little bit short of the name , and they &apos;re called the dark energy .
And again , we have to learn more about it .
Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; The question is , &quot; &quot; which is a question , which is , how dark energy is , how dark energy is going to be in the world ?
It &apos;s a structure from its bridges , the structure of the bridges , the structure of the language .
And the problem with the universe is that it &apos;s about sleep sleep .
Let &apos;s look at programmable design .
We &apos;re not doing it .
I mean , I think it &apos;s about sharing analogy .
It &apos;s like , in terms of thinking , like , you know , it &apos;s not a single kind of thing to be the kind of place you see in every small little piece of cap@@ tivity .
A big thing is , it &apos;s a very important thing .
So , I can learn a lot about the world &apos;s deepest world , and then the big part of it , and those parts are the ones that are around the world .
I &apos;m going to end with my own selves , but you can feel like you &apos;re going .
I mean , what I &apos;m seeing with my mind is how much more useful it is , and I think of it , but how do we really do it ?
Well , let me ask Henry Ford , when he was asked by the author of Henry Ford .
This is what he says , &quot; &quot; If I asked people what they need , they need to be the fastest competi@@ tiveness of the problem .
And the solution is not clear .
They &apos;re not the fastest horse .
They have extraordinary numbers of scientific inventions .
So we &apos;re going to think about innovation , but we also need to think about innovation , but we also need to remember innovation , but we also need to remember innovation , but we &apos;re going to think about innovation in terms of ways that we look forward to .
And for me , the best way to do it is to learn from the world . Thank you .

So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to the street and say , &quot; Well , you know , I &apos;m going to say , how do you call this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Cho@@ ice . &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the name of a wall , and it &apos;s going to be a block .
It reminds shock , and it reminds us of the whole village . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you call this block ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Everywhere there was no name .
There &apos;s a lot of cool stuff ; there &apos;s blogs — it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s just like the blockchain is , and it &apos;s gone .
This is , and now you &apos;ll imagine that you &apos;re going to go to the street , where you are in Japan , you &apos;re going to go to the floor and you say , &quot; &quot; Excuse me , how do you call this plant ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is a block that &apos;s a block of 17 , and it &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you call it ? &quot; &quot; And then they say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you say that the number of people have names .
There &apos;s names .
Here &apos;s a look at Google Mot@@ ts . There &apos;s a block of 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 , 19 .
Now , all of these are names . There &apos;s names , it &apos;s just the same thing .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , but how do you know your alls ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s just the &apos; 8 , it &apos;s the &apos; 8 .
There &apos;s a block of 17 , the home one . You say , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s , &quot; &quot; but you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m on . &quot; &quot; But if I walk around , I noticed that I had no idea that in the middle of the zero . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; This is not the way that ladies are built .
Home , who was built to the table , is the door of the one one .
Home , who was built , is the home of two .
The home is the top three . It &apos;s simple . &quot; &quot; This is a very clear . &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m really freaking out that sometimes we have to go to each other , and we need to understand that we don &apos;t even forget , and we need to understand that we can &apos;t even understand it , and to understand that it &apos;s not going to make it happen .
This is the doctors in Silicon Valley , who are the doctors who believed that their health .
So every month , if you don &apos;t throw it away , you &apos;ll see them , and if you don &apos;t throw it out , you &apos;re not at the third thing , because they &apos;re not healthy , because they &apos;re not healthy , and they &apos;re rich enough when you &apos;re going , and you get sick .
( Applause ) Now , all of the music in all music , &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; is the same thing , the music of the music , the beginning of the music .
In the south Ath@@ en@@ ian music , &quot; &quot; Once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , for example .
You can hear it not only in the words , but also how they think about it .
And this is the same thing .
( Laughter ) Cal@@ cul@@ ating , in fact , is that in every single truth , there is no way to think about it .
So , let &apos;s not forget that either TED , or where there is no other thing , it &apos;s an exception to what you hear , it can also be true .
