( Arabic ) I mean , I &apos;m in Alabama , like I am in Alabama , in the name of Algeria , Alabama and health .
I was born in the middle of my family .
It was five years old , and when I was born , I was born .
There was no difference , they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother was born 16 kids .
With 16 kids only come alive .
There was a picture that was a dream .
Now , I &apos;ve seen a lot of women who were talking about their parents , or their kids , who were going to measure their names .
When I finish the middle school ,
I am the doctr@@ ines .
So I ended up starting school .
Sadly , my country has not been the Internet for a girl , so I was hired to be a college bear , but I couldn &apos;t use it .
And my father came to America .
I moved to America .
I ended my education .
And while I &apos;ve been working , I have a country in my country .
Everywhere I was a writer , I didn &apos;t even know what happened from my family and from my country .
There were months , but I didn &apos;t know anything .
My family was in the camp for be@@ ads .
As soon as I ended up , I went to my family in America .
I &apos;m sure that they live in safe .
Was it a mother &apos;s heart ?
My heart was in Africa .
I was in the middle of what &apos;s happening from my country , my mother &apos;s heart .
I &apos;m going to go back to my country , but I knew that not to do that .
I &apos;m a good job .
I picked up the teacher .
And here I go to the camp .
When I came to this camp in Beijing , I saw 7@@ ,500 pounds of be@@ gs . 7@@ ,500 .
And 90 percent of them were women , and girls were women , and they were women , and they were sick .
I knew things that I &apos;d like to do .
I saw it from five to eight kids who sat and I cried , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I &apos;ve seen a young woman who was not rejected , not by education , not an education , not even a place for life .
I &apos;ve seen a bunch of guys who had lost their parents and their homes , their bodies , and their bodies , and their bodies .
It was very a@@ dep@@ t .
At that moment , we &apos;re talking about momentum .
And at that moment I gave myself , &quot; What do I do for these people ? &quot;
How do I do it ?
And at that moment , I think that education changed life .
She changed me , gave me the status .
And at that moment , I have to give you the health of education and health , and I work on that .
What I was like ?
Not because at that moment of education , there was a girl .
And because Ra@@ season I ordered an Afghan country .
And it was to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do it . &quot; &quot; Right ?
Have you ever killed me ?
That &apos;s why I was going to be able to become the finish line .
How did I do this ?
I was angry and I was angry .
I covered .
Y@@ ep , 80 years old .
It was the flour .
I went into it .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; Look , &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m angry with you ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m angry with you a teacher . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a teacher from you . &quot; &quot; And when I was in his head , there was no way I started .
There was a year after we &apos;ve done 25 schools , and 15,000 kids in schools , and 15,000 kids in school .
( Applause ) Thank you .
In fact , we work , we have a lot of teachers , we put them together , and we give you the right of women , right , right , the kinds of things we &apos;re doing .
And one day I was at the office in Pe@@ ñ@@ a , P@@ acting .
And I saw this as my father and my father , and I found myself yelling , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , you go . &quot; &quot; When you say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , you know what you do ?
You suck . Everywhere it is dangerous .
You know it &apos;s your life .
But you have to be male .
You need to do it .
I said , what &apos;s going on ?
So I got them .
They went . Nine of them .
( Laughter ) Different people .
I gave them a lot of them , and I pushed them down .
They said that the closet was not going to be .
N@@ one@@ theless , their voice , the voice they talked to me , I was very , very quickly .
But I wasn &apos;t fully married .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
What you &apos;re doing here ?
I mean , we &apos;re the bene@@ fici@@ aries .
And the Q@@ ur@@ an tells us that when you leave the Ka@@ il@@ re of the woman , ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And they started talking to the pub .
And at that moment , I was going to put it back together , and they came up and began to match .
My opponents started coming out .
We put 3,000 of them together , and we put 3,000 together .
There was rules .
With mother and children .
There was rules about health care .
We have all the tri@@ tives that you can only imagine .
I was fortunate . I was happy .
There was four thirds , one of the four , and I went to the Whit@@ ley House , and there was no way we stopped talking about 19 parents .
With flowers on the beaches , they were turning to us .
I asked them , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And my father went out and said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you what it is .
What you need ?
And this time , we have all these .
And yet , at the end of the moment , when you have to be in the world , you have to be a good thing .
We@@ ats , you &apos;ve got it .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
( Laughter ) Now , when you &apos;re going from the point where you &apos;re going from the point where you &apos;re going from now , you &apos;re going to do it .
And I went and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ll have to drive . &quot; &quot; And I went into the machine , sat in a car , sat down .
To leave them in school , what the other thing is .
There was no one left .
Pe@@ ers me only . I lost the voice .
I said , &quot; What should I do ? &quot;
There were hundreds of women to make education .
So , I sat down , and I &apos;m not talking about the game — at this point , we talk about the momentum — at this point , we talk about the momentum — at this point , from the beginning of the Sun .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sa@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; And I was alone .
She said , &quot; &quot; It ain &apos;t you . What ?
But it doesn &apos;t panic me .
You &apos;ll be able to do it . &quot; &quot; They did .
And so I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said
Today , these people are the best ones .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It tells us that education is changing .
When you teach people .
( Laughter ) The potential of women .
and I &apos;m convinced .
I live in a country that was a good and a good .
Let me share with you .
It was a common country .
We were able to tell , we wanted to .
Everywhere from my country ?
Today , people can &apos;t come from houses , not cl@@ unky about safety .
But we want to go back to the old-fashioned Afghan .
They &apos;re doing smoke and science .
So I think it &apos;s going to happen .
I want to share with you .
who said that compassion and love can be bent .
St@@ and@@ ering is : Ch@@ r@@ ow ?
K@@ ant : Hmm , let &apos;s look .
S@@ H : It &apos;s kind of like S@@ H , which is the best of the fr@@ ing@@ es of the Sun , the hal@@ ore@@ s of the gang@@ lia , the prop@@ ellers , the prop@@ ell@@ ant , the prop@@ on@@ ents , the prop@@ ellers , the prop@@ he@@ ts from the state of the sea floor , and the b@@ ends of the stones .
K@@ ant : I mean , if my head , I &apos;ve got an emotional memory , and I &apos;m going to go to the best of my cat .
SM : Sh@@ ind@@ sight ?
We have the height of the stars .
K@@ ant : Let &apos;s give you the Fu@@ ture of the Fu@@ ture of the Fu@@ ture , the nit@@ r@@ ash .
SM : It &apos;s faster .
I heart your job .
( Applause ) Mari@@ e Pal@@ an : I &apos;m a little bit old from a couple of years old , and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a little bit old , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a little bit old .
And that &apos;s the same thing I learned .
And there was a lot of people who were talking about law enforcement , which most kids don &apos;t know .
When I think that the characters are the kinds of cartoons that I like to look at on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an artist . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an atheist ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an artist in my life .
It &apos;s an illusion of equality , and arti@@ stry , you know .
But the curiosity of the computer technology changed the concept of publishing &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ es . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) My computer was on my computer , and I was doing it , and I would say , &quot; &quot; What if there was a little bit of light in the middle there ?
Now , that &apos;s where they compete , where they compete with them ?
So we &apos;ve been born with the United States .
When I was four years old , I &apos;m going to give you a computer to go to the parts and the classroom .
That &apos;s the way I had a computer technology .
I &apos;m going to build the H@@ T@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ C , and I &apos;m going to walk &quot; &quot; Ja@@ va@@ S@@ cri@@ pt , P@@ av@@ ari@@ on , P@@ av@@ at@@ on .
I also have a new vision of what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; As@@ vol@@ ts . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other pollinators that they have , and why they &apos;re useful .
If the flowers don &apos;t have those bees , then all of a sudden , all of a sudden , we &apos;re going to get rid of it .
So I decided to use those files and make them a little bit of superheroes .
( Applause ) ( Grow@@ ling ! ) ( Music ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Grow@@ ling ) ( Dr@@ ums ) It &apos;s still .
It &apos;s going to get rid of the world .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) And I started this journey , but what is the idea ?
It can happen .
And it &apos;s also the same thing .
Thank you very much .
If we don &apos;t have ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be there , we wouldn &apos;t be there yet , we wouldn &apos;t be able to have a technology or a culture , a culture , a life .
When I was eight years old , I had an idea , and I gave him an idea , and I said to him , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s also &quot; &quot; Act &quot; &quot; to the United States .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to grow a son@@ ar and an actor .
Now , I &apos;m 13 , and it &apos;s not that I &apos;m 13 , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve done since 2008 , my mother evolved to evolve .
And I think of the fact that I &apos;ve learned about my art , and I think I &apos;m going to make it work , and I think it &apos;s my firm .
You know , a friend of mine , a friend of hers , and I was thinking about this , and I was able to make a balloon — I had a little bit of science .
And I noticed that when I put it , I would stop on the street with the question , &quot; How do you jump . &quot;
And I began to think that from this , I think , I think of it , and I think of it .
And so I was only eight years old , especially in particular , especially for me .
I just knew I wanted to make a decision I &apos;m going to grow up , and that I &apos;d like to share with my friends , and that I had my favorite life .
My mother taught me , and I sat down behind my bow and I gave my hair to my head , and I &apos;d like to write my pants down to my head .
I mean , I &apos;m creating more expressions , like the balls , the balloons and the tor@@ ch .
The worst would have begun to get around the world , and I &apos;ve got the names of the next , and the Chinese and the U.K. and the countries .
I mean , I &apos;m going to have a lot of friction in terms of leadership terms , like , &quot; &quot; Oh , Con@@ a , &quot; &quot; as well as maintaining relationships from the clinic and to help , for what it &apos;s better than .
The artist &apos;s philosophy .
And the same time I was 10 years old , I went off to the marshmallow .
( Laughter ) And they wanted to write about me , and I had a funding .
Who is asking me , why would I have ethical ?
With a little bit of age , I was wondering , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; &quot; I was wondering , &quot; &quot; You know what ? &quot; &quot; With a little bit of insight , there was a lot of people who lived .
My parents began to teach me from the other side of my head , a little less tor@@ que , and the roles of my parents &apos; heads .
And what I &apos;ve learned is that , in fact , what I &apos;ve learned is that even beyond the heart of the people and the world , I &apos;ve learned that even after the heart , even after the heart is there , there is a problem with what I &apos;ve learned from the place .
With the end of the process , you have a very ten@@ ure of meat , or at the end of the day .
The other thing is that the wind takes the wind , and the rest of it , and it &apos;s all of them .
And so when I was carto@@ oning , I knew two things : all I would have to be echo@@ ed , and that 10 to 20 percent of my last year , I have to sacrifice a local and conservative organization .
( Applause ) And I think that I think it &apos;s a part of the invention of innovation , but it &apos;s also the development of the development of the world .
I believe that I can only make a handful of customers , but by the end of the world , I believe that we &apos;re going to have a much more scientific job .
We live a lot , and we live , and we live in a world , and then I have more to protect it .
There &apos;s rules that come in the world only through your head and think of it .
We need to take care of our hearts , because it makes an idea that we think about it .
And that &apos;s what the courage and ingenuity and invention look like .
Thank you , everyone and well-being .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : You &apos;ve got a sense of how Ma@@ me speaking about my parents , in China , women ?
When a table , spam and spam , you can .
( Applause )
This is a couple of things that come together .
It &apos;s a very humbling lesson .
These are the ones that have these great arrangements of galaxies , they &apos;re the ones that are connected to them .
Most of the edges you have on the screen — it &apos;s not only the only stars , but the zodiac sign , or your head .
And when you say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , &quot; &quot; I believe that you &apos;re a TEDster , you know , it &apos;s not only affecting you , but more than that , I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s about , but I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s about , and I think it &apos;s good .
The deepest world is the deepest world .
And in your body , it &apos;s a laboratory , and it &apos;s not talking about it .
I think there &apos;s a little bit of gossip , and I think that there &apos;s no way to measure , it &apos;s a little bit wrong .
What happened ?
The good thing is , it &apos;s got to be found by the son@@ ian .
And so it &apos;s so much more powerful that the holy thing that comes through , takes away , takes away from the stress of it .
And when you really think about it , you can see the circle around the world .
We don &apos;t have a source of identity , no matter how much more than one million people .
It &apos;s an our@@ nam@@ ent , how much mass can be these systems .
But more than that , what they &apos;re about .
They &apos;re not the same systems that we &apos;re talking about , and when you &apos;re lucky , we can think of them as a better version of the world .
And for a lot of questions that might happen to us , about the history of the universe , then , as a matter of magnitude ?
You &apos;ll be able to study these kinds of learning systems .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about .
Second , these things have a very garage .
So , when you take a look at the core of your head , and all of the connec@@ tors that are drawn to the stars , then you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s a little bit , right ?
It &apos;s a mess .
That &apos;s what we see here — that &apos;s really the gift of the sacred .
And the whole question is : if it &apos;s not a head , what doesn &apos;t even use it .
And one thing that &apos;s going to happen is gas , gas , in a million degree , is actually the fact of the plasma .
And I think you can find that in the back of the room .
And the expansion of these systems of these systems include the Higgs boson , and it turns out that there &apos;s a huge amount of variation , but it &apos;s a ves@@ ic@@ le , it &apos;s a ves@@ ic@@ le .
This is the core of the meaning , but it &apos;s just the same thing .
And it &apos;s also a lot of other ways that we have a little bit of what we &apos;ve done , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve also been able to make sense that we &apos;re going to be able to make our own sense of physics .
It &apos;s a very , very low .
And I have to tell you about that , and I need to tell you about remembering why .
Most of the world &apos;s wrong is not from attack .
You &apos;ve got a date .
Most of the cri@@ tic@@ isms is , you know , what we call dark materials .
The beauty of math is something that &apos;s not really good enough , but it &apos;s not good enough , we can learn to learn more about it .
When you &apos;re wondering about the physics , you wonder what &apos;s going on when we hold something together .
And dark stuff isn &apos;t .
So how can we do that ?
And the answer to this question , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; What will it be , if you don &apos;t have the core of your head ? &quot;
Look at it .
Well , we remember that the vocal issues of the world are the ones that are biased , only by grades .
They &apos;re going to change with the dark content , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done in that tape@@ worm .
C@@ row@@ ds are a garage , and no longer , you can see a lot of lights .
Well , what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s a very , very large extent , which is a very , very big scale .
And it &apos;s really important , because it &apos;s something that &apos;s very , very , very low in the lab , and it &apos;s able to stick with something that we can see in the position .
So it was really fun .
Now , I think that &apos;s why the vocal issues can teach us about what the dark reality is , and the reason why the vocal issues can teach us about the physics of physics is that they &apos;re so much bigger .
It &apos;s a very bizarre thing .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
If there &apos;s any other thing , it needs to be dark energy .
When I put the balloon on the wind , I think it &apos;s a se@@ c of the coal .
But I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s going to be the way it &apos;s going to get sick and faster .
So , in the way , the way that the universe is speeding up .
They don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s thick@@ er with all of them .
They &apos;re giving it a little bit short , and they have a dark energy .
And then we think about it again .
Now , the question is , &quot; &quot; The question is , &quot; &quot; which is the question , which is , how dark energy is , how dark energy is going to be in the world ?
There &apos;s a lot of moisture from it , the structure of it , the structure of its bridges , faster than men .
And the problem with the universe has a huge amount of sleep .
Let &apos;s look at programmable design .
We &apos;re embarrassed .
I mean , I think it &apos;s about sharing analogy .
Well , in terms of thinking , like , you know , it &apos;s not a single kind of thing to be a kind of kind of thing in terms of every little bit of a tiny piece of cap@@ tivity .
A more important thing is , it &apos;s a very important thing .
So I can learn a lot about the world &apos;s deepest world , and then the tiniest part of the world , and those parts are the ones that are about .
You know , I &apos;m going to end my mind , but you can feel like you &apos;re going .
I mean , what I &apos;m seeing with my mind is how much more useful it is , and I think of it , but how do we really do it ?
Well , let me ask Henry Ford , when he was asked by the author , &quot; &quot; I asked Henry Ford .
This is what he says , &quot; &quot; If I was asking people what they need , they need to be the fastest competi@@ tiveness of the problem .
And the solution is not clear .
They &apos;re not the fastest horse .
They have extraordinary numbers of scientific inventions .
So we think we &apos;re going to think about innovation , but we also need remembering innovation , but we also need to remember innovation , but we also need to remember innovation , but we &apos;re going to think about innovation in terms of ways that we bring back together .
And I think the best way to do that is to learn from the world . Thank you .
( Applause )
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to go to the street and say , &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to talk about this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Cho@@ ice . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a wall , and it &apos;s a wall , and it &apos;s going .
It reminds shock , and it reminds us of our sisters . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you call this block ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Everywhere there was no name .
You know , there &apos;s a lot of cool stuff ; there &apos;s a lot of cool stuff up there . &quot; &quot; He goes , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s gone , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s gone .
This is , and now you &apos;ll imagine that you &apos;re going to go to the street , where you are in Japan , you &apos;re going to go to the floor and you say , &quot; &quot; Excuse me , how do you call this plant ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is a block that &apos;s a block of 17 , and it &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you call this plant ? &quot; &quot; And then they say , &quot; &quot; Well , how do you say that ?
There &apos;s names .
Here &apos;s a look at Google Mot@@ ts . Here &apos;s 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 , 17 , 19 .
These are the names of all these blog names . These are the ones that are just about .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s okay , but how do you know your own kind of drama ? &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s just a simple thing .
There &apos;s a block of 17 , the home number one , and you say , &quot; &quot; Absolutely . &quot; &quot; But if I walk around , I noticed that in the middle , I noticed that there was no way to go in there .
Home , who was built to the table with the first one .
Home , who was built , is the home of two .
The home is the top three . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s clear . &quot; &quot; Well , I really like that .
This is , in Kenya , there are doctors who believe that their health is going to make it .
So every month , if you don &apos;t throw it away , you &apos;re a swi@@ mmer , and if you don &apos;t catch it , you &apos;re not a third of them , because they &apos;re not healthy , but they &apos;re rich enough if you &apos;re old , not when you &apos;re catching up .
( Applause ) Now , in all music , everybody &apos;s music is saying , &quot; &quot; One of the things we &apos;re doing is the music of the music . &quot; &quot; One , two three weeks .
And in the midst of Ath@@ en@@ ian music , &quot; &quot; Once &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &quot; &quot; is the end of the sentence , for example .
You can hear it , not only in the words , but also how they think about it .
And this is the same thing .
( Laughter ) Cal@@ cul@@ ating , in fact , is that in every single part of the truth that we think about it , it &apos;s also true .
So , let &apos;s not forget that if you &apos;re at TED , or where you &apos;re still , it &apos;s not an exception of what you want to say , and it can also be true .
Well , this is a &quot; &quot; Dou@@ ble Rain@@ master . &quot; &quot; There &apos;s a fal@@ li@@ bility .
