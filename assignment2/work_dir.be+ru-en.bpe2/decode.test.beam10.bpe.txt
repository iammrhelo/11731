Now , this is going to be about a million people that are active at the end of the year .
All of them , all of them , is what they &apos;re going to die .
And while that &apos;s a good idea , but I think it &apos;s a really cool way to think about it .
And I think that I think of it after a month in Dan &apos;s blog , J@@ r. , Engine@@ ering , a literary scholar who died from cancer .
Ma@@ stery of her family and sister wrote a mystery in the name of his death .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh . I &apos;m going to die , and that &apos;s my last post .
I mean , I &apos;ve got to say , as only my family to get rid of the cancer , my family and friends say , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; &quot; which is the first part of my blog that I have , as part of an effective part of my blog , an active part of an effective part of my blog from an active degree , and she &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I think it &apos;s a lot better than a magazine , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done
It &apos;s a little bit old .
The 48 hours of ink are uploaded to YouTube .
Six hundred thousand other people .
There &apos;s a lot of people using Facebook on Facebook , which means 90 alone per month .
If you think about your parents or your grandparents &apos; best , you &apos;ve created a series of photos that have been created by a couple of photos , whether you &apos;re sitting in a little bit of hiding or walking in the pockets of hide .
But today , we are creating the prosperity of the richness that is going to live in the same way that we die .
And I think that it creates a multi@@ tu@@ de of the potential for the performance .
I &apos;m a magazine , I &apos;m a magazine , not a test , because I &apos;d like to give you a sense of stress and the future self .
We are at the top of the heart of the heart , which allows us to think that we &apos;re going to be able to be with our ri@@ vets and the dollars in our sal@@ ma .
And one day one of them , the last year , I found myself in the morning in the morning at the same time .
( Audio ) Adam : Love .
Death : Adam ?
A : Yeah .
&quot; &quot; Death can &apos;t happen in every place in place , even Ar@@ gu@@ ed .
A : Right ?
Death : It was f@@ uss about it .
( Laughter ) A : sleep , isn &apos;t it true ?
This is the heart of your heart , your heart , your voice or your heart or your heart or your heart .
My mother has a total of 1,000 spam .
He was online saying , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; and then it &apos;s going to work with these pictures , and it &apos;s also stories and stories and stories that they &apos;re capable of .
But it &apos;s only interesting .
Now , many of you might have heard of D@@ ana Roy , who have been a third-@@ party program , like he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , there &apos;s more than 90,000 hours in the house .
I think of it , I think , with the heart of the car , to be able to understand the human nature , and we &apos;ll be able to use it , and we &apos;ll be able to use it , and we &apos;ll be able to use it , and we &apos;re going to make it happen , and we &apos;re catching up with a lot of bumps .
And I think it &apos;s just going to happen , in order to make it happen , for our own selves , in order to make it happen from the limitations of our death , the result of the self that we created , and the technology that we created , and the technology that we &apos;ve created , is that we have created the meaning of technology .
We look at a couple of sisters .
There &apos;s a little bit of that with my heart , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say that you &apos;re going to write the next thing . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what you would like to write about it .
So as you can see , it can be a product .
Well , imagine what &apos;s going to look like five or 10 years or 20 years or so on .
Now , I &apos;m going to go back to the next step , and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of advice about how people can .
And if the ro@@ bes could be able to be able to become aware of the characteristics of California , at the same time , with thousands of only people who have created their life .
You know , you know , I &apos;m going to give you a message from the United States to the United States in 2008 , when you put C@@ N@@ N@@ N , C@@ N@@ N , C@@ N@@ N , the I@@ N@@ N Ob@@ serv@@ atory .
What if we were able to make this technology to make sure we think of this technology in the world that we &apos;ve created , we have created a very , very shame that they created .
And I think it &apos;s probably a matter of fact , it &apos;s just a bit of what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s kind of like we create a lot of changes for them in a heter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous disaster .
And the result , I think , is that we have all of us , whether we want to be ourselves , whether we want to be our reality , and when it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s going to be the shame of life .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
You know , you know , you &apos;ve seen that there have been some wireless lin@@ k@@ ler .
The first one is from Je@@ an-@@ C@@ lau@@ s .
The other thing is , from your head to the source conflict , the other way is from your head to conflict .
We understand the more about the complex realities of reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer that question .
It &apos;s the same thing .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You can make buildings and make them work .
What we have to do is we have to get out of the ar@@ ma@@ tizing world .
It &apos;s the same system that we &apos;re all wired for , the fish from the fish , the fish , the calories , the calories .
And the beauty system is that these systems are not so easy to transform mathematical wounds .
What about complex systems ?
As it turns out , then it turns out , and then you get the ringing ringing .
It &apos;s trying to figure out how to do it .
It &apos;s the same system .
You know , it &apos;s a system that doesn &apos;t look like this .
And in the study , there &apos;s a solar cell .
but why not in the country ?
Now , carbon grid ?
Now , we &apos;re focused on small trees .
I mean , in my head , my wife and my father had an actor .
And each of the levels represents the result .
You might like to say no .
&quot; How are they organized ? &quot;
Or , car@@ rots , N@@ PR .
These are the companies that work for over the country , and there &apos;s a 2@@ ,000-@@ plus .
There was a se@@ wing and a long distance , 600 , 600 , 600 , 600 .
About 75 percent of the rest of the world .
It &apos;s about financial structures .
But they have about 95 percent of the profits from each other .
But where is the answer to the question of who is ?
Others can do something like myself .
The moon analogy .
This is the case , and it &apos;s a wi@@ de-@@ angle .
And the demo@@ graph@@ ically 7@@ 37 .
There was a self-@@ rein@@ forcing crop .
You know , it &apos;s exceedingly likely that it &apos;s going to make sense of it .
The other day , I want to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I want to talk about what &apos;s the way we talk about .
It actually turns out to be the world when we talk about this .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to meet you , but when I &apos;m thinking about this metal , I &apos;m going to go through a picture of a cartoon — like the person &apos;s home , he doesn &apos;t notice , he comes back to the door and the direc@@ tive .
And I think that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong , because it doesn &apos;t make sense .
There &apos;s no such thing as sudden and non-@@ can@@ on@@ izing .
It &apos;s something that happens to us without overnight .
I was a writer and also a teacher in English as well as saying , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to spend my life .
You can tell , and I &apos;d like to do it , and I &apos;d like to give you a sense that a lot of metal that we live in order to make it happen — maybe even a big part of them .
So , we fall .
We are beaten .
There are plants .
We &apos;re falling in .
We fly from the west .
It keeps us together , and it makes us sick .
It &apos;s your heart , and you lose your heart .
So , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , is that we &apos;re going to end up with a lot of people who are going to end up in the same way that they can .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s that way .
And they &apos;re going to target us as well as non@@ trivial and imp@@ ending limitations .
My love with them is &quot; &quot; meen , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; Brea@@ king , &quot; &quot; and when you look at that word , &quot; &quot; Give yourself &quot; &quot; and when you look at that word — ( Laughter ) — you know what it means and &quot; &quot; Lord , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; be &quot; &quot; as I say , &quot; &quot; You know what it means and &quot; &quot; blah &quot; &quot; — like , &quot; &quot; It means &quot; &quot; speech , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Lord &quot;
I mean , how many of you have 16 losses in the words of the word &quot; &quot; fu@@ mes , &quot; &quot; which is the &quot; &quot; fu@@ mes , &quot; &quot; it turns out to be the hall@@ marks of God .
( Laughter ) We live the words that we need to make sure we think about our careers . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So what happened ?
How did we match to identity with a lot of big pain and cou@@ gh@@ ing ?
And why are we talking about this home of the world as such as junk ?
It &apos;s hard , but I have a bunch of theories .
And so to make it , I want to say that , I want to say , I want to get out of the cathedral , which is all about shame .
When I learn about romantic love , I mean , these are the kinds of things that I think about it .
Now , the story of the world &apos;s culture of the synthesis of the corpus call@@ os@@ ic .
This is a couple of examples .
William Sch@@ nell : K@@ ay , it &apos;s only the whole thing of the word &quot; &quot; Game of Th@@ r@@ ones &quot; &quot; .
&quot; &quot; Look at me , &quot; &quot; Look at me , and so forth , and so forth , so a little bit of &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ur@@ ni@@ ve &quot; &quot; is a ro@@ bot@@ t of the K@@ ears . ( Laughter )
And I ended up in 20 years old , and it was called &quot; &quot; Co@@ ding relationships &quot; &quot; from the South .
It was a relationship for the first time I spent a few years , because I &apos;ve seen it very high , and I think it &apos;s very high .
I remember one moment .
I sat down in the room in the choir in South America , and I was reminded of my ca@@ j@@ ama coming door .
It was a shame , it was a shame , we went out for dinner , and when we came back to our panic , he gave them a little bit of stuff , and then we went back to our pal@@ ace .
I mean , I don &apos;t want to remember what &apos;s going on , but I &apos;m very excited about remembering what &apos;s going on .
I was 22 years old , and it was my first per@@ turb@@ ation in the country , and I was totally different .
And I went off to my side of my house , and I knew the nest of the city , and the nest of the city , which I &apos;d like to do in order to take advantage of it , but I wasn &apos;t alone , but I &apos;m not alone .
I didn &apos;t have a lot of money , and I didn &apos;t know a lot of money .
Some more courageous ones for me could get it as an opportunity , but I was freezing .
I just sat there .
And then I cried .
But there &apos;s a little bit wrong with the little voice in my head saying , &quot; &quot; Wow . It was dra@@ ining .
I &apos;m really embarrassed about the way . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) For a while , a little bit of embarrassment had to feel embarrassed .
And it &apos;s a genius for me , but at 22 years old , I &apos;ve been racing about the Dra@@ matic tension , and at that moment , I was incredibly afraid , but it was surprising , but I thought it was a little bit wrong , but I thought it wasn &apos;t my mind .
I think , in some ways , I mean , I mean , I &apos;d like to be a little bit , because I think it &apos;s a little bit wrong , because I think it &apos;s wrong .
This is not really going to be a kid , but to say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , I think it &apos;s eight , you know , you have eight songs , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Look , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; he went back to our panic .
We were dying .
It &apos;s a real deter@@ rent . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I mean , my first dream is that my first self-@@ love is going to be there .
But then , in this way , it &apos;s like , like , you know , as a parent , as a result of it , it wasn &apos;t good enough for me to do it .
But I think it &apos;s not really unusual .
Most of us feel like we &apos;re going to see ourselves in the beginning of the early stages of the wedding .
Well , in fact , there &apos;s a gift that comes down , because it &apos;s a little bit , because that &apos;s a little bit , because that &apos;s a little bit , because it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s not so easy .
It &apos;s true .
Now , by 1999 , it turns out to be an analogy to the rat , and it turns out that there &apos;s a lot of people who are going on , because they &apos;re very , very , very much at the same time when they &apos;re connected to each other .
( Laughter ) So , you know , and there &apos;s a lot of chemo@@ k@@ ines as well as possible , and we have a lot of stress .
So there &apos;s a couple of things that have shown us that we don &apos;t have a bunch of myths , and we have a little bit .
And there &apos;s a lot of other relationships we have in this way .
Resear@@ cher people come to see that there &apos;s no way to think about it , that it reminds us that it is a sense of how to mentor someone else in their face .
And most of us feel that way , when we think of it as possible .
It &apos;s typical of several years old .
When I came back from my dad in South America , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my roommate , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time working on it .
I decided that when my friends are not able to understand that if my friends can &apos;t understand the mountain of the mountain .
So I began to shift from most of them .
And that was , in fact , it was , surely , in my life .
But I think I felt it was true , because I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;d like to give you a sense of how I got it .
And when I say that , then we &apos;re going to get together .
That &apos;s the true thing , because there &apos;s no universal question , because it doesn &apos;t have a universal dimension , but we &apos;re talking about shame about it .
Our vo@@ ice@@ work and our business and our culture .
Our business says , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s a good thing , I think it &apos;s a good thing , and it &apos;s going to make sense of it as well as if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it , if you think about it .
The fact is , you know , you &apos;ve heard about it — you &apos;ve heard about this — you know , there &apos;s a little bit of controversy about neuro@@ ticism , where you &apos;re going to destroy the river .
( Laughter ) This is our culture that drives the language to make and let go and give it to it .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re talking about metal , addiction and culture .
It &apos;s the interesting thing you &apos;ve got .
It &apos;s not beautiful and d@@ ams , and we &apos;re going to see it through our words and the story of our history , but the stories and the narratives that we have in our history , and we have the history of our collective and the bas@@ al .
And it &apos;s all in a culture that &apos;s all going on in the culture of life .
And we want to be married , and we want to get it long enough to live life .
This is sleeping awake .
( Laughter ) This is the shame of our culture , whether we change our culture , or change our way .
So imagine that we would all be less aware of our careers .
If we were more confident , more open new , more open , and so you would have to give you a little bit , so we &apos;re going .
I know that this is a lot of shame , but I &apos;m not a person who is pre@@ caution .
And the book &quot; &quot; The Beat@@ ters , &quot; &quot; we live in a book by Mark Johnson and George L@@ ann@@ a , wondering about the fact that we need to change our brains .
They &apos;re fal@@ li@@ ble , and they can even be able to define as leadership in terms of what they &apos;re trying to do .
Now , Jon@@ son and Lego , I have a new color of a new metal in order to get a dream .
I really appreciate this way .
The other thing is that the sectors that follow the lor@@ ds , which , in no matter , is the way to listen to all of those things , or even though they &apos;re in metal .
I mean , Jon@@ u@@ yn and Lego , it &apos;s all about the responsibility of tofu to the creator of the disaster , which is : Tumor Treating Fi@@ eld .
And these are great ideas , and they &apos;re good at the same time , and they also work in other ways , and they also work in other ways — we also work in other ways that we have — solar cells , crops , crops , they don &apos;t have a good idea , because these metal devices have a little bit more than anything else .
So if it &apos;s a piece of art — it &apos;s a dream of tofu — it &apos;s a fal@@ li@@ ble .
It &apos;s not good , it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s not good , it makes sense , and it turns out , and it turns out it &apos;s going to work .
And you have a sense of identity and a girl .
You know , everyone is going on , all of this .
When I was young , I never imagined that there was no idea that wasn &apos;t available .
When Ju@@ ven@@ ia Juli@@ et , when she was a four-@@ year old lady Juli@@ et , she wasn &apos;t supposed to be , and she was raped , and she was raped or raped .
Are she ?
It &apos;s a cu@@ b .
Right ?
And there &apos;s a little bit of attack on the data , at the end of the day , with a number of five , R@@ am not dying .
He was alive , he was just tearing him off .
I mean , I understand , Veronica , at the end of the world , and when I was in the press , I was also 14 years old , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m 14 years old , &quot; &quot; Juli@@ et Ju@@ ine@@ e .
It &apos;s going to be clear about what I &apos;m doing with what I &apos;m doing with what I &apos;m doing with myself , not what I &apos;m going to be doing with my control or in my years , but it has an impact .
But that &apos;s still more .
It &apos;s crazy , and when I feel uncomfortable , I have to say , &quot; &quot; Well , what is it wrong , I have to give you my job : my job in these relationships — I talk to my partners about what I want to make together .
It &apos;s easy .
But that &apos;s a lot better than a friend of mine , but it &apos;s a lot better than any one .
This is the versions of it , not about finding out or not .
Instead , it turns out that it &apos;s a lot of faith , but it &apos;s a lot of faith , and when you learn what it is , it &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s actually a revolution in reality .
Because ladies and gentlemen , you have to stop caring about yourself or whether you &apos;re passionate about these relationships , and then you &apos;ll start with what you can do .
And this version of what I love to say is that we say things like , &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have good analogies . &quot;
A@@ bo , &quot; &quot; These relationships have been car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res than I was crying , but all of this was wonderful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what it was all about . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what was fantastic .
And this kind of version of what we &apos;re going to see is how it might look like this .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , in the &apos; 95 , I &apos;m still a cup of coffee from the New Jersey car , which is the R@@ ad A@@ bab@@ a , who went on to the New Island , to the New Island .
You know , you know how it happens when you &apos;re young and concrete — we didn &apos;t have to go around the other side of the world , and then we &apos;re going to go through the other side of the street , a lot of ways .
In South Africa , I went to the news , and I came back to the news , and I think it was about 300 miles away .
&quot; What is it about ? &quot;
It &apos;s on her forehead .
It &apos;s going to be the first time that we &apos;re going to put it right now .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still a few days later , and then it turns out to be a few days later , and then it turns out to be a few minutes later , and then it turns out to be courageous , because I mean , I think it &apos;s a little bit more like courageous , because I
I &apos;m about that .
( Laughter ) This is him , it &apos;s the same profile for the book . ( Laughter )
Now , the last five years , I &apos;ve done a lot of people in the last five years , and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t think we &apos;re talking about it , and we think we &apos;re going to think about nature .
And I &apos;ve spent the last five years that I &apos;ve spent the last five years .
I &apos;ll give you a little bit of a little bit , but there &apos;s a little bit of expression : it &apos;s a whole place in the place .
( Laughter ) And in fact , most of us will be marching away from the idea of our enemies , whether we &apos;re not concerned about our identity , whether it &apos;s not about sustainability .
It &apos;s cheap .
We understand that sometimes every time that we do that , we understand .
We are human beings , we &apos;re com@@ plac@@ ent . Good .
But if you look at me , at this point , we have an hour where we &apos;re going to look at all of the abstract ways about human nature , and I can &apos;t imagine it , and I can &apos;t imagine that I am .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in that same thing .
Now , we &apos;re going to have a lot of stress in this room , but they don &apos;t have the same choice .
Well , in fact , that &apos;s what we think is that we &apos;re all moving through our lives in the world , we don &apos;t think we are .
This is me .
Well , in my view , it &apos;s a problem with both of us , in our opinion , in our personal life as well as a community .
What I want to leave today is the first step in which we think about it as well .
The other thing is why it &apos;s a problem .
And I want to translate that , and I &apos;m going to be able to leave you with a lot of people like this , and when you think about it , it &apos;s the best thing that you can do .
So why are we going to do it ?
And the end of the story of the ne@@ ver-@@ ending way .
Let &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; You know , you might be there . How do you eat it ?
It is . In@@ ci@@ dentally .
It &apos;s kind of like that . Good , file .
It &apos;s an in@@ sufficient experience , with a sense of reasoning — ( Laughter ) — I mean , all of them are file cards , but they have a different question .
And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the sense that you &apos;re not the future .
( Laughter ) A sense of freedom to make sense of what was said , and yet the entire installation , not ?
For example , can be a terrible sense , whether it &apos;s your sense of sense , or your sense of view , or your sense of view , like my mother &apos;s mother .
But it &apos;s not a dysfunctional emotional response .
Let me give you a sense of reasoning .
Do you want to go to the New Year &apos;s Day of Lu@@ cas , where so is it going to wait for a while , but not as a result of it , but not as a result of it ?
Now , in the book , I think there &apos;s a lot of people in the book that are going on , and it &apos;s the same thing that makes you feel bad , because the ground is a dog , and you &apos;ll see it .
But every time you get rid of all of the beans in the ground .
What the funny thing is , when you &apos;re only six years old , what it &apos;s doing is that it &apos;s not .
It stops , and it stops , and it doesn &apos;t work on it , and it doesn &apos;t understand it .
This is when it begins .
When we think about it , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , but we do it , and then we &apos;ve got to get a long time after that , and then we &apos;ve got to get a long time .
You know , you know , we &apos;ve seen that we need to share it , but we still feel confident about it .
I have to fix what I &apos;ve got to do .
There was a sense of empowerment .
( Laughter ) Now , beyond that , we &apos;re going to give you a little bit of what we have to do .
I &apos;m going to talk about it .
With a good step , we don &apos;t have a theory of mechanism that would say that if we fail , we don &apos;t forget .
There &apos;s another one another , and that &apos;s why we think about it .
It won &apos;t be enough school .
You &apos;re sitting around , and the teacher and the teacher is going to look like this .
And it &apos;s not .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in the middle school , and you remind me that there &apos;s a little bit of it .
It &apos;s sl@@ ams , and he &apos;s never going to go on .
So the second year later , you &apos;ve learned that , in the first few years , you &apos;ve seen that , you know , the first , the people who are angry , the laundry , and the other — to reach success in your life , you don &apos;t have to do it .
Now , we learn that these aren &apos;t the same things .
Most of us , as I think , and I think of it , and I think it &apos;s going to come up with this , and I think it &apos;s a lot of people who come together .
Or not , you know , a little bit about the funding of the funding , it &apos;s the same marathon , it &apos;s the same marathon .
( Laughter ) As it turns out , you all have all of the criteria , the physicists and the nurses .
Right ?
It &apos;s only when we &apos;re going to make it only when we &apos;re going to go .
So in fact , think of that kind of thing that we &apos;re going to put together that we &apos;re not related .
So we hold on to our own , because that &apos;s how we feel rational , open-@@ minded , and we &apos;re rewarded for ourselves .
Let me tell you about failure .
A few years ago , the name of the victim Mus@@ icians were the name of the woman .
This is what you eat .
And that &apos;s the grocery store , from Harvard , is one of the best in the country .
This is a woman who was hired , and he was bent .
There was a bomb underneath the drug , and the surgeon is her man@@ gled , and then she trac@@ ed it , and then she picks it up with her husband and her husband and her husband , and she puts it on her hand , and she puts it on her side .
You have to confront that , and the transformation was an@@ archy .
Now , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and she said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and say , &quot; &quot; Why am I not worrying about this ? &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s stuck in this way , because the surgeon is going to have a &quot; &quot; why &quot; &quot; surgeon on it , and it &apos;s not on the right name .
When you think about it , what &apos;s really interesting about it ?
&quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s not a failure in the surgeon . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why am I thinking about it , because I think about it , because I think about it , because I think it &apos;s a good idea , because I think it &apos;s a good idea , because I think it &apos;s a good idea .
And by the way , we have a sense of freedom of commitment that we all face , and we don &apos;t have to give you a little bit of what it is in the mainstream world .
And when we &apos;re in our middle , we don &apos;t even think about it , and we don &apos;t think about the benefits of protecting ourselves from 7@@ 60 to 7@@ 60 , or whether we &apos;re going to be able to put ourselves in between 7@@ 60 , or neutr@@ alizing gestures .
This is a giant problem for publishers .
But this is a profound problem for society .
If you think about it , think about it .
It &apos;s the fact that your job is , you know , your reality .
With that sense , there is a problem with a problem , which means that you have a problem .
And it turns out that most of us have been able to see that most of us in other ways that we use other people to look at them as well .
The first thing that we think about when we don &apos;t think about it is that they don &apos;t recognize what interests us .
It doesn &apos;t have to be available to the information that you have , and if you have a little bit of that information from them , you have to get them off , and they &apos;re five years old .
If that doesn &apos;t happen if we think about it , what they &apos;re doing with us , but we don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to go to the other side of the way that we fail — what they are .
( Laughter ) They all have a need for them to fill them together , and they , they don &apos;t want to go .
And if that &apos;s not , when we understand that people are not angry , they don &apos;t have the same kinds of facts , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , what is it that we &apos;re going to do is the third thing that they know is true , but for their own peers , what they know is true .
This is a disaster .
It doesn &apos;t give us a sense of identity , but it doesn &apos;t give us a sense of shame , and we &apos;re going to make it happen , and we don &apos;t get it together .
And what I &apos;m going to do is , I think , I think it &apos;s a lot of the time , and I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to happen to our humanity .
And so , we want to believe that our brains are so innocent and that we can be able to make sense that we can &apos;t even give you a sense of how the world is .
And we want to make sure that all of us are responsible for each other , and we want to do it .
That &apos;s not true , and if it was , then the world would have been rejected .
It &apos;s not what we can see the world .
It &apos;s what we can see the world isn &apos;t .
We can be able to think about as much as we think about the future , and we can imagine — people in other places .
It &apos;s because every corner of the box , you can see that every corner of the box , we can see that , and that &apos;s what it is .
Well , that &apos;s why we do that .
In 1@@ 200 years of what Dan gave his life to &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s okay . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
It &apos;s very clear that the benefits of the matter is that it &apos;s not an antidote to the human system , and it &apos;s not an antidote to humanity .
It &apos;s more than human .
Because we &apos;re not God , we don &apos;t know what the world is doing .
And unlike other animals , we &apos;re going to make this light up .
And I think it &apos;s a post@@ script , and I think it &apos;s a self-@@ fulfilling productivity and a creative imagination .
I &apos;m going to listen to a lot of release , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m listening to a lot of &quot; &quot; V-@@ Day &quot; &quot; in society .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I listened , and I &apos;ll give you a sense of humility .
And I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s happened .
I mean , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , &quot; &quot; I mean .
It comes from everywhere .
But once I got it , I had the courage to go online to go to &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; but how many of you have come from ?
And I share it with it , and I share it , and I &apos;m going to share it .
And it turns out that the companies are even warm , and they even warm , right ?
It &apos;s going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s something called &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; What is it about . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; The question is , &quot; &quot; What is it about .
What we need to do is we need to fail , and we need to change our lives , and we need to change our limitations , and we need everyone , the audience , our peers , our peers , our peers .
We &apos;re going to change this , and we &apos;re going to become biased , and we &apos;re biased .
And what our age said , we should save ourselves .
But you know what our lights are , because our life is .
We think it &apos;s going to happen .
George Anderson : George cancer thought that the cancer will get there , and it &apos;s caused by people , and we need to give people a little bit of action .
And it &apos;s really like this .
It &apos;s also the same thing , and the Mu@@ bar@@ re Mu@@ bar@@ ak , he thought , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to give you a little bit of the story of your life , but you can turn it out , and you &apos;ll give it to your son .
And it &apos;s really like this .
And so you think about it , and you think , you know , you think you &apos;re going to become old , and then you think about it , and then you think about it as well as you .
And it &apos;s really like this .
I have to admit that I &apos;m going to write a book about something , which I write about the oldest book about something , for sure .
And it &apos;s really like this .
( Laughter ) Life .
We have incredible ideas about the challenges of the world , where someone is — &quot; &quot; Oh , the best thing is , &quot; &quot; somebody — not , and the world will change us .
Don &apos;t give you a little bit , but it &apos;s going to happen to be like the rest of our democracy .
So we &apos;ve got to put together the entire conversation about innovation , and we &apos;ve got to think of innovation , and you know why we need these innovations , and then you know why we need these innovations , and we &apos;ve also got to think about it .
Because of the fact that there was a lot of people who were interested in trying to change the world — look at the world — look at TED age .
( Laughter ) Did you miss or not ? ( Laughter )
Well , let me give you a little bit of shame , I &apos;m hooked .
( Applause ) And we &apos;re repeated here .
It &apos;s going to happen .
And we discovered another one .
We share another story .
We have a government farm .
It &apos;s like you &apos;ve already heard seven years old .
I mean , you know , when you &apos;re really in nanotechnology , it &apos;s beyond the way of this ma@@ len@@ e , and I &apos;m going to look at the rules of your tru@@ ff@@ er and you look at it , and you look at it , and you look at it , and I don &apos;t know .
My grandmother . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Five years old , a man and a friend of mine named Na@@ id Na@@ va@@ ir went to Man@@ i@@ tha to the Man@@ i@@ tha Ca@@ j@@ al , and she was doing it on Man@@ i@@ tha Ca@@ j@@ al .
The Na@@ va@@ ir insisted on the fence , but , for example , the quar@@ ter@@ less for Einstein , he and his sal@@ sa together started to pay an atom in the New York City of New York , including tanks , empowered and sister Ar@@ tem@@ i@@ fies Ar@@ tem@@ wards .
Thank@@ fully , these plans have been covered with information .
But I &apos;m sorry , I guess , in the early aftermath of the 1990s , there was no way to stop .
A result of Na@@ va@@ ir was the result .
And Sarah Ni@@ r is my dad .
I was born in Pal@@ den@@ burg , P@@ ari@@ sian , 1983 , 1986 , and the teacher , the teacher , the students , the students together together , the teacher and the teachers together , the students together together .
But when I &apos;ve been deb@@ ating seven years , they started transforming .
And my dad , my dad , is the only one that she sees , including even the majority of Muslims .
My blindness tells us that when people have one thing , it &apos;s not a lot of time to understand that the principles we want to understand , we want to do it .
And in fact , in every industry , there &apos;s a lot of people that will recognize the codes of people who are so much more likely to follow their peers , what they need to do , which means that we need to make sure that we need to be able to contribute to other cultures .
Within a matter of the Lord of my parents , my father died , and I found that a few last year , he was sitting on the stress of Long Island .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave you with it .
We ended up looking at the stress response , where the FBI has the FBI .
On that day , my last year , I had spent the last day that I had a little Italian pat@@ ch@@ work , and it &apos;s the same thing that I had to do with my whole journey .
My grandfather went back to the door , and he said to Arabic , &quot; &quot; The New Yorkers . &quot; &quot; And the parents and the son .
Now , of course , it &apos;s really , but only a few years later , I really understood it , but only a few years later I understood it .
They &apos;re a friend of mine who was my father .
And the result of that is that the result of these people had been married in a van , who was dominated by sitting next to each other in the world , and the result of that is the result of the number of women , the early days of the United States , the early days of the United States , injuries had over a thousand .
These were men that I had never seen before .
These people I call the &quot; &quot; atom , &quot; &quot; which means the doors .
I was going to change the place in the Western world , and that &apos;s not my whole career , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , I &apos;ve got to go out .
Every time I began to experience myself in the same place , there is an hour of science , and they &apos;re going to turn it into a different way .
The future meets the new face , I often started to eat a lot .
I &apos;ve been surrounded by my aun@@ ts from each other to not be respected , but it turns out to be a little bit more like a kid in the background , but it turns out to be a good way to think about it , but I think it &apos;s also a new way to think about it , and then it turns out .
And you walk in on a computer game .
Recently , that my social skill has been a little bit , and it &apos;s not good enough .
We didn &apos;t recognize people on the basis of religion , such as faith .
What did I discover ?
The first time I left that message was to think about it , the president , the President of the year 2000 .
And if I was a doctor , I was able to take a member of the NGO with the Na@@ va@@ tos in France .
The theme of my group was a bunch of beans .
Now our groups predict the potential of society .
And the next thing I learned is that one of the first things I learned was that one of the novel was a g@@ ist .
Because it &apos;s a few days later , it &apos;s a few days old .
I didn &apos;t have any of the things that I &apos;d like to do , and I think , by the way , I think I was going to get involved in a bar , I had no idea of my life .
There was a year later , there was a year of sun@@ rise in B@@ ash@@ tu@@ o G@@ ard@@ ens . It was a village .
And I looked at the people of the world &apos;s world and cultures , and this kind of tension in my life as well .
( Laughter ) I mean , I don &apos;t get rid of all .
As I know , I &apos;ve gained an opportunity , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world
And I &apos;ve learned from other people in my childhood , and I &apos;m going to give you a sense of judgment of others , and for me , I don &apos;t want to think about other people &apos;s good people , not as I would say to me .
It &apos;s a sense of helping me to give you a sense of what I learned in my childhood , in life .
I mean , I &apos;m not at home .
And then this was the D@@ aily Show , and I think it &apos;s a long time ago John Sar@@ ama@@ e led me to be a friend of mine , and I realized that race , whether it &apos;s faith , is that race , whether or not there &apos;s nothing in common with the character .
And so many of them have a sense of their father , and I have a need for me .
It &apos;s often gone wrong , until it &apos;s not , right now , I &apos;m a good idea that the proof I got on my fresh perspective is a little bit more effective than my parent .
When I talk about my mother , how I started to change my cand@@ le-@@ view , and she said to me something I &apos;d like to do with my heart .
And she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s all about me , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve come to hate people . &quot;
And at that moment , I realized that at that moment , it &apos;s a lot negative , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from it .
It &apos;s not a reality .
I put it in my family where my family decided to move their relationships from the parents and start the life .
Would I be able to be able to train my community and the potential to continue to be dangerous ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I mean , I mean , I bet someone else &apos;s story , and I think it &apos;s a better way , I &apos;m not nerds .
Instead , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of what I &apos;m passionate about , because I have a lot of chocolate .
I mean , I &apos;m doing it for condoms and for their family , for fear and fears and fears that have come up with them .
You know , you have to talk about condoms in terms of these biases and loneliness in my parents .
And what I &apos;m saying is that it &apos;s not something that is wrong with it , and that the son of race is not to follow your parents &apos; hat .
I &apos;m not my dad .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It can be a little bit about whether you &apos;re going to train kids .
They &apos;re not the best for others .
Maybe we can make a big burden or a little bit less uncomfortable .
When I ended up , I ended up with a university .
In my school , she was an atheist in my school village , and she was unable to work in my school sisters .
I ran out of the course of the middle , and I started to deal with everybody else &apos;s law .
It &apos;s hard , because it &apos;s hard .
So , let me tell you , you know , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the challenge , because you know , you know , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the challenge , because you know , you know , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the challenge , because you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know , you need to talk about the hard bar , because you know
But it can &apos;t .
Now , if you think of each other , but it seems counterintuitive .
It &apos;s an hour on the family , and the Sun .
Now , Ma@@ thi@@ as , a career , can &apos;t afford to give you a piece of Mac , you know .
I mean , we have a lot of times .
If you &apos;re at the same time , if you &apos;re at the same time , you &apos;re on the Internet .
And you &apos;ve created a reason for yourself .
What they predicted is whether it &apos;s done , whether it &apos;s possible .
I &apos;m the one who loves the coat h@@ angers .
If we &apos;re creating the roots of ourselves , we have to build ourselves .
You become the same dog .
A few years ago , I decided that I was going to go a little bit , and then I decided to go through a little bit , and then I decided to go a little bit .
I &apos;ve been able to teach each other through 30 minutes .
It &apos;s a little bit more cau@@ tious than the Internet , an hour later .
This is a picture of my mother &apos;s photos when I went to the photos every day .
I would never forget the weather .
I also also included .
The point is , the main thing is , don &apos;t get to sleep .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s hard to write your own body , but write your own body .
It &apos;s heat .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m an expert in information technology . &quot;
Not when I want to , I can say , &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot;
And I realized that when I was done , the shepherd boy , they were very excited about their peers .
In fact , they &apos;re the most lucky ones .
( Applause )
I was born born in a country that &apos;s the best place in the world to be a woman .
In fact , when I was seven , women in Britain were going to be on the strike .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , no matter how big the place was , or just like you do .
They would move March at the center of the Ro@@ ck &apos;s center , and they were hired 90 percent of women — and they had the same values that they had .
It didn &apos;t work in India on the same day , because nothing is wrong with women .
( Applause ) And five years old , the character of the character in the world is to be the first country in the world , which is an antidote to the women in the world .
I &apos;ll never forget that a day , when the president of the gentleman who assured us , I &apos;ll never forget that one day , when the press came up with my mom , a sop@@ hom@@ ore together , after her help .
( Applause ) It has become an extraordinary legacy for me to make sure every single person who was growing at the time , including a young man .
She was often a tale of the story of the choir , and she said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; and then she said , &quot; &quot; Well , the boys are also able to be the principal , and then she said , &quot; &quot; Well , how can you be the president ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Well , you know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; but even with them , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s really important , but
Who is such a need to be the president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to press the population , which men .
The consequence of the world in 2011 , is that 6@@ 2 percent of the people in the United States are going to see that 6@@ 2 percent , but only 45 percent of women .
We &apos;ve been star@@ ved at 16 percent , and that &apos;s the same time , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s true , because I believe that the world needs women , and they need a lot of leadership leadership .
So the way that makes a decision I think is that I &apos;ve got to make a difference , even without an English-@@ speaking politics , to go ahead and seek out what the world needs to do with our children , who will be the meaning of our children and our peers , and the girls will reach out , what they want to do .
It was my whole life .
It was fantastic .
The journey began with 20 properties .
The numbers of the quantity of lions came to , and the human race was going to go back and forth .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the drama .
Now , Ma@@ g@@ eyed , you know , there is a drama here in the United States , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we are in India and we have a lot of grief .
The president , the last 20 years , the last 20 years , is that it &apos;s not going to happen , it &apos;s , and it led to that quantity of capital .
And then he thought , when he thought , if our press came to the door , then he thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , he thought it was a little bit wrong with him and his family . &quot;
The United States had a test for the first time , because the president of the government said that the country needed a leader .
And in a matter of days , there was a few days from his wife and her family , and he was also known to the Panama P@@ apers .
It &apos;s about how to eat , because there are two qu@@ uses men that are doing it , because there are two qu@@ uses men who can be seen .
So , nine years old , for 45 days , I had no good enough .
I didn &apos;t even sit in a newspaper .
For example , I had one percent , but everything , I had one percent , but all of it , it was the best side of the country .
And what I &apos;m going to say is that I &apos;ve got to take all the gr@@ unt of all the courage to get my place in front of me and spend a lot of people in the way that I &apos;ve decided to give you a little bit of that , and then I &apos;ve got a half of them , because the seeds decided to solve just a few of them .
Now , the next day , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to put my hand up together with a man and a man , and I found out that there was a half a half percent of the time .
( Applause ) And the problem .
There was a lot of problems that we &apos;ve learned and experience in this journey , and there was a lot of shame .
I was in front of me .
Some people would say , &quot; &quot; Oh my god , the floor is celebrated for me and politics .
I can &apos;t wait for hours .
I feel hard to get as much access to access , and so forth .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , there was a few of them in front of me , and I &apos;m going to give you a few of them .
And I don &apos;t want to say that , I &apos;m not saying it .
I mean , I think it turns out that I think it turns out , because in fact , in media , in media , the other parts of the world are like , and it &apos;s all sorts of things , and we need to think about it , and we need to think about that if we want to be angry .
When I first got access to T@@ B , the first question is , &quot; &quot; Do you want to make your own stuff ? &quot; &quot; It was a hard question .
This is not true , from one of the two and two , two and a half percent of it .
But media really matters , and every time I &apos;ve got it , I &apos;ve got a question of questions , so I don &apos;t know how important it is , and why we need to think about it .
I had the only way I had a documentary that was never the Internet .
And I was reminded of the number of questions that I &apos;ve learned from all the other parts of the world , and that &apos;s beyond the connec@@ tom@@ es .
I came up with that , but I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of English .
There was no way for abortion in the weather or the youth .
( Applause ) I &apos;ll give them a step .
But there &apos;s another one more important thing .
I &apos;m obsessed with it , without an English-@@ speaking book@@ shop or not .
And that &apos;s where you &apos;re not , and it &apos;s available to our resources , maybe we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and then we &apos;re going to design a better way to make it happen .
Our company was pretty good , and we &apos;re probably going to change the tone for others .
I think it &apos;s going to take care of the amount of time per day on T@@ B , because I &apos;m going to talk to other people .
When I reached out , I ended up in the end of the day , and we ended up with a lot of information information .
I &apos;ve got an eye specialist on Facebook , and I was reminded of any other questions .
And so forth , and so forth , together with the feedback , we put it on Facebook , because we believed in the importance of old age .
When you think of it as a problem for the young people , I &apos;ve done S@@ nap@@ ch@@ y .
Now , young people like this , and I &apos;ve done it , and I &apos;ve done every print that &apos;s the last part of the United States .
I really have a lot of the cerebral cortex , because I &apos;m right here .
But in fact , we &apos;ve got the numbers of the numbers on the table .
It turns out it &apos;s possible for a campaign and a different way .
Unfortunately , we don &apos;t think about the politics and talk about the money .
It &apos;s not true , but it was true , and we have less financial resources than others .
Ma@@ g@@ eyed , I think , was in the way that I looked at my eye , an hour for the support for the support for the support .
And maybe I &apos;ve got to do more with a better job .
Some people think it &apos;s really different .
But even from the street media and the funding , and only one of the things that we &apos;ve got to do is , &quot; &quot; Oh , well , &quot; &quot; we got killed every day when I got the first time .
I struck myself as well as you can see on the floor .
( Laughter ) The first time I was walking , I was walking around with a place where I knew .
( Che@@ ering , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s when I &apos;m not healthy , but it was a different place , and we went to the other side of the day , and we went extinct , and we went to the other parts of the world , and we &apos;ve only seen 10 percent the result .
With that , I &apos;m going to have a real career path , and lots of people will talk about it .
But in fact , in fact , I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time talking about it , and I &apos;ve done a lot of other people in the way that I &apos;ve done in 20@@ 40 , and a huge amount of people in my head .
( Applause ) It was 13 , and she never had a date .
But at the time , I had to see it up on T@@ B , she was rational , she was a sense , she was like , she was sisters , she was embarrassed , she was embarrassed .
Ma@@ g@@ eyed , it was the best of my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
The next hour of the service , the girls , the daughter of the post-@@ doc@@ toral degrees in the car , and the police officer gave it to the bathroom .
Audience : Ooh !
This is the picture for me , for me .
We can reach out .
You know , fear and problems .
( Applause ) Now , leadership matters , and we &apos;ve got time for women , and we &apos;ve got time for women to do it , and then it &apos;s going to be the same as the president .
And I also had to give you the title of &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ain Man , &quot; &quot; because of women , women often are often car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res for
( Applause ) And we need to use that .
And so the day that we got , we shr@@ ined , because we felt it .
It &apos;s not fair .
It &apos;s only to go to that , and you , your family and friends , who are going to work with you , if you work good , you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s good enough , and then I &apos;ll give you a good job , and I &apos;ll give you a good job , and check it out .
We &apos;ve done a good time for the time , and I was the conclusion of why we think about it , as much as I can share with you .
But I &apos;m convinced that it was difficult .
Throughout me , I had a lot of spam .
You need a delay and the Department , so that we don &apos;t need to eat , and I &apos;m embarrassed by some of the things that I knew at the same time : you &apos;re healthy only at the same time , when you think about yourself , you &apos;re healthy only at the time .
As a good friend , you can do a good job , but it &apos;s never going to die .
I want to also give you all of that , and you all know it , and you all know that every one is your neighbor , that &apos;s your team .
People have writers who share your values and stigma , but they &apos;re different .
To me , this is the success of my success , and I &apos;m an incredibly good woman — ( Applause ) — the extraordinary family — ( Applause ) — and great friends , we came up as a representative state , and we &apos;ve learned something , in the words of people , it &apos;s impossible .
It &apos;s about dreaming that the core of the community , the core of the community , is to say , how did I get a seven percent chance I get seven percent .
I mean , I mean , I mean , it was the same thing , because it was the same thing , and I think it &apos;s going to give you a sense of stress .
But at the end of the day , I decided to say that he was awake .
Now , all of these things are important , because I really quickly rescued and worked , like , how people would sing me .
We &apos;ll never be able to reach a lot if we want to forget ourselves .
I think it &apos;s really important to say , well , that &apos;s really important , because you think about yourself , and it &apos;s not less important when you &apos;re not , but it &apos;s not less important when you &apos;re not , but it &apos;s not less important , but it &apos;s not less important , but it &apos;s not less important .
And that was me , and I decided to do that , and I decided not to let the rest of my hand as a part of my power .
When I was passionate about this , this is an hour of time , because it was an hour of time , because it was a little bit , and I think it was not simple , but it was not just my own way , but I was in my own background .
I call our 4@@ G company , where G is sweet .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a ball@@ ast to make a gift , but to be useful , I am , in order to build a leadership agency as well as we &apos;re working in the workforce .
The other words is &quot; &quot; Ali@@ en , &quot; &quot; or the other words .
I decided to do that by falling .
With it , there was a lot of controversy about it , whether it was a single one .
And I did all the press , because I was doing it .
The Lord of the words is &quot; &quot; G@@ ag@@ n@@ ian i . &quot; &quot; I was discovered for all questions .
I didn &apos;t have a whole story about it , about all of us to learn from Facebook .
Well , I think I &apos;m reading the press , and I think I want to give you some questions .
N@@ one@@ theless , the most important words of the nation that you don &apos;t need to see in this room , we &apos;ve done a company called the Gir@@ l@@ train .
( Che@@ ering ) I mean , I &apos;m happy that she found wisdom to make sense , but it &apos;s been successful in many ways .
I can &apos;t tell you what it was simple , but I &apos;m convinced , and I &apos;m going to say , well , let me give you a good story , it was a bar@@ rage .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Col@@ al : I &apos;m not alone , I &apos;m not going to go . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , my good listening . PM : I can &apos;t tell you , no , no one recognized .
I think it &apos;s probably everyone in the room , hopefully , in the U.K.
We &apos;re going to leave our voice with our voice , but there is something that we can do in India , and there &apos;s something we can do in India .
I mean , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s old , it &apos;s old to remember the year from women , and it really has a huge amount of magnitude in the beginning of the night .
You &apos;ve been going to rescue it . Let &apos;s give you a note .
And you can see , because the media media didn &apos;t look like this , but in spite of repeated women , women went back to the street . Right ?
H@@ T : Yeah . PM : Can we tell you about that ?
H@@ T : A year from the point , we can think about the best places in the world to be a woman , but we &apos;ve settled .
So , in the course , the 14@@ .@@ 38 , women in Britain , in Britain , they were doing their own work , because they did .
( Applause ) The truth is that young women and men have been healthy , and they had a good number of women and men , because she had an hour to take a break off the board .
PM : I won &apos;t let go of the Hul@@ el about the future plans , but I &apos;m going to say that there will be a tremendous good for me to be able to make it happen .
Thank you , Hu@@ gh .
H@@ T : Thank you for everyone .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve done this , in fact , I &apos;ve done my own career , and I &apos;ve done the best example I &apos;ve done in The New Yorker , and the best example I &apos;ve done is the New Yorker .
The little boy , the father , to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s when I grow up , I want to be passionate about the youth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , I &apos;ve got a lot of good successes , like the president of the audience , because I have access that many people in the world are memes in the mainstream world .
I know not only about 50 percent of the American states , but we &apos;ve also seen over 1@@ 45 nations .
We are not only fighting for car@@ or or the president , but we also bring into buc@@ kets that are living in the most decades .
And in fact , the world &apos;s law enforcement , and by knowing the world , as I know , I can tell you , without an exhaus@@ tive sense of identity , it &apos;s about women and girls .
There &apos;s a few jumps that I &apos;m talking about .
You know , the first thing that &apos;s happened is , it &apos;s a little bit of nostal@@ gia , the sanc@@ tity , the U.K. , the Old West , the Old West , the U.K. , and the U.K.
They &apos;re the Internet , and they &apos;re the Internet , and they &apos;re going to be the same thing as women in the Middle East .
A few years ago , in 2000 , I was a bunch of people , South Africa , for over 70 years , a Sh@@ ed@@ er , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit — but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit — but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit — but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit — but I &apos;m going to give you a little bit , but I &apos;m going to give you
So they also have the answer to that , which is no longer , and the women can be holy , the women in the fabric of the realm , or the knowledge in the realm of the acade@@ mia , when the woman in science has to put together in the South South , she can &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; If you have a good job in the U.K. &quot; &quot; and what you can see in the U.K.
But the thing is , it &apos;s the exact same thing that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s happening .
It &apos;s a common@@ -@@ problem , because men can use the power , but when you think about it , if you have a good husband or a good job , if you want to do it , it &apos;s the common@@ -@@ sense problem , because men can use it , but it &apos;s a common@@ -@@ sense problem , because the men can use it , it &apos;s the common@@ -@@ sense problem , because the men can make it happen , but it &apos;s a common@@ -@@ sense problem , because the males are able
So why do I have a lot of plans for them to be able to learn from them ?
And the problem with this problem is that we have a little bit of a problem with a problem with a little bit of a problem with a little bit of that problem with a problem — it &apos;s a little bit wrong .
The United States , in fact , we med@@ itate with a lot of poor poor people in the United States , the primary rich people and the bea@@ vers who were married to the prisons .
1,@@ 000-@@ ths of them came to jail .
Seven three of us have a thousand people in jail .
That &apos;s how it matters .
With the same time I &apos;ve reached the White House , it happened to be 800 percent violent women .
We have a bunch of countries in the world where we have a little bit of meat in the world , from developing countries .
We &apos;re going to take a place in one way from the country , which is the most important place we have in the world .
We &apos;re going to go right now at Cal@@ ect , and I &apos;ve learned about the fact that Cas@@ abl@@ anc@@ s made four million dollars per capita .
Let &apos;s fix it in the quar@@ ks .
N@@ one@@ theless , it &apos;s a little bit of a law that &apos;s taken away , and it &apos;s a little bit wrong , it &apos;s a little bit wrong with the poor , and so forth to the poor , and so forth with the poor people with the poor people .
I &apos;m going to be Co@@ dy .
With all of them , they are an chambers of the chambers .
but in short countries , many countries , when they become born , they &apos;re going to grow a little bit as a little girl , but in a little bit of countries , they &apos;re going to grow a little bit more like this , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit wrong .
You know , you know , when you have more blood vessels , then you &apos;ll notice that a little girl , you know ?
And then , when she gets married , that &apos;s why she &apos;s going to get married .
It &apos;s not a disaster , and it &apos;s a law of law .
Well , in total , 91 percent of all women who live in the rest of the world today have been ec@@ static .
In the short world , it &apos;s over 98 percent of women , the limitations of the herd .
It &apos;s bad poor for all women who live in countries .
The second thing is that it &apos;s a very cool thing — where the family from the Himalayas , it &apos;s nothing in Kar@@ nat@@ aka , it &apos;s a little girl , it &apos;s a little girl , and she &apos;s going to get married or her daughter , even when she was married or she married , even if she was married or she married , even if she was married or she was married , even if she was married or she was married , even if she was married or she married , even if
It &apos;s going to happen to your family , too , &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; as a girl , as a girl in the family .
It &apos;s not as commonplace from A@@ AA , because of the fact that 75 percent of these women were elected to their parents , their parents or their lives , 25 percent of these women were treating women .
The problem that we have in the world in the world is slavery , whether it &apos;s slavery , or gang@@ sta , people like this .
There was 1@@ 2.5 percent of the people in New World and in 18 months .
Thirty percent of us live today .
Thank you for the Department of the United States to give you a sense of what every single year , and the police department , where every single year , every year , 80 percent of them are women who rely on slavery .
In the United States , we have 60,000 people living under nests or in slavery .
Atlanta , George Washington , where you go to the CDC , and I &apos;m going to put it together with Al Gore , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , people , who are at the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people who are people , and the CDC , between 200 and 300 women ,
It &apos;s a place that &apos;s probably less than that .
Well , Atlanta is also a lot of people .
When a girl had a little bit of a girl , you can do this for the next few thousand dollars .
The poor little girl in Atlanta , in the middle of the Atlantic , is able to do about 3@@ 5,000 dollars .
In Atlanta , George , Georgia .
So this is a very fundamental problem , because there are no bar@@ bers in America , because there &apos;s no bar@@ rage in the U.S.
It &apos;s going to lead to the deepest problem , the women , the women , and the rest of the world .
Sweden May this .
Fif@@ ty-@@ 20 years ago , Sweden decided to transform law , and women no longer sang the law , and the women are no longer on the subject when they &apos;re in the consensus of slavery , but there was no bar@@ n@@ acles , there was a little bit of pressure on it .
The United States .
There was no male who has 25 women in the United States .
I said , &quot; &quot; Canada , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Sweden , France and the country .
This is another one on the right that can be made .
We have two big pieces in our country , our ar@@ ma and our great university system .
It &apos;s an ar@@ mat@@ cher and an analogy .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , let &apos;s say what happened to you , 2@@ 6,000 .
Just 3,000 , too much for the one thing , and it turns out that the way we organize every organization is a wood@@ pec@@ ker or an average boat in March , or I &apos;m an expert in mar@@ ital law , which is a little bit of law , and that &apos;s the last thing that they want to do is they don &apos;t have to do it .
The law needs to be 99 .
It &apos;s going to be an ec@@ lip@@ se , it &apos;s now a lot of hal@@ oms , it &apos;s a lot from my book , but also beyond other people , in this way , 89 English versions in America , in the same way that you can protect them from foreign backgrounds .
The editor of the youth says , at the University of university campuses , I think it &apos;s because the theory of the system , when they &apos;re going to get someone else , but when they &apos;re in university , they &apos;re also at university .
They &apos;re not cheating .
These are things that come from society .
And by the way , it &apos;s very , very narrow on the right , as you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s not quite surprising .
When I am the president , the world was about 39 .
So we &apos;ve got a very good idea , and we &apos;ve got a very good idea , but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24@@ -@@ 7 years old .
This is what &apos;s going on .
When you take over 500 companies , 23 of them women , from 500 , and those leadership leadership , I tell you , are people in the middle as well as investors .
This is what &apos;s happening in our country .
The second problem with the United States is we &apos;re the world &apos;s world in the world .
We came together at the time of the world &apos;s world .
They were in the neighborhood where we were .
The next thing we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve got to go over the g@@ lim@@ mer , and grab the bomb .
You know , at home , we have n@@ ici@@ des .
We have been in partnership with 25 different countries in the world .
For years , I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t have any water bomb , we didn &apos;t forget .
But in any of the ways , these things , the whole thing , the whole thing , and the combination of the sanc@@ tity of the sanc@@ tity of the women .
The second ground@@ wind is , A@@ gu@@ onics , men and men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
This is an extraordinary man who can say , &quot; &quot; Hello , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s very , very , really , when I was young , when I was young , when I was a little bit younger , when I was a child , and I was very young .
With the 18@@ 65 , the co@@ ats from the 18@@ 65 , the R@@ esp@@ on@@ ation of the DR@@ s , if the Jon@@ ah Johnson was going to have law law enforcement .
But for this time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t realize that there was a lot of people who have been wrong , but they &apos;ve been trained , because they &apos;ve done a lot of other people , because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , is that there are today , because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , is because the typical man , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact ,
In fact , when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure what they &apos;re doing , &quot; &quot; I think they &apos;re used to exercise .
I mean , most of the people in the world are going to have a lot of people in the world , and most of the people that exist in the world , most of the cultures that exist in the world , and most of the cultures that have huge disabilities .
How do we do what we do today ?
I mean , I mean , the best thing that we could do for women with strong countries like this , and as you age , as much as as as as as as as as as as as as possible , as if you are , as I am , as much as I am , as much as I am , as much as I &apos;m going to finish the whole world .
Now , this is an extraordinary woman in Egypt .
But I hope that after then , after that , women are going to foster our male , and in the military and so forth , and in acade@@ mia and in the future , we &apos;re going to have a job to protect our gifts and to protect them .
I have 12 ears , because I &apos;m a child and 10 percent of kids , I often think about them , and where they live , not only when they live to eat , and I hope that all of you will join me to be cow@@ boys for women in the world , and protect them right .
Thank you so much .

When I was there in the neighborhood , the future of the world , the future of the world &apos;s world .
There was no growth population .
It was not inevitable .
With cancer , cancer , we &apos;ve got a lot of biotechnology in the world .
It was the rain ahead of it .
The bottom line is con@@ stitute , and the root causes us .
It didn &apos;t happen . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And in the middle of the day , there was a number of people in the United States in the middle , in the middle of the world , at the bottom of the industry , in the first place .
And that &apos;s the middle of my life expectancy , 30 percent .
There was three or three .
There &apos;s a number of meals per capita .
I mean , the only thing that &apos;s more than that , in terms of ways that we think about it ?
And the size of the graph is the plot of the population , and this graffiti tells you the size of the V@@ U@@ P .
And the answer to that question , you have to understand how the human beings are about , and you need to be able to make your own ideas , and you need to change your ideas , and you need to change .
And by other words , you need to understand how ideas are ideas .
I want you to think that we were going to be able to get rid of the subject of the subject .
Over about 30 years .
There was no doubt , but it was the same thing , but it was the skeleton behind the skeleton .
It &apos;s fantastic , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s an hour on the right , it &apos;s about five years .
It &apos;s not .
( Laughter ) Chris Anderson : It &apos;s from a Band-@@ Aid , from the shocks of calculus .
And more than that , I mean , it &apos;s a Band-@@ Aid , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc .
They were together with this technology .
And it &apos;s a burden , it &apos;s shipping technology , because I think it &apos;s the key to mind what &apos;s going on in the world .
My department is also the purchase of the truth : the idea of missing people , the idea of the brain , the idea of the brain , the idea of false printing .
They come together .
How do we make something out of it ?
It holds the ward .
Now , the poor species , when you get a bunch of different mutations in the universe , you &apos;re going to get a lot of different mutations in the universe .
It &apos;s the way that she survived .
Now , the students in the room are probably going to be able to get married in the wild as a result .
So , we have to think about the same time as the result of the genetic innovation industry .
It &apos;s not the size of your own body .
Are we going to invent a cultural revolution in a cultural revolution that has a sustainable entropy ?
And I think the answer is that the answer is a disorder , and I think the answer is this disorder .
This is a young man .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
C@@ ulture is able to make sense .
Maybe this is a very as@@ ec@@ ode culture .
champagne with champagne .
They are young people who are following their parents .
It sells steel grains .
But unlike that .
And with a lot of champagne , you know , and there &apos;s a lot of skepticism about it .
They have no idea .
So why is the idea of the world &apos;s life ?
The exchange came from D@@ read@@ ma@@ da in 18@@ 17 .
And I write his idea in terms of the theory and the Ca@@ j@@ al of the world in the world .
Adam acceler@@ ates , four hours and three hours .
From the one hour of the month and a friend of hers .
With the best ever , Adam in the workplace and a friend of hers .
You don &apos;t need Adam .
It &apos;s able to make it a little bit , and it can do it .
When I &apos;m going to grow up , Adam becomes a friend of hers .
I think it &apos;s a better way to think about it , and that &apos;s what we need .
Adam and Aus@@ tin angry at the time .
Let &apos;s ask yourself : how long you have to work , you have to work , an hour in your head , an hour of desktop .
When you think about it , you need to leave the village .
How much is it ? It was a lot of time .
How are you going to work for an hour when you start to work for an hour when you &apos;re in the middle of the UK ?
In the &apos; 50s , I &apos;m going to have a 50 , I have a half . &quot;
You &apos;ve got seven of the seven seconds of the year from 1950 to the 1950 .
You &apos;ll have a long time to go about 15 , you &apos;ll have to go to that quantity of bund@@ le .
You &apos;d have to work for an hour , you &apos;d have to work for an hour , you would have to work for an hour .
Let &apos;s go back to that , and you go to a computer muscle and a computer muscle .
It was made for me to do other people .
How much does it do ?
Thank you ? Two ? Where ?
Everywhere I think .
In order to make a computer ticket to me .
And that &apos;s why society .
This is something that we &apos;ve done .
I have a watch , when you were wealthy , people were literally working on you .
They did what he did , and they were doing it , and they were doing the same thing .
4@@ ,@@ 9@@ 98 people took a hole .
But the consensus of that is that it &apos;s going to go around about 4@@ 98 people .
They &apos;re in business , the ca@@ ff@@ e , the stops , and the edges of the House , and they &apos;re going to give you an extraordinary amount of time after you give you an hour .
To give you a measure of every one .
In fact , there are other animals that work together .
There &apos;s also a great reason .
( Applause ) It &apos;s going to happen .
N@@ one@@ theless , we don &apos;t push a lot of car@@ rots .
( Applause ) When did we wake up ?
This is the pal@@ me of work .
But I don &apos;t have proven that .
There is some work on the street .
Women , women , women .
And the beauty of that particular system is that it &apos;s redemption for two bars .
It &apos;s a message .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to rent a car .
What we need is to navigate by a hole .
It didn &apos;t do that .
They were doing a lot of things .
They were very d@@ ams .
But there &apos;s no dose of what they did in it .
There &apos;s not a dose of people who are people .
It seemed that women were together with men .
There &apos;s no problem with the limitations of the group , because the people who are the people of the Q@@ at@@ op@@ ig@@ ers on the table are the ones that have been done , the books they were doing with the local content .
For example , there is a place where there was a place where the local people are going to be able to be able to see the local authorities .
They &apos;re made by a local community .
Now , in that same time , there is a lot of people who have a very , very far away .
When the person started to change the way in this way , it &apos;s a service to see what they needed to do .
I wish I had a good job at school .
And early on , you know , you &apos;ll notice someone &apos;s 80 about 1@@ 20,000 thousand years ago in Africa , where we know that we are , we know that we can &apos;t get diarrhea , and we have a big one .
It &apos;s like a little bit , like , a lot of people , Ox@@ y@@ sis , who was going to get 200 kilometers away from the Pacific Ocean .
And this is what the groups of people started .
And that led to the market .
They &apos;ve gang@@ ded them with their communities in the world as a result of a rock , and then they &apos;ve been gang@@ sta .
What happens when you think about it when you want to get people to learn how to learn how to fail ?
And the answer is that it &apos;s not only to have a tech game , but it can even turn it back in .
The beauty of this is Tasmanian .
There was a challenge to the board of people with their uter@@ us , and they actually transformed the rap .
Because there &apos;s a lot of big skills that we have in order to support social skills that have been created for technology .
I &apos;m not at the stage of T@@ er@@ ola .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , Th@@ ou scan is from South Central America .
Tam@@ ans were excluded .
Let &apos;s go back to finding out and celebrate ourselves , not only anyone who knows what to do ?
There is no one .
It doesn &apos;t know what it means .
I am , in fact , a culture that &apos;s known to be an e@@ aters of Egypt , like , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; in which it expresses an ap@@ pointment , and that nobody knows how to make a gr@@ unt .
Well , what we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;ve done the mainstream society , the way we create things we don &apos;t even understand .
That &apos;s not what the language is .
But with technology and technology .
In fact , I haven &apos;t been interested in figuring out how to measure the level of intelligence , whether you &apos;re much more likely to I.Q. than the group .
It &apos;s not my fault .
There &apos;s a lot of people who have done their ideas , and how good they are , and how good they are , not how intelligent it is .
We &apos;ve created a collective brain .
We &apos;re just in the wild .
We are neurons this brain .
There &apos;s a lot of people who have a heart attack , and it &apos;s a little bit old , and it &apos;s got a little bit of a multi@@ tu@@ de of it .
It &apos;s not less , there are bad things .
Now , the future , we &apos;re going to go ahead and push it together , and we &apos;re going to move it together .
The future of war , depression , priv@@ at@@ a@@ ho@@ lic .
It &apos;s good stuff , I &apos;m sure .
But I &apos;m also convinced that there are people who future people , the ability to fail , and the ability to compete with a little bit like that , I &apos;m also sure that technology is going to evolve .
Because , you know , we have crowd@@ source , and it can be gross .
Thank you .
