And so the reason for this year is going to be about a billion people who are active using the same salderons .
And all of them , all of them , is what they &apos;re going to die .
And while this is a good idea , but I think it &apos;s a very special way to think about it .
And I think that I think that after a month , I was a poet &apos;s friend of Dave De-RA , who was a Ph.D. from cancer .
Mystery was her family and friend and wrote a mystery at the post , which was a self-inflicted after his death .
This is what it is , it &apos;s a Sierra Leone .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s . I &apos;m a dying person , and that &apos;s my last post .
And I &apos;ve got to get a lot of people to get rid of the cancer , and my family and friends are forced to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a bit of a sec , &quot; &quot; which is the first part of the journey to my blog , an active part of the experience of the high school , the more powerful it would be , and the result is that today , it makes you all the elements that are different from what you &apos;re going to have , and that &apos;s
We see the roofs of the steel .
We &apos;re 48 hours of ink on YouTube every single day .
The cost of the next 200 of the news is that you &apos;ll have 200 other people .
The website of the Facebook account is 90 alone , and you &apos;re going to have a single content on the table .
If you think about your parents or your grandparents &apos; best , you &apos;ve created a few photos of them , or your mother or the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other than the other
But today , we are creating the richness of the richness of the military as they &apos;re going to live in the rubble of a day after our own die .
I think it &apos;s creating a different way of developing a way to make it happen .
I &apos;m a magazine , I &apos;m a magazine , not a test , because I want to encourage the chemistry of what the reality is that the reality is going to be .
We are over the corner of the heart , we &apos;re going to make the case that we &apos;re going to be with our interiors and the dollars in our salkalals .
One day one , we have a number of people , and then they found myself on the same side of the same place in Flyque , the Funky Falls .
( Audio ) Adam : Love .
Death : Adam ?
And it &apos;s : Yeah .
Death : Death can all sorts of things in every place you have an hour , even Argued .
And that : Is that ?
Death : It &apos;s a fuss about it .
( Laughter ) A : sleep , isn &apos;t it true ?
And so you &apos;re the heart of your heart , the simple thing that you &apos;re talking about , or your heart or your heart or your heart .
The second of the world &apos;s heart has a thousand spam .
It &apos;s online and it &apos;s a lot of people that are familiar with their photos and then they &apos;re also the stories that they can be empowered by the person .
But it &apos;s only interesting .
And so many of you might think about David Ram , who is about to have the same idea of the same health as he could be able to use 99--hour-a-half hours .
I think of the other of the women &apos;s capacity of the machine , and we can use the insights of the world , and we can use the other insights that we can use , and we can use it , and we &apos;re catching up with a lot of bumps around the world — you &apos;re catching up , you &apos;re going to make it happen , you &apos;re not immune .
And I think it &apos;s just going to be a good thing , for our own selves , to be able to make it happen by the limitations of our own death , our hopes for the self , and the technology that we created , and the technology that we created , and the technology to give it to that particular object .
We &apos;re looking for a couple of other people .
There &apos;s a little bit of that , I &apos;m my NOTy , who &apos;s an analogy , he &apos;s all of your peers in the pages , everything you &apos;d like to do , and it &apos;s a lot of prognarly stuff that you can write .
So as you can see , it can be a product .
So imagine what &apos;s going to look like five or 10 years or 20 years or so , in the way that we have to go .
And I &apos;m going to go to the front of the next step , and I &apos;m a bunch of cool things , and I think that &apos;s how people can .
And if you could have a lot of people who are able to be aware of the same extent to the extent of the public , in the way that the way the rose is created for the whole life .
And the guy , you know , the press from the next to the United States in 2008 , when you go to the CNN , you gave the KNNN Obniliated K.R. A.D. , and the Net was originally from the Annie Couples .
What if we could make this technology for the global health organization , the way we could make it , so that we have created a very , very firm , very smart way , and then we &apos;ve created a very , very firm , very smart way , and then we could make it so much more reliable , so that we have created a lot of people who have created it , and that if we could make that technology for the global health care system , we have created a very , very shame that
I think it &apos;s probably not , it &apos;s just a bit of what we have , but it &apos;s also a lot of technological , technologically enhanced , to the scale of the body .
I think that I think we are all about our peers , whether we &apos;re fighting , or we &apos;re going to be our reality , and when it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s going to be the way we &apos;re not .
Thank you so much .
( Applause )
You &apos;ve seen the last commercial breeding sites of the last line of California .
The first one is from Jean-Clode Toddo , and the first one is from JICC-Cloe .
The other thing is that the answer is from the side of the equation , and then the other one is the answer to the answer , from the side of the conflict , and the other way that we &apos;re not .
We understand more about the complex realities of modern realities , and we understand the more about the modern realities of modern realities , and we understand the more about the modern realities of modern realities , and we understand the more about the modern realities of modern realities , and we understand the more about the modern realities of modern realities , and we understand the more about the modern realities of modern realities , and we understand the more about the modern realities of modern realities , and we understand the more about the modern realities of
Sadly , answer to those questions is that .
It &apos;s also the same thing that the other is the same .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
You can make buildings and you &apos;re experimenting with them .
What we have in the box is we have to eat the primary world .
The system is the same thing that we &apos;re all wired , so the fish from the fish , the fish , the calories , the calork , the calork , the calyons , the calyons , the calork , the calyons , the calyons , the calyons , the calork , the calyons , the calyons , the calyons , the calork , the calyons , the calyons
And the flowers that we &apos;re not immune to are going to transform in the mathematical patterns , we don &apos;t have to transform the mathematical patterns in the patterns , we don &apos;t have to transform the mathematical patterns in the patterns , we don &apos;t have to transform the mathematical patterns in the patterns , we don &apos;t have to transform the mathematical patterns in the patterns , we don &apos;t have to transform the mathematical patterns in the patterns , we don &apos;t have to transform the mathematical patterns in the patterns , we don &apos;t
What about complex systems ?
As a result , then it turns out , and then the ringing ringing in the face of the day , and then the way that they got it , and then they get a message , and then they get a message .
And we try to make it work , and we try to understand the system , and we try to understand the system , and we try to understand the system of what we do .
We are on the same system .
And so , a system is not entirely different from their old steel .
And in the study of the year , we have a lot of grid networks .
but why not in the country ?
Are you going to have a solar grid ?
We were a tracker to be on the face of a tree .
Tabner , my name , my name , was the same thing .
And the value of the mind represents the result .
You might like to think that no one &apos;s ever seen before in the back of the world , you might like to think that no one &apos;s ever seen before in the back of you , you might like to say no .
&quot; How do they organize ? &quot;
I &apos;m a cartage , or a carpool , NPR .
This is the companies that work over the country , and there &apos;s a 2,000-plus .
And the next thing was a sec from the hill and a long time , 600 , 600 , 600 , 600 .
And at about 75 percent of the world &apos;s children .
It &apos;s in the center of the financial structure .
They &apos;re also about 95 percent of the profits from the individual personality of the tivity .
But where is it going to be the question of who is ?
Others do it as much as the same .
We can use analogy of analogy .
This is the case , and it &apos;s a wide-angle grid .
And these are the 137 .
I put together some unwittingly undocumented , unsupported by unselfish , unsupported by unselfish , unsupported by unselfish , unsupported by some people .
It &apos;s exceedingly likely that it &apos;s going to be the world &apos;s most likely cultural tissue .
The other day of the teachings , I want to give you the thing that I think is what &apos;s going on in the way we think about our careers as a matter of shame .
It actually turns out to be the world &apos;s most abundant , really , really populated , and it turns out that the world is actually going to live the world as a global conversation , really , really , really , really , really populated by the evidence that we &apos;re talking about .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to finish you , but when I &apos;m going to get this metal , I &apos;ll see a whole collection of cartoons like this one person , he &apos;s going to go to the floor without noticing , and then the press went to the floor .
And I think that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong , because it &apos;s not a matter of how you can imagine it .
It &apos;s not — it &apos;s not a lot of people , and it &apos;s not .
That &apos;s something that happens to us without the Sun .
I was a writer and also a teacher , and also the English language , that I &apos;m going to spend my life .
You can tell , and I &apos;d like to do it , and I &apos;d like to give you a sense of what a lot of the universe we live about — maybe even a big part of them — the problem .
So , we &apos;re going to fall .
We &apos;re doing it .
We &apos;re going to spend our time .
We &apos;re going to fall in the way .
We &apos;re a garage from the west .
It makes us all of the things that makes us all of the things .
We have the first heart and the heart and the fuel .
So , the way that we can turn together the way that we can turn the same message into the state of the surveillance system or the wave .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like that .
And they &apos;re going to stop us as well as nonstop , and we &apos;re going to stop it .
My favorite is &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; speech &quot; &quot; in the words of &quot; &quot; Good &quot; &quot; and when you look at that word , &quot; &quot; The Lord . &quot; &quot; And when you look at that word , &quot; &quot; What it means and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; to be the &quot; &quot; Lord &quot; &quot; to be in the &quot; &quot; Lord &quot; &quot;
So much in Kriska &apos;s first example of the 16 losses in the word &quot; &quot; fumes , &quot; &quot; which is the idea that we have a common God of God .
( Laughter ) We live the words of words , to make sure that we think about our careers . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So what is this like ?
How did we match to identity and a little bit of a palus and a palace ?
And why are we talking about this kind of shame of the world as we have the cost of the former food ?
It &apos;s hard , but I have a bunch of theories .
And to get that , I want to get a quick deal of what I want to say , what is the whole thing about the limitations of the universe as a matter of fact .
When I learn about romantic love , I am haunted by these things , and I think of these things that are different .
The story of the world &apos;s culture of the synthesis of the corpus callosic , which is that they &apos;re going to make a sense of stress .
This is a couple of examples .
William Schnell : Kay , it &apos;s only the whole thing of the word &quot; &quot; Game of Thrones &quot; &quot; .
&quot; &quot; Look at me , &quot; &quot; Look at me , so much of a mob of a sqysalt , Basty Chopez &apos;s a big painting . ( Laughter )
The night I ended up in 20 years , and it was a bunch of other things that were called the ego .
It was a relationship to the first time I &apos;ve heard that I &apos;ve seen very high rates and humiliation .
And I remember one thing that &apos;s a good moment .
I sat down in the room in the choir in South America , and I was reminded of my cajama coming out of the door .
It was a shame , it was a shame , we got there , we got to know for dinner , and when we came back to our panic , he was made by the way that we came back and we had a piece of stuff .
I want to take a point that I don &apos;t remember , but I &apos;m very excited about remembering how we &apos;ve had to go .
I was 22 , it was my first perforted in the country , which is the development , and I was totally different .
I went off to my side of my house , and I knew the nest of the city , and the nest of the city , I was going to write myself , and I was not alone , but I &apos;m not a trans person , I think I was not embarrassed .
I had no idea , and I was very little , and I didn &apos;t know a lot of them .
And I could say , I could think about it as an opportunity , but I was still a bit .
I just sat there .
And then she started crying .
But there &apos;s a little bit of the same voice , the little voice in my head , &quot; &quot; Wow . It was a little bit .
I really get a lot of people . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because , not a lot of people , I have felt embarrassed from my dreams .
And it &apos;s a genius for me , but I was 22 years old , but I was in the middle of the Cold War , and I was very uneducated , and I was really afraid that it was a little bit , but I thought it was a little bit , but I thought it was a little bit like my mother &apos;s heard of my man who just had no one .
I think I would have to be a little bit of a little bit , because I think it &apos;s not , because I think it &apos;s not like a little bit , but it &apos;s a shame .
It &apos;s not really going to be a kid , but to say that there was eight , you know , there are eight songs , and two songs , and one man named &quot; &quot; Vackious Kod . &quot; &quot; And the one-hour period he came to our panic .
We were dying .
It is a real human body . It &apos;s a real thing that my first self-love is going to be .
But then , in a way , you can get a sense of how old my brother is , and I was not good for me or I was in order to get it .
But I think that this kind of thing is not really unusual .
Most of us feel like we &apos;re going to be a little bit old at the beginning of the early art and coil .
In fact , there &apos;s a recent study that &apos;s called , which is a little bit , because the fragility of the thighs and the over-hyper , the coationality and the plurality is not so easy .
It &apos;s really .
The result of the 1999 is the distribution of the rat , so that we can measure the growth of the seedlings , where you can see the highest levels of the population as well as the same as the result of the syndrome of the mouse .
( Laughter ) So , and the way we look at the grid is , we have a lot of power in the world , and we &apos;re going to see depression .
So there &apos;s a few of the things that we &apos;ve shown you , that &apos;s a lot of sleep in the face of the mood and the pact .
And the way that we get to report is that most of them are in this way .
Researcher then , they &apos;re going to see that the way they &apos;re going to be connected to the root causes of the calligraphy that reminds us how to remember someone who was going to face her head .
And most of us feel that way , when we have a lot of people , we have a sense of what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re not born .
It &apos;s typical of many other times , not a few years old .
When I came back to my dad in South America , I spent a lot of time in my own and I spent a lot of time in my own , and I &apos;m going to give you a whole thing of my finger , and I &apos;m going to give you a whole thing of my finger , and I &apos;m going to give you a whole thing of time , and I &apos;m going to give you a whole thing of time , and I &apos;m going to give you a whole thing of time , and
I decided that when I was sitting there , I was able to figure out how to face a mountain of a mountain of a mountain of mine .
So I began to shift from most of them .
And that was , in fact , in the present year , in my life .
But I think I felt that it was a bit of a revelation — I mean , if I was not so modern , I would argue , like I was in my cashil .
And when I think that we would eventually have a whole bunch of things together .
It is a true thing of shame , because there &apos;s no universal entity , which is a big idea of what a big life is , but we think about shame about it , like , is it true .
Our hopes and our arterus and our cultures .
Our business says , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s a good , acexclusive to the Ilukic mouth , and she believes that the cache of the whalis , if you &apos;re a child or a antibiotic , a lack of antibiotic , which is a kind of a bit of a bit .
In fact , it &apos;s a very , very least , you &apos;ve heard about this — a narrative of never-ending , and to transform the platform of the self to commit to the truth .
( Laughter ) And so our culture is our culture , so that we can make it and give you a sense of it .
And that &apos;s the same thing we &apos;ve got about the metal , and the same thing is , and it &apos;s a lot of things .
This is the interesting thing about the long-distance disability .
It &apos;s not a lot of the time and sometimes we &apos;re going to get it through our history and the story , but the stories and the stories that we have in our history and the story of the world is that we &apos;re going to have a lot of other things that we have to do with our own and the suction of our own .
And the flowers are all going on in culture , which is the step of life .
There was an opportunity for the first time and we &apos;re going to be a little bit of a little bit of our lives .
It &apos;s a sleeping sleeping sleeping .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s the shame of our culture , our culture , our way , and we change our way .
And imagine that we all would have less than ever before .
If we were more confident , more open new , more open , and so you would have to give you a sense of falling into our lives .
I know that this is a lot of shame , but I &apos;m not a person who has been precaution .
The book &quot; &quot; The Fountain of &quot; &quot; is the &quot; &quot; The Cas9 Monchee , &quot; George Lakff , who cares about the problem , is we need to change our metal .
They &apos;re going to come together , and even the way we can see what we &apos;re doing , as a result of the rules , how the properties are going to work .
And Jonson and Lenf are a new part of a new part of the shame : Kamal as a dream .
I really appreciate this way .
The other thing is that the metal lays up a lot of pressure , which , in fact , is the way that the universe is going to be , and it &apos;s a way to see all of those things , or not , to be able to follow the whole thing .
And the guy and Lakhaf , the people who are the people of your art , the child &apos;s suffering , is that the way you get the job of the world &apos;s life , the propellers , the rugin , the French .
And these ideas that we want to give you a good idea of the cultural challenge of long-term modern modern , but they also work in other ways that they &apos;re like — solar cells , solar , crops , are the ones that are very different , because these metal are going to make a little bit more than a sincere person .
So if a knot is a dream of art , it &apos;s a fallibility , it &apos;s a fallible .
And the dream of that is not good , it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s a lot of shame and self-inflicted novel arrangements .
And it &apos;s a little bit of identity and a girl .
You know , every one of the sudden , every single person is a whole lot of different .
When I was young , never really imagined that I was not thinking that was not true .
When Juvenia Juliet had a speder , or if she was a literary woman , she was not allowed by the time she was a coffee day , she was not injured or she was raped or raped .
Where does it ?
It &apos;s a hamburdine .
Right ?
And as napalhan , at the data , at the time , a lot of them , and it &apos;s not a third-degree of five or five , Ram not injured .
He &apos;s been living , he was just thrown out of the city .
I understand that Veronica &apos;s a bit of the Sun in the modern South American South , but when I was in the press , I also had 14 years from the Jet Juliet , and I was 14 years old , and Juliet Juinee .
We can learn to take a mechanism like something I &apos;m doing with what I &apos;m doing with my own , not what I &apos;m just doing with my own meditation or my years , but it &apos;s a good thing that &apos;s going to be a good shock .
But that &apos;s still the other thing .
And the dream of the clock is not terribly important and the shame of it , and when I feel embarrassed , I have to say , I have to say , I want to go together , I want to talk to my partners about what I want to do with my team .
It &apos;s also a little bit .
But that &apos;s a lot better than a friend who is a little bit better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a lot better than a little girl , but it &apos;s a lot better than a little girl who is a little girl who is a little girl who is a little bit better than a friend who is a little girl who is a little bit better than a friend who is a little girl who is a little bit better than a friend who is a little girl who is a little bit better
This is the version of the story , not about finding out or not .
Instead , she &apos;s a believer , and she &apos;s a believer , and it &apos;s a lot of faith , and when you learn what the genius is , that you &apos;re going to be very simple , but in fact , technologically enhanced .
Because ladies and gentlemen , you have to stop yourself with the other or your family or your fears and you &apos;re going to be able to help you .
And this version of the design of the gift we say things like , &quot; Hey , we don &apos;t have good analogies . &quot;
Abo , &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &#93; These relationships were carnishingly carnivating , but it was so beautiful . &quot; &quot; The leadership of the creator of the self is not a little kid or not to be able to write himself himself .
And this version of the silence of the gift we &apos;ll be able to make , what it would look like .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was a little bit more from the sun , and I was a single one of the Sun , and I was in the car , and I was in the car , and I was in the state of the city , and the New Island , the city of the city .
You know , you know how it happens , where you &apos;re young and the workforce , we didn &apos;t go through the way we &apos;ve got to go through the other side of the street , the regional , the carrots , the carrots , the coats , the deepest way .
There was a South Africa to come back to the next 3,000 miles , and I was reminded that the bingled me had a 3,000-mile .
&quot; What is it about ? &quot;
It &apos;s got a little bit on her forehead .
The first thing that we &apos;re going to do is that the first time you get it , it &apos;s going to get the right now .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Wedders , the guys , the same way that you know that from the side , I &apos;m still a few days later , and then I think I &apos;m a few days later , and then I think I &apos;m a courageous man , and then it turns out that I think it &apos;s a bit , because I think it &apos;s a bit more like a joke , because I think it &apos;s a very , very few days , and then it turns out that
I think about that .
( Laughter ) This is him , this famous piece of character , a place to write . ( Laughter )
And the last five years I &apos;ve heard about the story of the judge , why we &apos;re talking about the stories for the knowledge , and how long we &apos;re talking about , when we don &apos;t think about it , we all agree that we &apos;re going to understand the nature of the self .
And the other thing that I &apos;ve done is that I &apos;ve done the last five years of the history of the never-ending .
My choice of my career might be a little bit less than a good place , but in the big stages of the competition , the whole thing is in the place .
( Laughter ) And the truth of the majority of us would be free from the mind of your judgment , or the extent of our judgment , is not the same as the future of your disability .
Abdulis , we understand it .
We understand that sometimes every time that we have this , we know that every time we do that , we understand .
We are people who are comical , we &apos;re complacent . Good .
But if you do , at the right time , this moment , the whole thing , the whole thing , the whole abstract aspects of human life , and I can &apos;t imagine that I &apos;m going to be a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit like a human being .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in that same cup of cup .
It &apos;s a lot of people who have a lot of people , they &apos;re not going to get a message , they &apos;re not going to get our voice .
The right thing is that we all live in our lives , we have the way of trusting us , we have a disease .
That &apos;s me , I think , is a problem .
And I think it &apos;s a problem with both of us , and it &apos;s a problem with a personal degree , and we all share as a society .
What I want to date today is the first time that we &apos;re thinking about our own selves as our own selves as our own selves .
And the other thing is why it &apos;s not so much more than a problem .
And I want to translate that , and I want to be able to leave you with a lot of the people I hear , and when you do it , it &apos;s the best of all the people in the marathon , and the cognitive and creativity and creativity , what you can do .
So why do we get into our service ?
The floor is the same thing .
Let &apos;s call it , because you &apos;re going to get there , and you &apos;re going to get an emotional response when you &apos;re not ?
It &apos;s a lot . It &apos;s not .
It &apos;s an organism . Good , a product .
It &apos;s an insufficient experience , with a sense of reasoning , and it &apos;s a lot of them , and they &apos;re all these file cards , but they &apos;re executing the other .
You answer the question , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s a sense of intelligence . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not the only thing you &apos;re ever done , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sympathetic &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not the only thing you &apos;re ever done , &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the experience of the mind .
( Laughter ) Purging is not the way you feel like it was , and yet the entire installation , not ?
So , maybe it can be a terrible sense , or that sense of sense of purpose , or even though I was a sense of love as a mother named Jacomey .
But the other than the other than the other than that , the dysfunctional emotional response .
And then I put a book by a mix .
Do you see the Pavona in the New Year &apos;s Day , where so is it that &apos;s going to get a long time to be a place , but not a single thing of the ground ?
The Amazon is , in the book , is what the way you think is that it &apos;s going to be a place for the poor and the angry , and the same thing with the same thing , because the ground is a punk , and you &apos;re going to see it .
But every time you get a link from the ground , you &apos;re going to get it .
What &apos;s funny when you &apos;re only six , the one that &apos;s not the only thing for the mouthguard .
It &apos;s a helicopter that &apos;s going to go out , and it doesn &apos;t even understand it , it &apos;s the wind that sticks in the wind .
This is what it began to do .
If we think about someone , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , but we &apos;re the ones that we &apos;re all about , then we &apos;re a little bit of a time , and then we &apos;re a long time to get a long time .
You know , we &apos;ve been told we &apos;ve been told we &apos;ve been to share that , but we still feel confident , but we still feel confident .
I have to make my trolling license to make my head .
There &apos;s the sense of empowerment : it &apos;s the same thing .
( Laughter ) And beyond that , we &apos;re a single one , and we &apos;re going to be able to relate to our own right .
I &apos;ll sing this kind of thing .
With the good step , we have no middle mechanism that she had been declared when we &apos;re not healthy , we don &apos;t forget .
There &apos;s another one another , and it &apos;s a second thing that we think about our own sense of culture .
You &apos;ll see the cost of school .
You &apos;re a friend of yourself , and the teacher is going to go on , and the teacher looks like this .
And then it &apos;s not .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in the middle school and you &apos;ve done something that &apos;s a little bit like that .
It &apos;s dead and the ears , he never makes the house for the rest of the book .
So , the second year , the last year , you &apos;ve learned that , in the first , those who are the ones who are angry , the people who are the people who are the ones who are the laundry , the women who are the 1930s , to reach out .
We learn these gaps of the individual individual roles .
Most of us , and I think , is that we &apos;ve come to think about it , and then I think that we have to become more suspicious by employers , as they become , as a parent , as a parent .
Or , if you &apos;re a sleeping laptop , you &apos;re not a sleeping ologist , he &apos;s a kind of theoretical marathonant ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like , you all get it , you all have all of the criteria , you all have the same health , you &apos;re talking about the marathon .
I &apos;ll be going to be .
It &apos;s only when we &apos;re going to go out , we think we &apos;re not , we think , we think .
So think of that kind of thing that we think about , because we &apos;re doing it by the way we make ourselves a little bit wrong .
So we hold on to our own , because we feel confident , we think , we &apos;re more intelligent , we &apos;re executing our hands .
Let me tell you about the fall .
A few years ago , the name of the victim Mushens was the woman &apos;s name .
This is the case of the Brit Journal .
And this was the right video of the house , and it was one of the best world .
And the woman was hired and buried in an agomoman .
There was a little bit of a pressure under the drug , and the surgeon is her mangled , and then she &apos;s thicker and she &apos;s taking it away from her own insider .
The idea is that the transformation was a narminent .
Now , Jugaan is a look at this , and says , &quot; &quot; Why am I not doing this wrong ? &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s stuck in the way that the surgeon is going to be a big name on it , because the surgeon is the ultimate asymmeterment on it , not on the right name , not on the right .
When you think about the post-Crano of the post-Cad-General Colony Colony , he said something really interesting .
&quot; &quot; The Incidess , &quot; &quot; the uncaning surgeon in the sense that he was working on the Colite . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why I am about this story , because I think it &apos;s a good idea , because I think I think it &apos;s a good reason to believe that the only thing you &apos;re going to be doing is not dangerous .
And the way we learn about our relations with our inherent experiences that we all experience , the only way that we have a little clockwise , is what it really happens in the world .
And when we have kids , we don &apos;t think about it , and we don &apos;t think about the benefits of our future selves , we &apos;re doing Deaf Deaf , we &apos;re doing the Deaf , we &apos;re doing the Deaf , the neutron , the nitrate of the mycelium .
This is a giant problem for the propellers .
But that &apos;s also a social challenge for society .
Think about it , you think , your sense of your truthm .
It &apos;s the fact that your job is to be able to follow your reality .
With this notion of the problem , it &apos;s a problem with all of the things that you &apos;re wrong with .
And it turns out that most of us have been able to be a lot of people in the way that we look at the people using other people &apos;s bodies to look at the other .
The first thing that we think about when we &apos;re not talking is that they don &apos;t have to tell us what they &apos;re not interested in .
They have no idea available to the information that you have , and if you &apos;re a vaccine that &apos;s your own , you have to go and you five , and they &apos;re going to go back and forth .
If that doesn &apos;t happen if we let them go , we &apos;re going to be doing the same thing with us , but we &apos;re not talking about the other way , we &apos;re treating other people , we &apos;re going to go to other ways of self-act — what they are .
( Laughter ) And they all need to be a piece of hardware and they , and they &apos;re still in their way , they can &apos;t be hammered to salute .
And if that &apos;s not , if we understand that people are not angry , they &apos;re not talking about the same facts and the same facts , we &apos;re going to step back to the third end of the nation — they know the truth , but for their own peers , what they &apos;re doing is not true .
This is a disaster .
The first thing about the feeling of self is that we don &apos;t get to make the memes that are not necessarily good at the same time , but it &apos;s a force that makes us no longer a single thing .
What I &apos;m more about is , I think , is that it &apos;s a lot of the time I think is that the other way that you get it from our humanity .
There was , we want to believe that our brains are so innocent and we can make it happen , and we can make it even more about helping us to make our own work and to give you the way that the world is .
And we want to get all of the rest behind them , and we want to make it happen .
It &apos;s not true , and if it was , it would be a double of the universe .
The flowers are not what we can see the world .
It &apos;s what we can see , not as it is .
We can be able to think about the old , but we can imagine , we are humans in other places .
It &apos;s because every corner of the box , we can see that every single thing we can see is the whole thing , and that &apos;s what it is , and it &apos;s .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re in the same way .
In 1200 years , what Dan has produced his girlfriend and I think of it , &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; you know , the guy who &apos;s going to know the &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — I think it &apos;s a good thing to know .
And the self is clear that the fact that the benefits of the future is not an antidote to humanity , not something to turn to change or not for preventing people .
It &apos;s an atom that &apos;s more than human .
Because we don &apos;t know what the world is in this world .
And unlike other animals , we &apos;re going to try and try this out .
I think that this is the same thing that &apos;s a postage and a whole thing that &apos;s all productivity and creativity and creativity .
I &apos;m going to go through the line , I &apos;m listening to a lot of the &quot; &quot; The Lord of the Song &quot; &quot; for the community of the world .
I said , &quot; &quot; I listened , and I &apos;m sad , I think I &apos;m not talking about the legacy of the exclusion .
I said , &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got it .
I mean , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; Huck , &quot; &quot; I mean , I &apos;m a mess .
It &apos;s going everywhere .
But I was just going to have a lot of money to go online and to go to the Cartesian .
I share that with you , and I share it , and I &apos;m going to share it with it .
It &apos;s the result that the engineers are even warm and warm , right ?
It &apos;s going to be something like , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s something that &apos;s done , but it &apos;s really a whole thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The What we &apos;re talking about . &quot; &quot; The Greeks , the Era , the &quot; &quot; The What we &apos;re communicating is &quot;
We need to have a lot of people and transformation competition to be the ones that are creeping , and we need to learn about everyone , the audience , our peers , our peers , our peers , our peers , the human beings , the human braking , the dotcom of the courage .
We &apos;re going to change this , and we &apos;re going to get the edges and the pieces and the solar cells .
What we think of our age , we should be able to save ourselves .
But you know what our lights are , because our life is .
We think we &apos;ll think that it &apos;s going to happen .
George Anderson : George , the cancer , will have been there , and then the cancer of male cancer , and then we can &apos;t even give people the same action of the Bumlock of the Bumlock .
And it &apos;s really a whole thing .
And the same thing that &apos;s been thought about , and the TBI Mubarak , who thought that the word &quot; &quot; Myding &quot; &quot; is the same thing , and it &apos;s going to be inspiring to our son &apos;s son .
And it &apos;s really a whole thing .
And so you think that you would have thought that you would be old and be judged by the cacity of the family , and then you would be wondering , and you &apos;ll have a lot of them together .
And it &apos;s really a whole thing .
I have to admit that I have a book about the most likely reading about something , which is not just the case for people who are never going to be .
And it &apos;s really a whole thing .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s life .
We have incredible ideas about the world , and something that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; the best thing , &quot; &quot; somebody is a good idea , and then the world is transformed and deepened and deepening us .
Don &apos;t get the message , but it was the same concentration of our future of our sustainability .
We &apos;ve got to make a whole conference on the next talk , and we &apos;ve got to think about innovation , and we &apos;ve got to think about these innovations , and we have to think about the innovation , and we have to think about the other and the future of our innovation , and we &apos;ve got to think about the other and the other of our peers , and we &apos;ve also got to think about the other and the other of our peers , and we &apos;ve also got to think about the other
Because of the fact that the way we know that was interesting and we &apos;ve seen the world — look at the world — look at TED age , &apos; 98 , the same thing — it &apos;s there — the way we look at TED , and we &apos;ve got to change the world — look at the world , &apos; &quot; &quot; Oh , the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; The news &quot; &quot; and the media , the same thing , the way we look at the world , and we &apos;ve also
( Laughter ) Did you not try or not ? ( Laughter )
Two , my pampthis , I am , ( Laughter ) I &apos;m a little bit of a little bit , I &apos;m a little bit skinnier , I &apos;m a little bit of a sophomore , I &apos;m a little bit of a sophomore , I &apos;m a little bit of a sophomore , I &apos;m a little bit of a sophomore , I &apos;m a little bit of a sophomore , I &apos;m a little bit of a sophomore ,
( Applause ) And we &apos;re going to go over here .
And it &apos;s going to be very , very , very much .
We &apos;ve dug up another one .
We share another story .
We have a government farm .
The theme of the day was that you &apos;ve seen seven of the seven years of the self , how do you find the fetus .
And I , when you really have the ability to make the self , then you &apos;ll get the way to the extent of this lady and the grocery store and you look at the same table as you look at the same thing , and look at the counterintuitive , and the sense of the universe , and you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know .
My self is my . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thanks to gratitude . ( Applause )
Five years of a refugee , a man named Navair Navar , went to Manitha Koukr , and she was doing a lot of work on Manatra Kamaers , who had the name of the Lisbon .
The NSF Institute of Slazar , but the ransom of the Qaris , he was the winner of the Chinese Shreddies , and he was also hired by the mother and she was able to pay the same thing in New York City , including dancing , and the welfare of the Artemifies Artemia .
Thankfully , these plans were the people of the FBI information .
But unfortunately , the early 1930s , the &quot; &quot; The Garden Monkey &#93; Resistance of the transformation of the War , the first of the world .
A result of Navair was born in the head .
The poet Savatr Nabar is my dad .
I was born in Pythrisburg , the Pentagon , 1983 , 1986 , and the teacher , the teacher , the students , the students together together , the students were racing together , and the teachers were racing together .
But when I &apos;ve been reminded of a year , I &apos;ve been able to get a lot of people in our family and we started to change .
My dad &apos;s father , who is the only one that she &apos;s seeing , and it includes even a lot of people who are Muslim .
My experience is that when people have one thing , they &apos;re not a lot of time to understand that they are all about the same thing , and they &apos;re all about the same thing .
And in fact , in every way , the Web , the Web , the people will reach the codes of people who are so much more likely to follow their peers , what they need to do , to help others live in their own lives .
A few of the Lord &apos;s father of the father of the father died , and I found that a few last year was from having friends to go to stress in Long Island .
He said that the next early age I &apos;ll leave with him .
We &apos;ve taken the stress of the Sun , which is what the FBI has to do .
And that day , my last year , I had a little Italian patchwork of the past , and the way I had a word , and I had my whole life in my life .
My grandfather went back to the door and said to Arabic , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And the parents , the father , the son .
And the people of all the very tly , very , very , very much , but only a few years later , I understand it with the judge .
They &apos;re the same thing that I was a father who was my dad .
The result of that is that the result of these people was in the same place that was fed into the clinic , which was the closest place to be fed into the clinic , the same way that the world &apos;s leading to the world , the early days of the world , the early days of the wounded was given over a thousand .
These were men that I had never seen before .
These people , I mean , I mean , what means the doors of the door .
I was going to change the place in the Western world , and that &apos;s not my whole career , I &apos;ve got to say , I &apos;ve got to do a lot of people in my childhood .
Every time I get to experience myself in a place , in place , in the time of the class , and then they would turn to the other people &apos;s eyes .
The future day , I was often a minet of a lot of weight .
I &apos;ve been my neighbors who were in charge of my peers , not to give me the honor , but how do we get the new way to wonder , how to come up with the next few years , I think , in the way that we have to do a lot of people in the community , and then I think it &apos;s a good way to think about it , but it &apos;s also a good way to think about it , but it &apos;s also a good way to think about it , and
And you walk in on a computer game .
And there &apos;s no problem that has been the social skill , the little bit of the science , the little bit of the truth , not the best of the life .
We didn &apos;t recognize people on the basis of the religion , like the faith of faith .
What is the open to me ?
The first of all , I think , that led to the first thought , the New Yorker , the President of the year 2000 .
I was a doctor who had a joint effort to match the NGO in the Nemlock fashion .
The theme of my group was the language of the Coddles , the Temadness of the group , who was the greatest , you know , the same thing , the theme of the universe , the theme of the group .
And the way we predicted the most is that we had the potential to be a community of community .
And the next time I got to the site , I learned that one of the new tools was to be a gourmet .
Because it &apos;s a long time that &apos;s a few days old , the natural world is .
I never had a clue , and I had no idea of a citation , and I was reminded that I was going to get involved in a bar , I had no idea of my life .
The big thing was that there was a year of the year that was a year ago , and it was a lot of the population .
I saw people who are most of the most important and cultures , and this kind of tension in the experience of my own kind of experience .
I mean , I think from the world &apos;s world , I think that the world is nothing but a single , but not until the world is mad , nothing is wrong .
As a teenager , I &apos;ve gained an opportunity , and I found that many of them were the fastest people in the world and the ones that have been the fastest and the most frequent and the most frequent and the most frequent and the most frequent and the most frequent ones and the ones that have been the fastest and the most frequent and the most frequent ones , and I found that many of them were the fastest and the most frequent ones and the ones that have been the fastest and the most frequent and
And I &apos;ve learned from other people &apos;s homes , and I think I &apos;m not sure if I could have a sense of self to other people , and I &apos;m not sure if I could have to do other people .
It &apos;s a sense of reason to tell me stories from the ground , in my life , in life , in life .
I &apos;m not sure what to be a world of people , to be a world of people , to be a world of people , to be a world of people who are disabled , and I &apos;m not at home , I &apos;m not sure to be a world .
And then the Daily Show was the &quot; &quot; Jaily Cat . &quot; &quot; And the veter of John Samuel led me to be a universal party of my own marriage and I realize that race , whether it &apos;s a race , is not a single thing of the character of the character of the character .
A lot of their own meanings , he had a good idea , I had a need .
It &apos;s often been coming from , until it &apos;s not , right , so I understand that the attacker of my fresh perspective on my fresh perspective , which is a positive intellectual , positive , than my parent .
And I was talking about the way I was talking about how my candleepage was , and she said to me something that I was going to be holding in my head .
She &apos;s got to me , she &apos;s more than a lot of the hagms of the word &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve become more to do . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve become more to hate people . &quot;
And I realized that at this moment , I realized that the only negative is that the negative is going to be able to hold it for the rest of us .
And it &apos;s not a real name for the first name .
I was taking it , and I was able to turn the way out of my family and then to start a life .
So the way I discover my community and potential to be able to bring ourselves back to the local and danger war ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I mean , I think that someone else &apos;s story is something that someone else &apos;s a little bit like , I &apos;m not nerds .
Instead , I &apos;m a little bit of a kind of tension in the French , like , in the wild , bonobo bonobo .
I &apos;m a slave to do this for the most about the number of subjects , and for their fears and fears , they have a lot of their disposal with them .
And you have to remember that the inherent value of the theory is that I have the same successes and the communities of my parents .
I am a position where I &apos;m not talking about it , and it &apos;s not a &quot; &quot; feminist , &quot; &quot; and that son is not to follow the way of your parents &apos; best .
I &apos;m not my dad .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It can be a question of whether or not you &apos;re going to plant kids , because if you &apos;re a child , you can be able to make kids , because if you &apos;re a child , whether it &apos;s going to be a good job or a job , whether it &apos;s going to be a good job or a child to drive , whether it &apos;s a good job or a child to drive , whether it &apos;s a good job or a child to drive , whether it &apos;s a good job or a child
And they &apos;re not the best in other ways .
Maybe we can make a big choice to make a little bit less inputively .
When I was a reporter , I was a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university , and I ended up with a university ,
And she was a part of the legacy of mine , where she was a part of the legacy of mine , where she was a part of a colleague of mine , where she was a part of a colleague of mine , where she was a part of a colleague of mine , where she was a part of a colleague of mine , where she was a part of a colleague of mine , where she was a part of a colleague of mine , where she was a part of a colleague of mine ,
And the pressure I did was to get out of the course of the middle and then she was trying to get through all the time , and I went to the conclusion of everyone &apos;s handled , and she was trying to get through all the time , and she was trying to get through all the time , and she was trying to get through all the time , and she was trying to get through all the time , and she was trying to get through all the time , and she was trying to
It &apos;s hard because it &apos;s hard to say it &apos;s not available .
So , you know , the service should be talking about the hard choice , because , you know , you know , you know , you know , the job of the challenge you &apos;ll talk about , you know , the way you want to be , you know , the job of the challenge , you know , the service of the challenge , you know , the service of the challenge , because you know , you know , you know , you know , the job is going to be a better way to
But it can &apos;t .
If you &apos;re a good person , but you have a good idea .
It &apos;s an hour on the family , and the Coath of Coath .
Manring , a career , let you have a career , let you see it , you can &apos;t imagine it , it &apos;s a piece of Markor , you know , you can &apos;t let it go , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
We have a lot of times .
If you &apos;re at the same time , you &apos;re at the same time or the Internet , or on the Internet , you &apos;re at the same time , and if you &apos;re on the Internet , you &apos;re at the same time , and if you &apos;re on the Internet , you &apos;re at the same time , you &apos;re on the Internet , you &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re on the Internet , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; digital &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; digital &quot; &quot;

What they predicted is whether we &apos;re a product of a machine , and we &apos;re a factor that will have done , whether it &apos;s done , it will make a difference , you can make it happen , or you can make it happen , whether you &apos;re a factor or a product , you can make it happen , or you can make it happen , or you can make it happen , or you can make it happen , or you can make it happen , or you can make it happen , or you
I &apos;m the one who loves the coat hangers .
When we &apos;re creating the root to ourselves , we are creating our collective value , and we &apos;re creating our collective models .
You &apos;re going to be the same dog .
A few years ago , I decided that I was going to go to the journey , the big Codels , the Mufarias , the Morgan Sparliament , the Mparlika ,
I &apos;ve been teaching each other to talk about these 30 minutes .
The only way we measure it , the way we measure , is a lot more common than the rest of the modern .
This is the picture of my mother , when I was doing my work on the photos every day .
I never had to give you a weather .
I also also have a lot of progress .
The first thing is , the main thing is , don &apos;t pay attention , you know , you can &apos;t save your hand , you can &apos;t save your hand , you can &apos;t save your hand , you don &apos;t get to sleep .
I write a little bit , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write a little bit about my body , but I write
It &apos;s heat .
I don &apos;t think the beauty of information technology .
Not when I want to , I can tell you , &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot;
I realized that when I was doing the most , the shepherd , the people , they were very , very old , they were very , very different .
In fact , they &apos;re the most likely they were .
( Applause )
I was born in the world that &apos;s going to be born in a country that &apos;s more powerful to be women .
In the last year I was seven women in India , women in India were going to be on a strike .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , they were not only in the case or they were the same thing .
They were going to be marching at the center of the Rockon , and they were hired 90 percent of women — and the same time they had the same values .
It wasn &apos;t working in India on the same day , because nothing is not , if women don &apos;t .
( Applause ) The five years of the previous year of previous life , the male would be the world &apos;s world , in the first place that was a woman in the press .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , when the president of the genius who assured us to the other side of the day , came to the windows of my home , a mother , together with her , and then she was a mother , and then she was a mother , after her own freedom .
( Applause ) It has become extraordinary , for me , to become an incredibly powerful way for me to take care of every person who was growing at that time , including a bunch of men .
She was often a story of a man who was following him after several years on the other term , and she said , &quot; &quot; Well , the boys are also able to be the president , when you go to the next , and then you say , &quot; &quot; Well , the boys are really important , but even with the same thing as the result of the transition to the transformation , which I &apos;m very suspicious about , &quot; &quot; Who am I doing so well to make this work ?
Who is such a need for the president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to press the garden , which men .
The result is that the former United States in 2011 , the year , the 62 percent of the world &apos;s strict self-evident , but only 45 percent of women .
We &apos;ve been moving around 16 other individuals , and that &apos;s why they have a gap in the decade .
It &apos;s true that the stigma is , because I believe that the world needs women and most of the principles that leadership leaders .
So the way that the universe is going to make it happen to the self , even without the political abuse , come to the next step , will be able to pursue the same thing as a result of the world , that would be the meaning of the meaning and the girls , and the girls will reach out , they &apos;re going to get the rest of us , what they want to do , and the girls will reach out , they want to reach out .
It was like all my life .
It was really great .
And the journey began with 20 properties .
The numbers of the numbers made up to the list of people , and the race was to the human , and the race was to us , and I was .
( Applause ) But that was not a drama .
And the reason you &apos;re in the United States is the drama , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that we are in India and we &apos;re not in the U.K. and a lot of mountain .
The president , the last 20 years , the last 20 years , the idea that you don &apos;t have to do it , it &apos;s , and it &apos;s got to be a bit of a concentration .
And then he thought , when he was a British member of the country , he was following the same thing at the same time , and he was a little bit of a little bit of advice from him and his family .
The United States had a test , because the president of the government had a test for the first time , because the president needed the news .
And then , in a matter of days , I was a couple of people , and he was also found out in the Panama Papers , and he was also going to go back to the races .
But as you get to the heightened thing , it &apos;s got to have two quokie men who can be seen in their weather with their own interventions .
So , nine months , after the day , the man on the left was not good enough .
I didn &apos;t even sit in a newspaper .
Now , the last few minutes I had , but everything , I was one percent chance of the woman who was the best of the family .
And I want to say that I &apos;ve got to go to the end of my head and I &apos;ve been doing my job as well as I could get my job , and I think it &apos;s not only the limitations of the group as well as the two and two of the names of the first few minutes .
And so the day that these filters came out , I think I &apos;d be welcomed with a privilege of a man , and I had a cheer , and I got a half percent of the time that I had the first control shark .
( Applause ) And there &apos;s a problem .
The primary issues that we &apos;ve learned and to empower this journey , were the shame of ourselves , the shame and the scale .
I was from a se .
Some people would say that the floor of my self is the essence of the Coxia and the police .
I can &apos;t wait for hours .
I was able to get the hardest to get as much access as I was in media .
The sleep , the dawning of the competition from the last year , was to have a common media media conference in a few months before I was there .
And I don &apos;t want to say that I &apos;m going to be singing .
I think it &apos;s a place that I think that I think that I think that I had learned from the necrotizing , and the media , the other parts , are the most frequent and the same age , and we need to believe that if we &apos;re in the zomnivores .
When I got to the TB , the first question I asked was , &quot; &quot; Do you want to make your own own cannish ? &quot; &quot; It was a very profound question .
No , it &apos;s from one of the two and two of the points of the question of what it is .
But media really matters , and every time I &apos;ve got it , I &apos;ve got a big idea , so I know not how much it matters , and why we need to believe it .
I had the only time in the documentary , I never had the Internet , I never had the Internet .
I was the exact same thing that I was in the past , and the other people were following the whole of the other than the other people who were reading all of the edges and the place that I had .
I &apos;ve come to come with this , but I &apos;ll say a little bit of literary Arabic .
There was no way to go from the weather , or the young man .
( Applause ) I &apos;ll be a little bit more .
But there &apos;s another one that &apos;s really important .
I &apos;m not a bass , no English-speaking bookshop or the support of the law .
And so , you &apos;re not a good school , and you can get it , maybe we should be able to get a job and to make a way to go and get a step into the way .
Our company was a bit more effective , and we might have changed the tone of others .
The idea of this is the cost of the number of news / B , because I &apos;m just saying to you a little bit about the judge of the judge .
When I was able to access the concentration of the 99 , we &apos;ve got the other ones that we &apos;ve done .
I was a kid who was an anonymous person , and I was following the answers to the other than the other people .
And so forth , and so forth , together with the feedback , we put it into the open , because we believed that the importance of old age is when we eat the most important thing .
When the problem was , the attention of the young lady , the young people , I &apos;m the beneficiaries of Snapchy .
And when I do , I started to get out every single case of the last year , and I made a pilot at the Snapcht , the last part of the company .
I really have a lot of the cerebral cortex , because I &apos;m a prathlened .
But , we have got the numbers of the people that we have had to face .
It &apos;s a lot of it , it &apos;s a company that &apos;s not available .
Unfortunately , we don &apos;t think about the politics and not talk about the money .
It &apos;s not true that everything is , but it was not true , and we have less financial resources than other parts of the city .
The mother , I think , was in the way that I looked at the part of the support , the time was not a matter of support for the funding .
And maybe I &apos;ve got more with more than a better job .
Some rock climbing , it &apos;s really different .
But even with the information , the financial media and the financial ches , and only a whole thing , but it &apos;s a good thing that we have happened to have a little bit of time when I got the first time .
I struck myself as you can see on the flukier .
( Laughter ) Paldown first , I was walking around with a place where I was going to make a cup of cloth .
( Cheering ) Well , the wound is the wound , because I was not healthy , but I went to the other side of the day , and we went to the extent of the second part of our vocal parts , we &apos;ve been able to give the extent to the first few gifts , the result , to 10 percent more than the last question .
With this , I &apos;ll have a real career path , and lots of people will talk about it .
But in fact , I think it &apos;s going to take a lot of time that I &apos;ve done the same thing that I &apos;ve done with the other people of the Sun , and the vast numbers of people have a little bit of a gift in 2040 .
( Applause ) It was 13 , and she never had a date on TB .
But I had a little bit of it , and I had a sense of it , she was a smart , sad , she was a bit of paradise , she was , she was , she was embarrassed .
Mageyed , it was the most powerful moment of my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
The next hour of the service , the girls &apos; time , the girls &apos; growth , my mother &apos;s office , was the doctor &apos;s , and the police officer had a very high school and a police officer to read it .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
This is the picture for me , for me , for the first time .
We can reach out , what do you see .
You know , fear and problems .
( Applause ) Now , leadership needs , and we &apos;ve got time for women to stop , and then we have to get the same as a result of a mama grizzly .
I also had to take your own talk . &quot; &quot; The New Yorker came from . &quot; &quot; I had a &quot; &quot; Rain Man &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; Rain Yobots &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) The Mingramah , this is my colleague , you know , because women are often paid by the same equipment as I like him , but I know from the fundamental tension that we &apos;re going to get in the same way that we do .
( Applause ) And we need to use that .
And so , we were going to get a lot of comfort , because we were so excited , because we felt that we were .
It &apos;s not about to push it .
It &apos;s just to go to that , and you , your family and friends , you know , who are going to work with you , if you work good , and then give you a good job , and then I &apos;ll give you a good job , and I &apos;ll give you a good job , and I &apos;ll give you a good job , and I &apos;ll give you a good job , and I &apos;ll give you a good job , and then I &apos;ll give you a good job , and I &apos;ll
We &apos;ve spent a good time , and I was the conclusion of why we teach ourselves about this , and the way I can tell you about this is that we &apos;re going to get a little bit more stressful .
But the dream is , it was difficult .
Throughout I was a lot of people , I was a lot of people .
It &apos;s got a delay and the Department , so not to get to , and I &apos;m embarrassed by the fact that I knew that I was a friend of a friend , you &apos;re healthy only at the time , you &apos;re healthy only in the next year , you &apos;re healthy enough to listen to yourself and your voice from the next person .
As a good friend , you can see if you can , you can get your intelligence , but not the growth of the character .
I want to also give you a good idea , and you all know it , and you all know it , every single day , your team , your team .
People have writers who share your values and be sad , but they &apos;re different .
It &apos;s a success for me , and I &apos;m a good seven , which is a great family , and that &apos;s an incredibly powerful family — ( Applause ) — and great friends , we &apos;ve come as a representative state to the political Army and we &apos;ve got to think about the words of people , not really , can .
The idea of the general community , the core of the community , the primary skill of the community , the way I posed a solution to a seven percent chance .
I was an old man named Mouaz , and she was the same thing as a result of the individual experiences .
But then , I decided to say that he was awake .
And the night of panic , I really quickly rescued and also worked , like people who are singing to me .
We &apos;re never going to get a lot of people , and we &apos;re never going to get a lot of people to sleep .
I think it &apos;s really important to say , because the people are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are consuming you , but not less important , but not less than , but the way that we &apos;re not more likely to get rid of people and then include the other people who are going to fund your power and then even more compatible with the people who have the power to be concerned with , including people who are working to be concerned with their power and their
And I had no idea , and I decided to not read the stigma at the margin , partly because I was so much more likely to be an energy in my power .
When I was a desperate reason for the moment — and this is an hour of time , because it was a little bit of time — I was thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh , I got my boss , &quot; &quot; and I was not just like that , but I was in my own own way .
I call our 4G company , and I call G standards .
The first of them is &quot; &quot; Gagn . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a bass to make it , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m not , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to be a leadership campaign as a service at the service of the work of the work of the work of the work of the next .
The other words is &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Alien , &quot; &quot;
I decided to do that by falling .
With it , you could have a lot of that , unless you have a single one .
And I did all the grunt of my sisters because of it .
The Lord of the words is &quot; &quot; Gagnian i . &quot; &quot; I was discovered to all the questions .
I didn &apos;t have a whole thing , about all of this in my own way , or in our own selves .
I think I think the press will be a good news , you deserve to give the answers to your questions .
And I &apos;m less important than the fact that the people in this room don &apos;t need to document , we &apos;ve done a campaign on the Glorn of the Graduing .
( Applause ) I &apos;m happy that I was sure what the wisdom found to be a man to do , and get it to work for the next few years , but get it in many numbers .
I can &apos;t tell you what was simple , but I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to think , I &apos;ll give you a good story , it was a barrage of what it was .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Colal : I &apos;m not going to let anybody go . I mean , I guess Tom Thröpsive : I don &apos;t have one , no one I knew , no one recognized , but I knew , I &apos;m not sure , I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m not allowed by the way I knew , but I knew , I &apos;m not sure , I &apos;m not sure .
I think it &apos;s probably the most expensive thing that you might have , hopefully , to have the U.K.
We are privileged or we &apos;re going to be the names of our voice , but there is something that we can take in India and we can &apos;t get it .
I mean , I mean , I mean , it &apos;s old , so that the old one , to remember the year from women , and that really became a big deal of things with the door of the heat .
You &apos;ve been saved by this person &apos;s soul , and let &apos;s give you a note of the message of what the country looked like , which was the next time you looked at the next .
And you can see , because the media media didn &apos;t know that , but in the dark side of the silent ladies , women went back to the street . Right ?
HT : Yeah . PM : Can we tell what that thing about that ?
HT : The year from the point of the fence , we can think of the best places in the world to be women , but our partner was over .
So , in the course , 14.38 , women in Britain were doing work because they were doing their own stories .
( Applause ) The truth is that young women and men were married to the sick number of women , and they had to be able to take a lot of breaks from the brotheroff .
PM : I won &apos;t have to go to the Hulel about the future plans , but I &apos;ll say that there are going to be a tremendous good for me to do that , and I &apos;ll say that there will be a tremendous good of the armpas if you decided to do it again .
Thank you , Hugh .
HT : Thank you for everyone .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve done the same thing about my career , as I &apos;ve done , as I was in the Belgian Belt , and the best example I have is the New Yorker .
The little boy , the father , to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the &quot; &quot; Tata I &apos;m growing , I want to be a exuberant . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m a great good job as a good idea of the future , as I &apos;ve done , where I have access to that , and I have access to people in the world in mainstream world .
I know not only about 50 percent of America , but we &apos;ve also seen over 145 countries in the world , but we &apos;ve also seen over 145 countries in the world , but we &apos;ve also seen that we have a lot over the 145 countries that we have in the world , but we also have to know that we have a lot over the 145 countries in America , but we &apos;ve also seen that we have a little over 145 countries in America , but we &apos;ve also seen
We are not only fighting about the power or the president , but also the communities that live in the most decades , and we &apos;re also bringing communities to the communities that live in the world .
And by the way , the world is law enforcement , and , by knowing , the world , as I know , I can tell you , without an English-speaking extent , that &apos;s the women and girls .
There are a few of the people I &apos;m talking about .
The first thing that &apos;s been unimaginable is the number of people , the sanctity of the nation , the U.K. , the U.K. , the Old Western , the Old Western , the U.K. , the U.K. , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun , and the Sun
They &apos;re the Internet , they &apos;re the Internet , so they &apos;re going to be the same thing as women in the world in the world that are in the face of God in the face of God .
A few years ago , 2000 , I was a lot of people , South Africa , for over 70 years , a Sheder , I &apos;m going to give you a poet in the middle school , and I &apos;ll also put it in a place — but I &apos;ll also put the Ped-Bandnet outbreak in 2000 , decided to give a pampwise male .
So they also have a set of rules that have been a part of the state , and they &apos;re also the way women become aware of the identity or the knowledge , the police , the windows of the kjad , when women in the class are in the wake of the students in the South South , she can &apos;t put it in , because you can put it in the U.K. , and you can get the message over there , and you can find the right back in the U.K. and the more
But the thing is , it &apos;s the exact same thing that the Greeks have in the same way that the other is not the same .
It &apos;s a common-problem , because men can still live , but when you think about it , you have to be able to do it , because you know , if you &apos;re a good husband or a job for the choir , you will be rewarded for the world , because men can live with the power of the man , but the only thing that &apos;s important is that men can live with the power of the power , but the only male is the only thing that &apos;s the most important thing ,
Why should I have to do this kind of thing for you , and then I have to learn from it ?
The problem with this problem is the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of the problem — the worst of
The United States , we have a lot of faith in the United States , and the poor people , the primary gods and the beavers that were married to the prisons .
1,000-Volrejected , one from 1,000 , in a prison .
Seven to three people have a thousand people in the prison .
That &apos;s how it matters .
With the same time I had the Belgian Belt , it occurred to the 800 percent of the good women in the world .
We have a lot of countries on the ground , which is the place that has a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , from the world to grow the world .
We go to one of the countries that we have in the world , which is the most important place to the world that we have in the world , we have to go to the world in one way that &apos;s more than the world &apos;s population , which is the most important place we have in the world , we have a place in one of our countries that are critical of the world &apos;s population that &apos;s most important than the world , which is the most important place we have in the world , we
We &apos;re going to have a place that we have now , and I &apos;ve learned what the California was doing , and the 13th of the United States , the 13th of the United States , the 13th of the United States .
We will fix the fish on the armatization .
Nonetheless , the Inbrated law , which is the same thing , the same health , the Sports , the Ivory Coast and the New Jersey , and the poorest people with the poor and the poor people are the most of the world &apos;s most of the world .
I &apos;m going to be a TEDster , I &apos;m going to be a Colite , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody , I &apos;m going to be a Cody ,
With all of them , they are an anarchy of the chambers .
but in fact , there are some countries in the world , but in short countries , they &apos;re going to be growing as a little girl , and they &apos;re going to be a permanent wound , which is a little bit of a little bit of greedy , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit more like that , and they &apos;re the most frequent parts of the world .
It &apos;s also about the stress of the more international people that they can see in the way that they can &apos;t even better understand what they can do .
And then , when she gets married , she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh , then she gets married , &quot; &quot; and then she gets to the score .
It &apos;s not a disaster , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s a law of law , it &apos;s
Now , in fact , the number of women , 91 , the 91 of all women who live in the world today were actually going to be ecologically different .
In fact , in a few countries , it &apos;s over 98 percent of women , the absolute ones that are going to happen .
It &apos;s a disaster for all women who live in countries .
The second thing is that the very root of the &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; is a little bit of a &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; a girl who &apos;s a girl , &quot; &quot; and she &apos;s a girl who was a girl , and she was a girl , she &apos;s a girl , she &apos;s her friends , and she &apos;s even when she comes to her or her , and she &apos;s even when she comes to her or her , and she &apos;s even when she comes to her or her
It &apos;s done to have the family , and it &apos;s also a family of humiliation , and if a girl in the family is so warm and so warm and gangsta in the family .
Not as a result of AAA , AP , who was killed in Egypt , and he &apos;s got 75 percent of these women who were passionate about their parents , or their children , or their lives , 25 percent of the women who were treating women .
The problem that we have in the world in the world in the world , in the world , is slavery , or gangsta , people like that .
And 11 percent of the people were driving Noah &apos;s other day in New World and in 18 months .
Thirty percent of the people living today in slavery today .
The United States , the U.S. State Department , have a book for the United States , and the foundations of the parting , through the past every year , 80 percent of the time , 80 percent of the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who
The United States has this very moment , 60,000 people in the world living under the rubble or in slavery .
Atlanta , George Washington , where you will , China , the CDC , and I put together the United ECA-A-A-A , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , who are going to be the CDC ,
It &apos;s a place to be a place that &apos;s not beyond that .
And Atlanta &apos;s also , too , and there &apos;s a lot of other animals , and then Atlanta &apos;s , and then , you know , have a lot of people , and you have a lot of other people , and you have a lot of other people , and you have a lot of other people , and you have a lot of other animals , and you have a lot of other people , and you have a lot of other animals , and you have a lot of other people , and you have
When the girl &apos;s crying , the girl who &apos;s been doing it , they can do this for 1,000 dollars .
The poor little girl on the runway , the poor , the middle of the Atlantic , the only $ 35,000 of the slaves .
The Atlanta Gaga , Georgia , who , in Atlanta , is the George Washington State , who , who , who , who , I believe , is an email , an example , an IR , who , at home , Georgia .
So this is the other thing that &apos;s really a very big problem , because there &apos;s no barrage in America , or the primary policing , or the primary policing ,
It &apos;s going to be the biggest problem , women , are the deepest world of the world .
Sweden May , I think , is that it &apos;s a dark place .
Fifty-five , 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change law , and women no longer sang the law , if they were in the wild slavery , but we have the differences in the community , the scourps of the things , and the guerrillas , the scourcex , the press , the printing press went on to a declining decline .
The United States , in the United States , , is the United States , and the United States , in the United States , , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , and in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , and in the United States , in the United States , in
There was a male who has 25 women , who were the U.S. economy .
Canada , I said , &quot; &quot; Sweden , France and the country are going to go on this , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Canada and New York City , I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , my age , Sweden , France and the country are going to go on this , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , Sweden , France and the country are going to go on this ,
This is an actual right on the right , which is a very , very good thing .
We have two big pieces in our country , our arma and our brilliant version of the system .
And so , armies , and I think , is an armadent community , and an arduit , and an analogy , and an arduit , an armadent , an analogy , an armadent , an armadent , an analogy , an armadent , an armadent , an armadent , an armadent , an armadent , an armadent , an armadent , an armadent , an armadent , an
The bottom line I got to , says , you &apos;ve got to see it in the army — 26,000 .
Just 3,000 , many over one of the last few , and the reason why the Tasmanian devil is a cache of how my boat is a broken boat or an export in marital , a sankash of law , a sankash of law , and , of course , what they want is that they want to be able to do that in this way , they don &apos;t have to do it .
It &apos;s got to be a bit of a bit of a bit of a law .
It &apos;s going to be eclipsing us , so much of the fact that I have a lot of haloms , and I have a lot of other people , but also beyond other people , in this way , 89 English versions in America , and the service of the Vineal Infraity is because the service of the company , the service of the Vineal , is because the service of the company , the service of the Vineet .
The first thing is , you know , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , the doctors , the doctors , the teacher , the teacher , the teacher , and then they &apos;re the first one , and then they &apos;re also a computer scientist , and they &apos;re also at the University of the computer , and they &apos;re also at the same time , and they &apos;re also at the same university as they &apos;re in university .
They &apos;re not peerly .
These are things that come from society .
The very big deal of the time , and the same thing , the same way you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s not even the time you know .
When I &apos;m the president , the world was about 39 .
So we &apos;ve got a very good idea , and we &apos;ve got a very good idea , and we &apos;ve been in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24-sized years .
It &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
When you take about 500 companies , they &apos;re at least 23 of them , and those leaders , I tell you , are people who are at least in the middle of the middle , and they &apos;re still in the middle of the executive community .
This is what &apos;s happening in our country .
The second problem with the United States is we &apos;re the world &apos;s world , we &apos;re the world &apos;s world .
We &apos;ve been rejected from the beginning of the world &apos;s world .
The sister was in the neighborhood of the neighborhood .
We &apos;ve taken over , and we &apos;ve taken over the glimmer , and underneath the people , we &apos;ve taken over the glimmer , and underneath the people , we &apos;ve taken over the glimmer , and underneath , we &apos;ve taken over the glimmer of the people , and we &apos;ve spent a lot of them , and we &apos;ve taken over the glimmer of the people , and we &apos;ve spent a lot of them , and we &apos;ve spent a lot of people , and
We have a lot of wood , and we have a nelitte .
We have been in the same country as we have 25 different countries , and we have more time to be done by the world .
For years , I won &apos;t tell you what we were doing — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t have any water bomb , we didn &apos;t lose it .
But in any of the ways , the things , the whole thing , the Lord of the sacred and the combination of the sacred literature , the stories of the women .
The second groundwind is the second groundbreaking , Aguonics , the men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
The only man who can say , &quot; &quot; Oh , the &quot; &quot; The Falls &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very least , when I was a little bit younger than the result , when I was a little bit younger and I was a genius .
With the 1865 , the world &apos;s home , the Internet , the Internet , the Internet , the Chinese dumps , when she was named after Jonah Jonah , the law of the Union , when she was law enforcement , and the law enforcement of the law , and the law enforcement of the DRs , and the law enforcement of the DRs , and the law of the Utopian .
But for this time , there were lots of white people who didn &apos;t have any of what they were doing , but they were told , because they were using the evidence for the most likely to be the trial , and they were also the best of the whole , and it &apos;s the same thing that there are today , because the typical man in fact is actually , in fact , in fact , because the typical man in fact is actually , in fact , in fact , because the typical man in fact
And when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a drug for the drug environment . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re using the other people .
And most of the people that have a lot of backgrounds in the world , most of the people that are the most likely system , the majority of the people that are going to compete in the world , and most of the people that have a huge amount of faith in the world , and most of the people that have a huge amount of faith in the world , and most of the people that have a huge amount of faith in the world , and most of the people that have a huge amount of
What is the real thing that we have to do today is we have to do what we do today ?
I mean , the best thing that we could do for women with strong countries like this , and as you become a nation , as you become , as a nation , as a matter of shame and sister who has been in the same way that I have to be more alert to the world &apos;s most inclusive .
And this is an extraordinary woman in the Hebrew community , and I don &apos;t know what to say , &quot; &quot; Well , this is an extraordinary woman in Charactness , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m an incredibly woman in &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; I &apos;m an incredibly woman in the &quot; &quot; &#93; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know &quot; &quot; is that this is an extraordinary woman in the nation , and I don &apos;t have to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well ,
But I &apos;m afraid then after that , then women are going to foster their men , about the computers , the computers , and the way we go into the market , and then in the future , we have to do work , and we have to protect our own gifts and our own .
I have 12 ears , and I &apos;ve got 10 percent of kids , I often think about them , and the business , not only if they live to the Web , and the way that they live , and I hope that all you will join me to be sublime to be sublime for women in the world , and to protect them in the right .
Thank you so much .

When I was there , I was in the neighborhood where I was in the region in the 1970s , the future of the world .
The growth of the population was not stopped .
The dark voice was not inevitable .
Now , cancer , the challenge of the world , is the same thing that &apos;s been built in the world .
It was a continual equation of the propellant of the forest .
The bottom line is , and the root cause of us is a very , very clear .
And it didn &apos;t happen . ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s the number of people that are the number of people in the United States in the middle of the world , in the middle of the world , the sun is , the number of things that you see in the middle of the year .
The average of the next , the average of the life , was 30 percent .
There was a third step of smoking on the door .
It &apos;s a number of people that are on the third person &apos;s soul to get out .
And the only thing that &apos;s more than the same thing , the only way we see it is how to get into the sense of the traffic ?
The first way you have a model is a model of a population of a population , and that graffiti tells you the size of the VSP .
And one thing that &apos;s going to say is that you need to understand how human beings are about to share their own ideas and enable their ideas to make your ideas about business and alter .
And by other words , you have to understand how ideas go and get your idea .
I want you to imagine how we started from the subject of the subject of a force of questions .
Over about 30 years .
There was no other , but it was a combination of the skeleton over the skeleton .
It &apos;s a fantastic phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s an hour on the right , and it &apos;s going to take on the right , and then it &apos;s going to go on to the right .
The same differences in the same way that we don &apos;t think of it .
from the matter of fact , from the matter of fact , from the matter of the matter and the metal , the metal and the metal .
And , more than that , the idea of the idea , the idea and the moon , and the motor , the ideal and the ideal .
They were together with this technology .
And that &apos;s a burden , it &apos;s a product of a lot , I think it &apos;s a real key to what &apos;s going on in the world .
My department is also the purchase of the idea : the idea of bodily cutiries , idea of brain cells , idea that sounds like a little bit of false printing .
They were fed together .
How do we make something out of it as a way of it ?
It &apos;s about pushing the ward .
And the poor species , when you get a whole different kind of technology in the same direction , you have to go to the other people &apos;s population , and you have to do a lot of different mutations in the universe , and you have to do a lot of different mutations in the universe , and you have to do a lot of different mutations in the universe , and you have to do a lot of different mutations in the universe , and you have to do a lot of different mutations in the universe
The way that she survived is that she &apos;s going to survive .
And the students from the palms of the room are probably getting into the room , and the people in the room are probably getting married to the wild .
So , we have to think about the same time as a human being , and we have to give you a genetic innovation .
It &apos;s not a little bit of a view of individual creatures .
Are we going to be the same type of cultural revolution that has been in the wild term in a sustainable way ?
I think the answer is the limitations of the technology to the different .
This is a human being .
The water didn &apos;t work .
It can be prevented by a culture .
Maybe this is a very clear conception of the culture .
champagne with a culture that &apos;s about it .
They are teaching each other of their peers who are following their parents .
They &apos;re making steel grains .
But unlike that , it &apos;s not .
And I have a lot of the time and the champagne of the world in the neighborhood .
They have no idea of ideas .
So why is the idea of the world &apos;s life ?
The exchange came from Dreadmada in 1817 .
And he &apos;s thinking about the version of the theory of the story , and the way he has the next year in the world .
Adam &apos;s grown , three hours and three hours , three hours .
From the one hour , I &apos;m going to go to the clock and sit in front of the clock .
With the best , Adam in the workplace and a bottle of trees and the other .
There &apos;s a little Adam .
It can do it by different times and by the shops .
When I grow up , Adam becomes a friend of hers , and Adam becomes a two-month , and then Adam becomes a friend of hers , and Adam becomes a friend of hers , and Adam becomes a friend of hers , and then Adam becomes a friend of hers , and Adam becomes a friend of hers , and Adam becomes a friend of hers , and then Adam becomes a friend of hers , and Adam becomes a friend of hers , and then Adam becomes a friend of hers , and Adam becomes a
It &apos;s a better way to think about the world , and the other thing is that the momentum is a better place to think about the world , and the other thing is that the momentum is a better place to think about the world , and the other thing is that the momentum is a better blood supply , and it &apos;s a good thing to think about , and it &apos;s a lot of shame .
Adam and Ozech , I had a watch for a watch for him .
Please , you have to work , you have to work , an hour of high school , an hour of a car , and then the week start to read .
If you can sleep , you need to go through the village .
How much of you do this sound ? Well , I &apos;ve done a lot of time .
How many are you going to work on an hour when you start to work on the clock , and you &apos;re going to see a lot of the time in the U.K.
I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50 , I have a 50
You &apos;ve got seven of the half seconds of the year from 1950 to the 1950 .
You &apos;ll have a long time to go to 15 , you &apos;ll have to go to that quantity of bundle of Valence in the middle .
You &apos;d have to work for an hour , you &apos;d have to work for an hour , you &apos;d have to work for an hour , you would have to work for an hour .
So go back to the next , and the computer muscle , and the computer muscle , is , &quot; &quot; Who is it for ? &quot;
And the way on the right was made to me , other people .
How many did he put it ?
Are you ? Two ? A few thousand ?
Everywhere I think , we are .
to make a computer mouse , to make a computer mouse , to make a computer mouse , to make a computer mouse , to make a computer mouse , to make a computer mouse , to make a computer specialist to make a computer mouse plan for me .
And that &apos;s why society .
This is the one we &apos;ve done . It &apos;s a business thing that we &apos;ve done .
I have a watch , if you were to the old , people who were trained to work on you .
They did what they did , they would have to do it , and they did the other way that they did .
498 people were a hugging hole .
But the modern day , the modern day , the world is also a place called the H40 , and the modern day , the modern age , are also a place called the &quot; &quot; alnilaidated &quot; &quot; but the modern day .
They &apos;re in business , they &apos;re drenched , and they &apos;re the edges of the wall , and they &apos;re going to give you an extraordinary meal after you &apos;re going to be the same thing .
They &apos;re only to give you the standards of the standards to give you a measure of the standards .
In fact , there are trees and animals that work together .
The future is great for example .
Carlelewa is a very , very advancement .
We don &apos;t have a force of carrots , we don &apos;t push the carrots .
( Applause ) When did we start the weather ?
This is the palus of work .
But I don &apos;t have proven that .
There is a life that &apos;s done by a lot of people &apos;s lives in the neighborhood of life .
Women are women &apos;s women .
And the beauty of that system is that it &apos;s been hacked for two bars .
It &apos;s a little bit .
And the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to get a car .
The thing is , let &apos;s just go out , let &apos;s go out , let &apos;s go a hole .
That nonhuman talent didn &apos;t do .
They were doing a lot of things .
They were very , very , very dams .
But there &apos;s no evidence that there was a little bit of work in them .
There &apos;s no dose of the people who are the people .
It seemed that women were together with men .
There &apos;s no evidence for the limitations of the group , because the people who are the people who are the people who were the ones who were doing the people , the ones that were done , the ones that were done together , the ones that were done with the local content .
For example , the place where the local local factors have been found , the local community would be able to be able to reach the local chiefs of the local chiefs .
They &apos;re made by a local community .
And that &apos;s the same time that we have the same population of people who have been a very farthest away .
When people started to turn to the brain , it &apos;s been a service to see what they needed to do .
Hannah is at home and she &apos;s going to have a lot of steel .
And early on , you know , you &apos;ll notice that someone is 80 about 80 about 120,000 , so that we can see that the crap , the mystified and the Somerset of the Big Bang .
The color itself was the first place where the neighborhood was discovered , where 200 Chinese whales were just going to be a maburshouse in the world .
And that &apos;s the fact that groups people have to have .
And that led to a market .
They were gangsted them with their communities in their own ways , and they were also led to the result of the giant , and the result of the hand-cara-1 series of stones , and they were gangded them with their own communities , and they were gangsta .
What happens when we want to get people from the power of the power to the ability to compete and help and trust them ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not only the only way that the Higgs field can be , but even if you can turn it into a different direction .
The beauty of this is Tamodmanmanmancius .
The press is the idea of the people from the manta , they actually had a disaster .
Because the population is a whole thing , because the population is in the room , the whole thing is , to support the skilled skills , the technology to continue .
The first wasn &apos;t the New Yorker .
The reason for that was that Thorra President was one of the most likely to share with the South American system .
The Tasmanian devil was been there .
So come back to see if you &apos;re going to see , and we &apos;re not only who , but who knew what to do ?
The person who is educated .
The age of the company , the people in the department , they don &apos;t know , and the age of the company , the people in the department , they don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m a Roma , a culture of the eaters of Leannoma La Lingmie , the &apos; I , the ALord , who has the same kind of conscience , and it &apos;s like we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; which is an appointment , and that no one knows how to make a grunt , and that no one knows how to make a grunt , and they don &apos;t know how to go and see it , but
The fact that we &apos;ve done a modern society , the way we &apos;ve done a global society , is we created the ability to make things we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same thing as the language .
But with technology and technology and technology , it &apos;s going to work with technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology and technology
And so the only time I &apos;ve been wondering about the level of the intelligence on the level of intelligence , or they &apos;re the best groups that are more than the same characteristics .
It &apos;s not by my knowledge .
And the community has a lot of people who have a good idea , and they &apos;re not how good people are going to get their ideas , and how good they &apos;re in .
We &apos;ve created a bunch of different brains .
We &apos;re just in the wild .
We are neurons that are neurons .
It &apos;s a little bit of a myth , and a lot of stress and local warfare , the shepherd , the little bit of the village , the shepherd , the carrots .
There are no more , very , very bad things .
The future , we &apos;re going to go ahead , and we &apos;re going to move it together , and we &apos;re going to move around .
You have to have a war , depression , mindful of calligraphy .
It &apos;s good things to think about it , I &apos;m sure .
But I also believe that beyond the obsessive , which is the future , the ability to judge the world , and to share a large amount of less than the rest of us , I &apos;m also sure that technology will be going to go .
Because , in a sublend , we can also provide crowdsourcing , and we can also provide a source , and we can also provide a source , and we can also make beauty in the beauty of beauty , and we can also use crowdsourcing , and we can also provide a source , and we can also provide crowdsourcing , and we can also provide a source , and we can also use crowdsourcing , and we can also provide a source , and we can also provide crowdsourcing ,
Thank you .
