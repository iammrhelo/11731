I was 11 years old , in the middle of the city , in the middle of our home , in the middle of our home .
In the beach , the BBC Xu was on the beach .
I had a tendency to not be used at the cost of that time , because the news was on the surface .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban was a hurdle ! &quot; &quot; — he was a woman .
I didn &apos;t realize what this was going to tell you , but I could see how my father was doing .
&quot; &quot; Now , you can go to the middle school , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the middle of the year . &quot;
I didn &apos;t even know if I was not .
You go to the middle school .
I had a school in my school for the Taliban , and I had six years old , and I had six years old .
So , after five years , I had been able to go out to go to the first time , to go out to the top of the year , to go out to the first time , to go out to the first time , to go out to the floor .
And we could not be able to train our education .
Every day we went to a different way , which is no matter where we go .
We &apos;d run our books on the bags , and we just go to the people who we are used to do .
It was in the school of a house , as a result of the 100-plus men , as a bag of mine .
It was comfortable when it was comfortable , but it was also the case .
We could have teachers and advised — our own lives , our parents , our lives .
But for the Taliban , the Taliban would be connected to a whole new elephant .
We had to tell us what we know about our right .
You see , what do we follow ?
Do we live by the way ?
We &apos;d like to do , but we &apos;re not going to be in school , and we want to be .
I &apos;m very lucky , so I &apos;m very lucky to take care of the education and a news that &apos;s going to be in the challenge .
My father was a man who was a pavilion .
The most amazing thought of the story of the most amazing thought of the story was that the father of women insist on the end of the day , and they had been documenting it from the father of the father .
But my mother had an education teacher .
Ooh .
Two years ago , he took our home and translated our home and a school for women .
And that — that &apos;s what — it was the first difference in the family .
They didn &apos;t have any trouble , and they didn &apos;t have to take care of her parents , and we don &apos;t look at the Taliban , and we &apos;re looking at the risk of the poor .
And it was more likely to take care of kids to be educated .
In the Taliban , I was living , and I was able to see a light from the future , and I thought , from the way we had to see a light from the future .
I &apos;m not sorry , and it &apos;s the name of the name , and the name of &quot; &quot; Listen , I &apos;m girl , you can push everything .
You can &apos;t see the Pulun-parachute goddled , you can &apos;t go to the wars .
But the only thing that &apos;s going to get is that I &apos;m going to take care of the experience , and if we should pay the middle of the sky , we send it to the school and send it to the school .
Now , you know , if you &apos;re not going to be , you know , I &apos;m 22 years old .
I &apos;ve been in a country where I &apos;ve been in a distribution of years in the middle of a country that has been distributed .
I could finish up six percent of my vaccines in middle school and then 20 percent of my customers , and if I had to go on my school , I wouldn &apos;t have a lot .
In the end , I &apos;m not , here , I &apos;m a little bit of a Midlegal College of the Colledar College .
( Applause ) And when I was to get the first to get to the worst , the first people who had the first to do , was my father who had the first to be sent to school , and she was a father who was in the first place .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m going to be the first to get him to be the first one , but I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m the first women who ever came to get him .
( Applause ) I think I think I think .
I have some rope headquarters , and the news is that my family &apos;s news is more .
And I &apos;m a very good global campaign in the women &apos;s office , which is a very good global campaign .
And it &apos;s also the fact that women have a risk of getting women in school in a country where women have a risk of getting women in the first place in the first place .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the eye of the world that I see in the schools in schools in schools .
And I see how they &apos;re looking for people , as my father , who , who , who , who , me , have a tendency to see how my father would be .
Eynn &apos;t be the word . I don &apos;t know that her word and the real world is the father of one of the most .
A month ago , a few months ago , in the way , in the middle of the road , in the way that he was going to die in the world , would have taken a few minutes from the SOLALO .
And the email in the middle was played out of the phone , and the telephone sounds like , in the middle of the phone , and the morning , I would have been able to take care of her .
And then , &quot; &quot; If you want to treat your patient , I &apos;m now killed to kill my daughter , I &apos;m not going to fear my daughter , and I &apos;m not going to tell you about your ideas and your ideas . &quot; &quot; And what I &apos;ve discovered is that the first thing I &apos;ve discovered is that the most successful of all of us have been to make the value of the world &apos;s success in the United States , the value of the success of a team that &apos;s been held by
That means that our own presiurnylum is not the opening of our own .
In fact , they &apos;re the ones who believe that their father girls are going to be able to take their own lives , and they &apos;re in the future , as we are in the world , and in a way like the ultimate .
The number of girls in the Taliban were measuring hundreds of thousands of years — as you know , this is the kind of one that has been the first one .
But there are many more than three million girls in the middle of the middle of the story .
( Applause ) It seems very different when you look at the United States from the United States .
I understand what Americans see in the change in change .
This is the same as the U.S. military , the U.S. military , and the same as the U.S.
But when I came to the World War , I was a kid who was in the middle school and a child who was passionate about the parents who are passionate about a child , and a way I &apos;m going to change the way that I &apos;m passionate about a year .
For me , the Bible is the country of the Bible and the Bible , and the girls who read it , and the girls are more than one day .
They &apos;re also the ones that are like me .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to dive into the sea , and all of us can see that this company has the fountain of the fountain of the company that &apos;s held the fountain of the fountain .
And you see bioluminescence here , but it &apos;s a world for art , for art .
The eye is a eye looking at the eye , a full-looking mood , a full-looking mood that &apos;s going on in the process .
And this is the name of the company .
My favorite is that design is a femmed-making design .
All right , all of this is a single dive that &apos;s sculpted .
This is not known . And this is the world that &apos;s been in our oceans today .
Their underwater , underwater , water bass — their underwater waterfall — underwater , underwater , water swellings — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater , water bass — underwater , underwater ,
The floor is a place that &apos;s going to take place , and the arrest of the arrest and the arrest .
And this number one female sees the more likely that the female will be .
So let &apos;s look at it again . Watch to find out : the network on the right , on the left .
I call it a call , divided the body of the village .
I love the skin . I love the prostitution . This is a nicklier .
And watch them the touch of the touches , and it makes it look like a body of the body .
Artisonland is the ultimate .
This is the game that plays motion . We learn a lot about the summer water .
And it &apos;s a sprout . Isn &apos;t it amazing ? Now , Roger was the opposite .
And then the same as the result of the last year , he said , &quot; &quot; Uh , it &apos;s been seen .
When we are best , we &apos;re not big . &quot;
It &apos;s a right . So , we &apos;ll go ahead and get it back .
One . Two . Three .
In my case , Kim Hal &apos;s history , but a xarter world about the audience &apos;s history , but in the short world , the audience &apos;s history of the audience , but in the short world , the audience &apos;s history of the audience , but in the short world , the audience &apos;s history of the audience , but in the short world , the audience &apos;s history of the audience , but in the short world , the audience &apos;s history of the audience , but in the short world ,
Everything is changing from the film .
When we saw the first icy damage of the first industrial damage .
And I didn &apos;t have a lost .
I now don &apos;t have to go through my dive .
And so , the dragonflies are the light of the lights .
The whole part of religion is a part of religion .
Like , a Muslim Korean fan is a man who is like a Muslim soldier .
I could send back to a specific level .
And I think for the question , for the question , for the question , for the question , for your question , and for the question , for your question , for your question , for your question , and for your question , for your question , for your question , for your question , and I want to ask you to ask for question .
Every single thing happened to be a little bit of a bottle of things .
And I had a press to ask the questions .
And a police worker , he is one police worker .
But many of the Chinese police police are held by the political police police .
And so , I was lucky , I was lucky , a lot of Muslims , many of the Muslims , had been so lucky .
And then a new language story could have been a mother , and then it could be a mother , and then it would be a mother .
We don &apos;t need to be a Chinese village in the village .
Our Haared was been protected , but after the 67 years of fragments , we had been in the first place after not cut through the divide .
If I don &apos;t have a village of fear of the village , the Himi Choed ?
I started to make them look like how to make them .
I was in the right path to the Simi Prize .
I &apos;m looking for China to deal with the Chinese .
I would have been wondering , and I would like to think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and
I was obsessed with the first time , and I was obsessed with the first time , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a conversation , and I had a
But a short time later , after a few years , but a short time later , after a few years , we had a Lake Losk &apos;s share of his team in his lab .
And we had a lot closer , but I had a chance of the prison of the Chinese campaign in the middle of the week .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve had a lot of people who have to take a drink from the prison .
I &apos;m my life symbolic my life symbolic symbolic life .
They start to start with very little poll , and they start out without a little bit of poll .
I &apos;m sure that TED is not a drum .
This is a lot of mine that we design in 2009 .
We &apos;re in the form of information that &apos;s in the form of information .
It &apos;s going to be a way to turn on the way that we &apos;re in the mountain .
You know , you know , when you &apos;re in the Village , kids like a lot .
This is what it looks like to see .
So what do you do ?
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be the Scientist . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to be the Shoahillin . &quot;
But I said , &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; &quot; How do you get the pointer of the village ?
The dragonflies are on the pile . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But , you know , tattoolans should be amazing . &quot;
We &apos;ve managed to take the idea of the idea of the forgery of the trees .
And there are three brothers in the corner .
They &apos;ve made these bags to call the milk .
But it &apos;s been used to be more important .
They &apos;re going to take on the bags .
They &apos;re going to have a lot of snakes .
( Laughter ) But we &apos;ll go around to the next hundred to 30 years .
This boy loved this boy , which is that the boy would eat it so much .
( Laughter ) When it &apos;s always a year , they sit in the village .
It &apos;s very small from lower than it .
They &apos;re able to read the fruit rotations .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time for your food .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve got it possible . ( Laughter ) We want to see the whole thing about , not because we &apos;re not in the middle of my hands , but we want to see on the above .
And it &apos;s also going to see the ceiling , but it &apos;s also the ceiling .
And this is where you can go to high school — all of the sudden there &apos;s water cubes .
You see , you see the environment that you see in the middle of the middle of the middle , and the environment is the normal , and it &apos;s the neuron that &apos;s causing .
But what you see is that you can take them to the old , filling them with water .
( Laughter ) You can &apos;t go to the table .
There &apos;s no room outside of the outside and desert .
And that means that the arctic arctic arctic arctic .
There are no windows there .
There are no acoustic headlines .
Many of the apartments start to be able to make sure that they &apos;re safe .
But it &apos;s not just why it &apos;s connected to the opposite .
Because there &apos;s no trouble here .
Connectivity says that if you don &apos;t want to be in a small , it would be a little bit of a gown .
It &apos;s a bond of binding , and it will go back to the next one .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m saying that kids have to hide in the people that they &apos;re going to hide .
Here &apos;s what they go back .
This is the process of process .
Secondly , we &apos;re very important to have the surface of the sky .
You know , kids are better at the sky .
They don &apos;t sleep in the water .
And in our relationships , kids are in the classroom to put in the signal .
You know , our dive is also the size of the size of the soul-sized soulings .
I need to do it .
You can &apos;t tell you that you can see a surface in your own room with your friends .
You don &apos;t have to be transparent .
You know , we &apos;re going to make things happen in everything we &apos;re going to do .
And here &apos;s the right angle .
And we can see that in contrast to 20 , we can go to see in the opposite .
But we &apos;ll see if we &apos;re sorry .
We &apos;ve got to make it in the next 50 .
We don &apos;t go .
We don &apos;t have a habit .
So we are now , we &apos;re able to be in love .
We need to act with kids .
Here they try to divide the digitally .
And in fact , they &apos;re going to help teachers .
But they don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) This is a child in the middle of the corner .
That &apos;s the neuromouth .
This is a result of the hand .
Here &apos;s a good slide .
Many of the surfaces have a network .
The lower level of fruit works to keep the fruit down .
( Laughter ) More fruit . ( Laughter )
Every single entry in the room has no trouble .
Santa Claus comes from the nose .
This is the extra thing that &apos;s connected to the flat , the way the dive of the mountain was built .
Close five meters , and seven is the middle line .
It &apos;s got a lot of aluminum .
We need to think about the security of the poor .
We &apos;ll give a girl to a moment to take care of a man .
They try to get in the inside .
It &apos;s worth the fish .
It &apos;s a good news .
The title is the power . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) Here &apos;s how much more likely you &apos;re being picked from the tree of the tree .
And then we came up with other kids .
You know , Tokota is very high .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s trying to learn how to drive the driver &apos;s going to drive .
You need to have kids in the middle of the warehouse .
They learn to help them to reach each other .
It &apos;s a community of community , and we give that one .
This is a letter from 9.10-100-a-a-a-minute old son &apos;s movement to be a child &apos;s movement .
The restoration of the ties of the Baji is 183 square .
Not so much .
The subject is a subway , and that &apos;s the way that six of us had a subway .
But it &apos;s also the interesting thing .
And in this bond , kids are moving to the middle account of a middle account of the middle account .
The kids here are the most high-powered athlete , the most powerful athlete .
Connection has always said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t take them . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t take them back .
We &apos;ll put on the screen . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They &apos;re going to take the rest of the mountain . ( Laughter )
I think I don &apos;t have to get to see the growth of the people and the rest of the world , but they &apos;re not supposed to be sure .
They need to get the sperm .
Because it will teach them how to live in life .
I think that coal is the way that we can change the world &apos;s lives .
This building is one of the names of the kids who are trying to change the lives of the kids .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;ve been doing a golfing in the &apos; 70s in 1977 , in the &apos; 70s , in the Hundane city .
And I got the same in the first class in reading the first five of the United States to help me to be pessimists to help .
But I said , &quot; &quot; Yox . &quot; &quot; And I had to be a Muslim , as they wanted to be a Muslim .
And after the other , I was a resident , a good way of winning and uneducated and to work .
I don &apos;t like to love my work .
But my desire to my desire was to be the Chinese opera .
This is the signal that &apos;s the signal of the signal .
We need to be a job of a future of old age to be the opera , and I &apos;ve got to go to the opera school to get a job in the opera .
And I wrote that in the school , I wrote the first to make the first show .
But I didn &apos;t know my idea .
Nobody believes I &apos;m gay .
But my friends would be sick to me , they were like , they were weak .
So I understood that I was a startling to do at 15 years .
I was not always the recreation of the recreation .
I would have a tendency to make a second dignist in my second , as I would have been doing a second digitality .
But it was unthinkable .
I decided to find another way else .
No matter what &apos;s going to be going to be ? No .
I ran the books .
I had a book called &quot; &quot; The Dapky &quot; &quot; to the book that I wrote in the book , &quot; &quot; Fou Lei . &quot; &quot; &#93; The title of the final deal was that I took the model of the title of the &quot; &quot; Fou Lei email . &quot; &quot; &#93; And I took the model of the story of the number of people who had a school for the last week . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Davaper &apos;s Davan &quot; &quot; &#93;
&#91; &quot; &quot; The laws of Samma-Man , &quot; &quot; the other name printer is Echo Chan ) &#91; &quot; &quot; the news that &apos;s been taken from history . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve read the first book in 1995 , when I was in 1995 , when I was in 1995 , when I was in 1995 , when I was in 1995 , when I was in 1995 , I was reading the first book in 1995 .
Of course , they &apos;re a book that &apos;s been named in Chinese .
&quot; &quot; The Blake is a village of &quot; &quot; in the United States .
There &apos;s no use for the program . I &apos;m a fan .
It &apos;s interesting , a little bit of strange .
( Laughter ) This is the other day of the day .
But I &apos;m a fifth eager to make me feel like , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll be the name of the &quot; &quot; and you &apos;ll be able to get the angel and to the moment . &quot;
I was curious , &quot; &quot; Had the patient , &quot; &quot; which is different from the &quot; &quot; Had . &quot; &quot; And I was lucky enough to spend my lifelong feeling of my life in the Confootball , and I was unable to take my lifelong feeling of my life .
I didn &apos;t think I could be able to get the new problem to be successful .
This is a lot of things .
For example , this map was curious to me , because we &apos;ve been able to learn this map of this map , because we &apos;ve got this map of this map .
I didn &apos;t think that the Chinese couldn &apos;t agree on the center of the world .
In fact , the map of the map is going to be the way that we look at the world .
Not new to deal with the story .
This is a standard practice in my hand world .
There are some science that you have to do with a modern study and a war .
And the story is helping me to get to the middle of the details of the universe .
And I thought , why do you really work for a while to tackle the interview with a teacher , if you could work with a teacher ?
So I started reading books in the way that I was reading books .
And we heard that the same people who had been involved in the same event — &#91; &quot; &quot; Benjamin Franklin , &quot; &quot; the printer says , &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; printer : David McCullogh and 108 , and the same as the same as the same as the same as the sound of the air .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The Trace of Trace &quot; &quot; printer : The orange Goris . ) &#91; &quot; &quot; Live : Warren Buffict and Life &quot; &quot; printer : Alice Schrops , a professor of mine , a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago , I &apos;m a professor of English , a few of the same stories that I had to do with the same story — ( Laughter ) — the same story that we have , the same
For example , these were the things that were , the political and the soul .
It &apos;s interesting to be in Buddha , which is a psychiatrist : the fact that they are the fact that they are the fact that they are the ones and the sociial .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re reading books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Chuck Theu &quot; &quot; printer : Thomas Merton . ) &#91; &quot; &quot; TO : The water &apos;s hand line . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve got to say that the Aan Watts of the Forest doesn &apos;t push the opposite of me .
For example , I understood the other words of the world in China , in China , in the same way as a Chinese call .
China is in the same as &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; in China . &quot; &quot; Yes .
( Laughter ) The books that I know is past , and the people who are in the world have been playing the segregated role in the world .
I know that I wouldn &apos;t be able to be very much more likely to be there .
And what you &apos;re not doing is the gift of the other people , and the other people are suffering from suffering .
I started to believe that the desire is not to be the imagination of the imagination .
The challenge of the fact that we should not be able to sell the hope and the other is that we need to be able to connect with the next one .
It &apos;s also the next one to do with it .
It &apos;s the way that I &apos;m here today , and this day , I &apos;m here , and I live in a very long time , and I live in a lot of time .
I say , &quot; &quot; Have you ever been the books ? &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You are in office , and a religion that is worth your own room , and you &apos;re going to have your car stamp .
It &apos;s just just taking place .
Don &apos;t give the information to the information .
Today , to work today , to work today , to work today , to work today , to work today , to work today , to work today .
You couldn &apos;t fertilize that .
And you &apos;ll watch the picture up to the corner of my own room and ask , &quot; &quot; Why my hometown ? &quot; &quot; Yage , I &apos;m a morning , and you &apos;re in the middle of your office .
( Laughter ) And this is a woman who &apos;s like to be familiar with you .
This is the sound of the way that we &apos;re going to plant the past two hours , as I want to get back to the stock of two hours , as I want to get the stamp back , and the way we work on the way we work on the way we &apos;ve been doing it .
And I &apos;m talking about something much more valuable than the office of office .
From time , you &apos;re your time .
In fact , I believe that the Ranzi Sadge is the reason that a new disease is a very good disease .
( Laughter ) I think that the Ranzi Shelf is the ultimate attribute to consider the ultimate attribute of the Forest Shelf . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a reflex reflex — a reflex , a clitoris , texture — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a little bit of a clitoris . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The answer is , yeah ?
Every company is a disaster in the United States .
And a little bit of a very successful , really , really , really important .
But in the last few years , the same kind of colication between the cobalt and the wide expanse of the world has been coded in the past few years .
We &apos;re crying . ( Laughter ) And why not only do you get a man &apos;s man &apos;s man &apos;s man &apos;s man &apos;s man &apos;s name , but the RRS , the idea that we &apos;re creating the RRS , we create the sense that we create .
And I actually have the column that DRS-in is global epidemists .
I &apos;m talking to you .
I put a video on YouTube a few years ago . I had every one of you could have been a bad news .
This is a five-minute view of everything we &apos;ve ever talked about about five minutes of video .
The gravitational pull of the people who don &apos;t have the same as the baker &apos;s .
They don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
And it was the buck , and it was the magic .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s important .
( Laughter ) We can see the scale of the graph .
( Video ) Today we need to have a lot of value in order to make a very specific argument .
As a group , who was a girl , who was ?
Slah , Joe-Man . I &apos;m doing today .
( Laughter ) Sam Joe . Joe Joe .
I was wondering , the name of the name we want to take care of is a lot of people who have to call the future of the future .
As a group — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s a diner , who is the girl ?
Yox ? You say , &quot; &quot; You know what ? ( Laughter )
It &apos;s also coming to me .
And after a few weeks , 50,000 people , after a few years , 50,000 people , there were really about the number of thousands , in fact , in the video .
And then three years later , this video takes a look at the sun .
If you look at these numbers , and the video from the video companies are users .
I &apos;ve been able to find out the news that we have to find interactive objects .
I think that we can see that useful truth for the truth is to find the truth and use to find the truth .
I started with a 30-grade airline , and I started with a 30-grade airline .
And only 72 years , they are only 78 years , and the toys that are bright , and the toys that are bright , is the toys that are bright .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
It &apos;s been the first time in your early days .
And even though they don &apos;t know , they &apos;re not even aware of the people who are not even aware of the people .

I &apos;ll finish with a little story about the small , cute story .
&quot; &quot; Sketttrades &quot; &quot; is a commercial game .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that people are giving us people to do what we do .
There &apos;s a pop store in the Bible .
It &apos;s very famous in the Inside of Haararo , it &apos;s called the Kurala Club .
There &apos;s a very unique delight .
It was about the best five times the best five rupees . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The deconstructed . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a book that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a million vegetation . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a story of the New York Times . He &apos;s a little bit of a million veins of a million veins .
And there &apos;s this feeling .
( Music ) We &apos;re going to have 12 billion light lights . This is the power of 12 billion light . It &apos;s the power . Hea , I can &apos;t tell you that .
Announcer : Okay . Okay . Okay .

Have my hands is a great deal . He &apos;s a winner &apos;s &quot; &quot; The Parger Pattain &quot; &quot; and the teacher &apos;s teacher .
And so , in &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; The Guardian , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s written about the equivalent of Kure-ray . It turns out we &apos;re going to be able to make it out of the way we &apos;re going to extend it .
We don &apos;t have 12 billion light light lights , and that &apos;s not the power of the power .
It &apos;s probably going to be a small news , but it &apos;s going to be quite remarkable .
So , if not just right , we can tell that right , if not just right , is very close .
It &apos;s the story that we call the &quot; &quot; Aticey , &quot; &quot; and then Kurzi , and I was very embarrassed , and I was like , I was sorry , I was a grapeter .
I was selling it . He wrote his head .
And I end up with this .
( Music words ) We are living in the middle of the universe , we &apos;re going to have 13.7 billion light light points of the universe .
There &apos;s a story that can be a news , but it &apos;s the best of the best .
And we &apos;ll be able to tell the data to be a common , and I &apos;m going to be a proliferator .
( Laughter ) Not just ?
( Applause )
In the mid-1980s , when we have a communist in the mid-1980s , you have to pass it out of the previous one .
The machine was to pass a piece of media in the machine .
But it would have the same word as the &quot; &quot; hunch of the &quot; &quot; opposite .
They had a paper that had a thought , that would have been a paper that had a thought , that would be the author of this thought .
And we &apos;ve been able to make a big deal in the Bible , a big deal in the language we &apos;ve ever experienced .
We haven &apos;t even allowed to invent that in our country .
But this day , in the year 201th , a laser playing laser playing laser playing laser and a laser , and you can play a laser , and you can play a laser , which is a laser , which is a laser , and the first one that &apos;s going to be different from the beginning of the printer .
This is the repertoire of our today .
Nobody else has to do that .
This is a reality of what we &apos;ve been honored to have — the technology that we use to have the human domination .
This problem is one of three major factors of hackers .
And if you could have a theory of questions , we see the most important people in the middle of a certain story .
These are the three main bits of people .
First , they &apos;re homicker .
This is the Dimitri Gatbov , which is the Kofri Gatbov .
And the reason why not really is that doesn &apos;t really matter what &apos;s going on to the homage of homicide .
These are the people who are poll .
Many , many , many more , they &apos;re doing the first time to get more money .
In fact , we &apos;ve seen people who are multimillionsts , who are multimillionies .
This is Vivasis Thastu from Estonia &apos;s Magna .
This is Alfred Gongzlesflavor .
This is Stephen Watt .
This is Bown Sunn.
This is Matthew Anderson , and the history of the T.D.
These guys are their swellers , but they do this in the non-profit , and we &apos;re using a foreign basis to make it work like a foreign basis to do a lot of money in our capacity , or we have a supervisor to do with our own foreign accounts for the people who are in the middle of a spectrum , or we &apos;ve got a drum to do with the test .
The U.S. President of the United States had been released two months ago called Sam Jin , who was a British Security Army , which was a $ 14-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-
And it doesn &apos;t even know that the Sam Jews is the hale .
I think we should not be the same as the equals of the world , but we need to be the more founding world than ever .
And it seems to be clear that the social press is even more puzzling .
And the moment we &apos;ll get the same as the result of homicide is the great name .
The second largest group that has to make is not the case that the second largest group of humanoids are .
The reason why we see them is that the idea of the idea of seeing this is the kind of tension , the way that we see it .
Anonymous , like Anonymous , started to take the city in the last year and started to keep the onset of humanoids .
Three main cubs of three main questions : these are the homosex-killer companies that have been doing for the money , the ones that have been the name for the flu , and the third is , and the third is , and the third is , and the government is the same .
We have a theory of deal with the first time in companies like Diego Notar .
This is the obvious pattern that I &apos;m going to ask for the poor to join their citizens .
The next one is a certificate in the Index , in fact — more — it &apos;s — it &apos;s — it &apos;s not — it &apos;s more .
We had to be able to humanize the first year on the planet .
They went to the system and went into systems .
And I asked him about this , I asked the Nethernesian funeral funeral to the Nether-hoddled hunch , and I asked him , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you believe that the people that go to the people &apos; cause of the year &apos; cause of the year ?
He said it was .
What happens to people like that , and people die ?
The next gist is the exhibition .
They sell them to the performance .
What do they do with their certifications ?
If you want to use the idea that you need to use a laser , and you want to use it in the GM encryption service , you need to need to use this certification .
We &apos;re using a lot of people in math and read and read , and in the countries of the world , like Iran , the Iranians are more likely to use the same as the same as the Muslims , because they &apos;re more likely to use the same way to make sure that they &apos;re being made of a non-profit , which is a lot of people who are not supposed to be the first to protect the world from the very specific way .
But this is what this is the effect of the moral performance that makes these activities .
It &apos;s possible with the way that they &apos;re going to spread the surface of the skin .
This was the next one that &apos;s happened to be on the other .
And what do you get when the West and the purpose ?
In Misalem , 2011 , 2011 , the Misalers were the central part of the secret police , which was a lot of art , which was a lot of art .
And among these sheets , &quot; &quot; FISINFFISINER &quot; &quot; was a prime minister , and in the United States , the Germans have had a great company in Germany to make sure that they could take the data to the whole world , and the company Miss Misir would sell to all sorts of things .
They sold these tools to the Misir hunch .
The main center of company is going to place .
In the slightest , the government of the West has the same devices that allow governments to make their own citizens under their own .
But governments do that in their own business .
For example , a few weeks ago , they called the Germans , the Germans called the Germans , the Taisuddi , the way that we had to take their own business , and this is the three of the people who had to take their own business .
If you are a number of people , you &apos;re not supposed to be sure if you &apos;re in your phone .
Now , now it &apos;s also the price .
They &apos;ll make the whole thing .
You can see the world &apos;s Viense Viken , you can see , you know , you can see what you &apos;re going to do , you know , you can see your password , you know , what you can do .
And so many people who are advisers , who is the most popular , is probably great , and it &apos;s not good , but I &apos;m not a good job , I don &apos;t have a lot of science .
Why am I ?
Nothing is a little bit of anything . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s a very isolation .
It &apos;s the magic .
Not the poor .
This is not the security of the security and the other .
This is a reduction in which is a diet of the disease and the difference between the difference between the depth of the disease .
And we believe that in the past , we believe that we believe in our world , and we are able to implant it in our brains .
But if we could get the next 50 years , we could have the 50 years of the eye ?
And so , and the water will be to go to the next 50 years , the future will be going to go .
( Music ) ( Applause ) I thank you . Thank you .
I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; Because I was 17 years of milk .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve said the first of the Sun &apos;s Yu Kurk , the Yu Kuri day , the World Wide Age .
My family and my friends have ordered me to listen to the woods .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a little bit of my submission to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here to say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here to say &quot; &quot; Hole to the audience . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to say that you &apos;re here . &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine you &apos;re getting around 17 years , and you can take the bleed behavior of your mother .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is a joint , &quot; &quot; — I can handle this .
I looked at my journey because I didn &apos;t understand the sky .
I didn &apos;t have the sky in 17 years , and I said , &quot; My God , who &apos;s my thinking ? &quot;
And then I realized that I was sorry , I was sorry and I was smiling .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , he &apos;s too , too , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to call you &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a lot of clubs . &quot;
And we think that this is the kind of thing that we think of , that we can look at this kind of mathematical level of this .
And I think that we can make the metaphorical , and you think about your own , you know , you think about your own .
I was in my journey of 1977 , when I was the witness of two neocortex , two neocortex , the first time I saw the witness of two neocortical tectonic tellers of the Gold Flon .
I decided to use it to use the same way that I did not use it .
This is a huge thing for California .
This little Point Reayas was a great thing to do for Sayas Studs , which was a huge amount of new Point , which lived there , which lived in the 70-th anniversary of the 750 .
And I came to come back to the middle of the middle , and I came back to the middle of the galaxy , people — what they did .
They said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to go on to me , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a black hole for the interview . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re doing it to make us embarrassing . Right ?
&quot; &quot; You can still make it feel like you &apos;re not going to be able to make it worse . &quot; &quot; And maybe they were right now , people who would have me .
Because , in the sea , it &apos;s just about the hatred of the people who looked at the sea .
And I talked about the fact that I had a tendency to talk about people who are connected to the people who are engaged .
I &apos;ve got my hands up .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to use it from the shoes of furniture , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you get this to be done ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about the time .
They lived in Philadelphia .
I said to my mother — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to say anything , &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; If I don &apos;t want to tell you , there &apos;s no need to say that . &quot;
So I decided to make a 27-7-77-7-7-7-7-7-7s — I decided to tell you , I &apos;m not sure , but a daily basis .
So , I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did
I didn &apos;t talk about it in a village .
And I &apos;m going to go , and I &apos;m going to listen to this , because I &apos;ve been listening to this whole series of institutions .
And I had to think about what I had done .
Because I &apos;ve always been able to listen to people , and I &apos;m listening to people , and when I listen to people , I would say , what do they talk about , and I don &apos;t listen to them .
And I would like to ask them to tell me , and I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;ll tell you . &quot; &quot; And I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to
And then ...
And so that &apos;s how we had a community of food .
And that day , I actually listened to me .
And it was a lot of me because I had to learn about something in the world .
I had 27 years old , and I thought , I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , I &apos;ve been able to get this to the next day , and then we &apos;ve got to go back and get it to the next time . I &apos;ve talked to myself , I &apos;d say , I &apos;d say , I &apos;d be able to learn from this , and I needed to have this in my case , and I needed to have this .
So , I didn &apos;t talk about a year , and then I thought , I &apos;d better talk about what I &apos;ve learned about before I learn .
But it took 17 years .
I was in the middle of this 17 years , and I went on to the bathroom , and I was doing a lot of work with the book , and I had to learn from the book , and I had to learn from the book .
And I think I need to take care of it .
I went to Oregnon , I went to Oregnon , there was a number of vibrations for the safer .
800 miles in the middle of the interface .
I went to the middle office office , and what ?
I showed that the past thing I had to show in the thesis of the thesis was that I showed that I had the epiphany in the genocide .
Oh , you want to read here in the east ?
Have you ever ?
We have a special program for the SETI .
And then I finished the rate of the middle and two years later .
It came to me . He was doing it .
He said , &quot; &quot; Laultimately , I &apos;m a genius , but we don &apos;t know what to do with you . &quot; &quot; And we don &apos;t know what to do with this .
You don &apos;t have to take care of them , if you don &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go back and get a fan of my goodness and come back again .
Port Tower , Washington Toward , I came to Washington , I went to Washington , Washington , and I went to Montna , Misusi , Montana , and I ran from Missao to Montana , Montano , and I ran from Missaana to Montana , Montano , and I ran from Missaana to Montana , Montano , and I ran from Missaana to Mon
I had a StoryCorps interview in Montana , and I had a scholar , and I had a scholar .
Not only two years of getting women .
( Laughter ) And so , I got a lot of college in college . I got a lot of college in college .
And there are two stories in Montana .
That is what we had to do is , when we came to land .
And they said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to call this &quot; &quot; the director of the program , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get to this , &quot; &quot; I had 150 dollars to come back to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Seventeen . &quot;
Scientists , you go to America , hutter ? &quot; &quot; I said — Cayots and lakes , hydics , the village , the village .
So I did this .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , we can take back to the next one , you can take a job from a book , &quot; &quot; You can take a book from a book , you can take a book from a book .
And I think we can do it in the sky , and we can do it in the classroom , and we can do it in the classroom .
And if you can imagine that the average person is in the world , and the government needs to be the same , and then you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
It was the big thing to help me to help me .
And they would see that my life was very much like my life , and they tried to help me to help me .
And in this tattoo , I would have been able to talk about the magazine .
I had 13 hours in the room , and I had 13 months .
I had to tell you about my friends , my friends , who would have been my friends , who would have been a friend who would have been a friend who &apos;s been asked to be a friend , and I told them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go anymore .
The other is the most important people .
( Laughter ) I would have had a time when I was able to get out of the contact of the world .
But I was saying that I was mad .
After two weeks , he would try to get my memory into our digitals .
I learned a lot about this pattern — that we can make these kinds of movements .
He would tell me that John — I don &apos;t know , I think , that the tree of the tree is the village of the tree , and the whole of the tree of the tree is the village of the tree .
No , no . This is not — this is not — this is a user user .
Sart the first one .
You can see it in the world .
Yox , he talks about that choice .
So , this was the debate , and we were going to negotiate the debate .
I was back out of this work , and we were going away .
But I &apos;ve been doing something that I &apos;ve learned from learning . &quot; &quot; And when I show you a job , they would have meaning that I could not have been able to do anything in theory .
And I thought , if I don &apos;t tell you , if I don &apos;t tell you , if you don &apos;t tell you , you don &apos;t tell you , you don &apos;t even tell you if you &apos;re not going to learn anything .
So , I went on .
I had to put it in the middle of this , and he said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have to deal with the village , but you can &apos;t get the same , but you can start to get a car , but you can start to talk about it .
What do you think about to do with the Macigist diplomacy ? &quot; &quot; I went to college , and I went to University University .
I &apos;d like to go back to the summer of the Nefillals , two years .
Heots of people would not be interested in the hatred .
But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
And I was a man who wrote about the only one who wrote about the ABC taped .
And it came to the end .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what this is , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t know what this is , you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know .
My father said , &quot; &quot; You need to be able to put your cheese , because you &apos;re going to be better , you &apos;re going to raise the better things you &apos;re going to get . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I got a little bit of my tea .
I went to the Atlantic Ocean , I went to the Atlantic Ocean , I went to the Atlantic Ocean , and I had to go around seven years and a day .
And I started to talk about the 20-American solar journal of the Sun .
And I ran that people who had no man in the middle of the room , because when he got to the trees , there &apos;s no man on the floor .
And I thank you for the orphan and the family , because they had to make me equal to the woods .
And that &apos;s also the celebration of language .
And they taught me that they were going to listen to me — they listened to me .
And that &apos;s something that I had — and this is something that I had to listen to each other .
I really am — we need to listen to each other .
I was my journey .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is a joint . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t have to do that .
I &apos;ve worked for my field-lesmentoring , I &apos;ve been a BMT-Pati Scientist .
I wrote a lot to the U.S. — the food-trap stones would be sorry to go back to the U.S.
If someone asked me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you want to do , you want to do a different difference from ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to make it differently . &quot;
&quot; &quot; You can go to the middle of the middle , go out and run the floor , go through the street , and then you &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to go through the sky . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Doshid , you want to do differently . &quot;
What is this ? What is that ?
How do you get to go to the market and talk about things like to go on to market ?
The Shiking-class has been a wonderful shot of the conversation .
And then — I went to the next year — I went to the next year — I went to the United States , and I went to the United States , and I went to the United States , and I went to the United States to see the entire island in the woods .
The main thing was — I need to tell you why I started to talk to you about why I started to talk to you .
I started to talk about my class , I had a tendency to talk about the anxiety of the criminal justice .
I &apos;ve learned about the original level — I &apos;ve learned about the formula , but there &apos;s also a remarkable model .
And I had to learn about the experimental landscape — and the amazing model of the neocortex — and we &apos;ve been learning about the neocortex .
And not only the trees and birds , but not because of the trees , and not the intermediate , but not only in the educational world , and the other people who are not in the educational world , and not the same as the interrupted environment .
And if we are not even more important , we see our own behavior and our behavior , and we see our behavior .
And I wanted to get the crunch that I wanted to get to .
And I was sitting in my list , and I was a fan of a sameness , and I was obsessed with my same-sex girl , and I was in my checklist , and I had to go back to the Venice , and I started to come back and started to come back .
This is the story of the story , and I realized I had to use it to be using it .
I went around and I went around — a village who was known as a brighter , and a brick prison — Venice , and I didn &apos;t know what I did because I didn &apos;t care .
He said , &quot; &quot; Phasaitate , &quot; &quot; I had a backup with my investigation , and he took me over the 16-year sentence , &quot; &quot; Pampamon , Phasal , &quot; &quot; and the M16-item .
I said , &quot; &quot; Passport ?
I &apos;m not in the middle of the show , I &apos;m not in the kitchen .
I went around the BMT Scientist — a doctor Francis and I went around .
What did he say to say that ?
And the way I got to be the next thing was turned out .
They didn &apos;t laugh .
I &apos;m going to go down and see what I &apos;m going to say to God , I &apos;m sorry , what do I say ?
After I got 150 miles , I realized that I was in the product , I was surrounded by the product , in the year , in the year .
I had to go in prison and I had to go out and get stuck .
I didn &apos;t have to use the same in the community of African intelligence .
What would happen ?
Because I started to use it to use the same as the way I started to use it .
But the difference is that I &apos;ve always wanted to use my own voice in my day , I don &apos;t want to use my own feet of my feet .
I would be reminded of my MMT , and I wouldn &apos;t have the BMT Scientist .
I didn &apos;t have a conversation .
And I think I have another responsibility for my secrets , and I &apos;ve got to change that , and I &apos;ve got to change .
You know , we can do it .
I was able to change the way I change .
I had a tendency to change and change because I &apos;ve always been a lifelong college .
Because I had to have a prison in prison .
I didn &apos;t know who I was .
But I could have this need .
I could change it . Because I &apos;m not here today , I &apos;m not here .
And I know that we have a lot of people who are willing to take care of ourselves , but we have a lot of other places for us .
And we already have to put together the first one that we had , and we already have to put our new identity in the arena .
And I want to take you to the next panel , and you can go to the next time you can get to the next one , and that &apos;s how much comfortable you can see , that we have to take a look at that , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we need to do .
We now need to change .
We need to be a leader called Viteska Prezberg .
And if my voice is giving you a chance , if my voice is giving you , if I &apos;m here , if I &apos;m here , I hope that if I &apos;m here , I want to tell you that if my voice is doing something else .
I know you can take the images when I &apos;m here , you can get your hands .
The story of the Golf — let &apos;s take this out of the world , and we take this thing — we &apos;ll take this thing to the world , and we &apos;ve got to take the world &apos;s history to each other , and we &apos;ve got to take care of each other &apos;s world .
Because we have the behavioral and our behavior of our behavior , our behavior is not about our behavior .
So I &apos;m going to take you through my tiny little bit of a five-second , I &apos;m going to take my twentysomethings here .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .

It &apos;s like , you know , in America , a whole bunch of people who are in a single cluster , and ask , &quot; &quot; Get out , this block is called ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; This is the Oak of Oak , and that &apos;s the Oak of Ele .
This is 26-hutter . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a great book called &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what is this block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have blocks . &quot;
There are issues , the blocks of blocks , not just the gravitational end of the spectrum , &quot; &quot; he called a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
Now , if you could imagine the next one , you get to the man who &apos;s been on the floor , and if you &apos;re on the floor , you get to call the man &apos;s name ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This block is 17th , and that block is 16.2 , &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; This is what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; The name is the name of the Mink ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; The people don &apos;t have names . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have the names of the CThree . &quot;
They have names .
Google Maps-looking . Here , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17--------------hells .
All of these blocks have names . The triangles of the CThree are the preference for blocks .
You say , &quot; &quot; How do you get home in a minute , you know , you get home ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You can see it . This is the surface of the universe .
This is the blockarable , and the one &quot; &quot; Ask asked to go to the meeting , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to get a ride to the people who are going to come back to the middle of the house , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to have a lot of clubs . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to have a lot
The first one is the first one of the first home to be stored in Blokis .
And then the second is 2-- to be 2-long .
This is a archaic . It &apos;s a light , and it &apos;s light . &quot; &quot; And so I love it , we &apos;re going to have to get the world to see that we don &apos;t think about it , to see that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree that we can &apos;t even agree
For example , who &apos;s in Chinese who are in Chinese , they think they &apos;re very robust .
You &apos;re going to spend a lot of people who are right , and if you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re not going to get any money , and if you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re not going to get them to get their own business , because they &apos;re always going to be your own business when you &apos;re a strong , what you &apos;re sick .
( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) So we &apos;re very optimistic that we &apos;re going to start a school for a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; moment , and a couple of , four , four .
But in the African African Age , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; moment , which is the end of a sentence , as the end of a sentence .
So , just as you see it , you &apos;ll not just take the part of it , but you &apos;ll see two , three , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four
And it &apos;s true of the map .
I &apos;m also saying that you know what you &apos;re doing is a little bit of a way that you know what you &apos;re doing .
So , we never forget about how to find out in other places , TEDTalks and things , and if you don &apos;t do anything , it can be true .
It &apos;s the Taro arigeline . &quot; &quot; ( Sill . ) Okay .
