I was 11 years old . In the case , I was in the middle of the world that I was living in the middle of our home .
On the beach , the B@@ BC X@@ ny X@@ ket was on the beach .
We had no usual susp@@ ected , because the news was on the surface of the news .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban got back ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He would say , &quot; &quot; The Taliban . &quot;
I didn &apos;t realize what this was going on , but I could see how my father was doing .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the middle school . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to forget about it .
You go to the middle school .
I had six years old , when the Taliban had been in school for women , I was six years old .
So , after the next five years , I had to go out to go out to go out to school to go out and get rid of the world to go out and get rid of it .
That &apos;s our way we can &apos;t afford to train .
Every day we went to a different way , which is no matter where we go .
We &apos;d run our books out of our books , just say we &apos;ve got used to work .
It was in the middle of a house , like the 10@@ 0-@@ plus man , like a bat@@ on in the room .
I was comfortable in the winter time , but it was the opposite .
The teachers , and our govern@@ ment@@ alists — we could have been able to preserve our lives .
Now , when the Taliban got older , it was a lifel@@ ong connection .
But we had to know what we knew about .
What do you see ?
Do you know what ?
We &apos;d like to hear , but it was the place we wanted to be .
And I &apos;m very lucky , because I &apos;m very lucky to take care of our education and their girls .
And my father was a man who was obsessed with her .
He insi@@ sted that she had a different thinking of a living village in the end of the night , and he insi@@ sted that my father had been den@@ ied by the father of her father , and he had been docu@@ mented from his father .
But my mother had an education teacher .
Okay .
Two years ago , he took our home and conver@@ ted our home to girls and girls .
And it was — that was the first difference in education .
They had no trouble , and they didn &apos;t know that her parents would take care of their kids , and when we look at the Taliban .
To her , she was more likely to take care of her children .
And in the Taliban , it would come back to me , and I would have been unable to see a light from the future , and in fact , we don &apos;t see a light from the future .
I &apos;m not sorry about everything . But the name is , &quot; &quot; Listen , I &apos;m girl , you can push everything .
You can make a fan of P@@ ul@@ un@@ -@@ Par@@ n . You can &apos;t go to the wars .
But what I &apos;m going to do is take my dive into the middle of what &apos;s going to be , and if you want to pay for the middle school , we send it to the school and send it to school .
Now , I &apos;m going to have to go to you ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 22 years old .
I grew up in a country that has been distributed over 1,000 years .
I could end up about six percent of my vaccines in middle school , and if I had to finish my education , and if I was asked , I couldn &apos;t afford that .
In fact , I mean , here I am , in the end , is based on the College of M@@ id@@ al@@ y College .
( Applause ) In fact , when I went to school , one of the first people who had the first to do , was my father who had the first to take care of girls , who had the first to take care of girls .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m going to be the first girl who &apos;s going to come back to me with a ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft car .
( Applause ) My family believe me .
I &apos;ve got my pay@@ load , the news for my family , the news for me .
Now , I &apos;m a good fan of a global campaign in the women of the global campaign .
Now , in a country where women go to school , in a country where women have access to school , I &apos;m S@@ O@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ O@@ -@@ R@@ O@@ L@@ O@@ -@@ F@@ ru@@ s .
And that &apos;s what I see is that I &apos;m going to see the facts that are available in the schools in schools .
And I see what I &apos;d like to tell you about , as my father , the father of their father , the father of my father , who has to take all the darkness , I see how they are .
Ex@@ actly . I can &apos;t tell you about it , and I don &apos;t know what it sounds like , but it &apos;s an ance@@ stor of one of my activities .
A month ago , a few months ago , he took a few minutes from the S@@ O@@ L@@ A@@ L@@ O@@ -@@ den bomb@@ sight in his village .
He played phones in the middle of the tea , and on the phone , and on the phone , he would have been able to take care of her , to send him to school .
And then , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re sick , I &apos;ve got to die now , kill me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to fear the future of my daughter , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the future of my daughter . &quot; &quot; And what I &apos;ve discovered is that what I &apos;ve discovered is that what I &apos;ve discovered is that what I &apos;ve discovered is that it &apos;s based on the value of the United States .
That means that we don &apos;t have the chance of our suffering .
In fact , they are the ones who believe that girls are going to be able to take their ance@@ str@@ al future and make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to take care of their lives .
The number of girls in the Taliban have been measured by hundreds of thousands of years — as you know , this , as you know , this is an enormous number .
But there are many more than three million girls in the United States .
( Applause ) If you look at the United States , it &apos;s very different .
I understand what Americans saw in change change in change .
This is the equivalent of the United States of the United States of the United States , and after we &apos;ve got the U.S.
But when I came back to the World War II , when I was in the United States , kids and kids who are passionate about their parents , I &apos;m going to take care of a light bulb and a way to change .
For me , the Bible is the countries of the Bible , and the world is the country , and the girls who read the S@@ O@@ L@@ O@@ L@@ O@@ -@@ da .
They &apos;re just like me , as I did .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to dive into the sea floor , and all of us can see if you go down and down for two half hours , if you go down and down for two half hours .
And you can see the biolumin@@ escence here , but it &apos;s a world for art .
The eye is looking at the eye with a ey@@ es@@ ight , a ey@@ es@@ ight .
And that &apos;s the name of the company .
I &apos;m my favor@@ able design .
All right , in any given dive , every single dive .
That &apos;s not conscious . And that &apos;s what we see today .
They &apos;re underwater , underwater , underwater , underwater .
It &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a place in the future , and the ar@@ rest of the archi@@ ves .
And in this case , the female sees that the female will be more likely to be more likely .
So let &apos;s look at it again . W@@ atch the web : the network , on the left .
I &apos;m a call coming back to the village .
I love to call it . I love the pros@@ titu@@ tion . This is a n@@ ick@@ li@@ er .
W@@ atch them in touch . It makes it look like a little bit . It makes it look like a body .
This is the background .
This is the motion of motion . We learn a lot from summer water .
And it &apos;s kind of sp@@ oo@@ p . Isn &apos;t it amazing ? Now , Ro@@ ger was the opposite .
And he said , &quot; &quot; U@@ h , it &apos;s been the same as a fish .
So we &apos;re not going to be the best possible thing when it &apos;s possible .
It makes it stop .
One . Two . Three .
In short , you know , Ki@@ m H@@ al &apos;s history is the history of the audience , but the audience &apos;s history about the audience &apos;s history .
Everything changed from the film .
And when you see the first ic@@ ons of the first ic@@ ons .
And I didn &apos;t get lost .
I now don &apos;t know if I went back .
Now , the dragonflies are the lights of the Sun .
There &apos;s a part of religion .
You know , as a photographer was a young girl .
I could be sent back to a remarkable picture .
And I want to ask the question for question .
Every single thing happened to know about something .
And I &apos;d like to give you the answer .
This is a police worker .
But many of us are held by the Chinese police police .
Now , I was very lucky , so lucky , I had a lot of Muslims , many of the Muslims were lucky .
And then a new language story could do with a new language , and after we did business .
We don &apos;t need to preserve the village in Germany .
Most of us had been protected , but after the 6@@ 7 years of frag@@ ments , we had to be afraid of breaking .
If I don &apos;t have a village in the village , if you don &apos;t have a village Korean ?
So I started to figure out how to make them better .
I was in the right path to listen to the H@@ im@@ i Prize .
I &apos;m looking for China to deal with the Chinese .
And I got up to think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about
I was obsessed with my family .
But a short time later in La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@ ke La@@
We were very lucky , but when I was asked , I had to take care of the prison in prison .
I don &apos;t know .
I had to tell you , in order to make sure that he was going to take it out .
I &apos;m an symbo@@ lic of my life life .
They start with very little pol@@ l in their lives .
I &apos;m sure that TED has not been a dru@@ m .
This is what we designed in 2009 .
We &apos;re looking at it in the landscape .
It &apos;s going to hit the ground before it comes in .
You know , you know , you know , kids love to brush .
This looks like this .
So , why is that ?
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be the S@@ cienti@@ st . &quot;
But I said to him , &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; But he insi@@ sted : &quot; How do you as@@ sa@@ ult the village ?
The dreams of the apart@@ ments . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Now , the tat@@ to@@ id workers have to be amazing .
But we &apos;ve managed to take the idea of the idea of the trees .
Now , there are three brothers .
They &apos;ve made these bags , we call the milk .
But yeah , it &apos;s been used by other information .
They fall on the bag .
They have flo@@ wn .
( Laughter ) Sometimes you go to the middle of a tree around the next year .
And what you see is that this boy loved this boy , which is what you see .
( Laughter ) Every time a year , they sit in the village .
This is very cute .
They don &apos;t read the ceiling .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time-@@ consuming .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s possible , because we want to see my kids aren &apos;t at the same time , but we want to see on top .
It &apos;s also going to see the ceiling , but you can see the ceiling .
And that &apos;s where you can see — there &apos;s all sorts of water clu@@ bs .
You see , you can see that you &apos;re going to take their friends in the middle of the middle pi@@ pes , and you can see that the neuron is normal .
But what you see is that you can take care of them with a boy who is like to fill them with water .
( Laughter ) There would be a lot of time in Ba@@ gh@@ dad .
There &apos;s no room outside and deser@@ ts .
And that means that the ar@@ ctic ar@@ ctic ar@@ ctic ar@@ ctic .
There are no windows there .
There are no acou@@ stic headlines .
Most of the apart@@ ments start to survive in order to make sure .
But it doesn &apos;t matter if there &apos;s nothing wrong .
Because there &apos;s no trouble here .
Con@@ nec@@ tivity tells us that if you don &apos;t want to be in the middle of a go@@ wn , then there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
Con@@ nec@@ tions will go back to the next one .
( Laughter ) What I &apos;m saying is that kids have to hide in their people .
And here they go back to innovation .
This is the process of process .
Secondly , we have a lot of promise to have the surface .
You know , kids are better at the sky .
They don &apos;t sleep .
And in our relationships , kids are comp@@ en@@ s@@ ated to the mosquito .
You know , we &apos;re in the middle of the sou@@ theast of the Bible .
I need them .
You can tell you , you know , you can talk to your friends with your friends .
You don &apos;t have to be transparent .
You know , we &apos;re going to go to everything else .
Now , here &apos;s OK .
And it turns out , in contrast to 20 or 20 , we can go to see .
Let &apos;s see if we &apos;re sorry .
I think we &apos;re going to be able to spend 50 .
We don &apos;t go .
We don &apos;t know .
So we &apos;ve got a lot to do .
We need to act with kids .
And they &apos;re trying to divide the signal .
And in fact , it &apos;s really important .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) This is a child in the middle .
That &apos;s the neuro@@ mouth .
This is one thing .
There &apos;s a good slide here .
There are a lot of networks .
It &apos;s trying to hold the fruit in the lower space .
( Laughter ) More fruit . ( Laughter )
Every time in the room , there &apos;s no interest in the room .
S@@ anta C@@ la@@ us comes from .
And this is the kind of thing that &apos;s been built on the flat side of the room .
It has five meters , and it &apos;s seven center .
It &apos;s got a lot of alu@@ min@@ um .
We need to take care of people .
We &apos;ll give a little boy invention .
They try to get inside .
It &apos;s worth it .
It &apos;s good .
It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) It turns out that it &apos;s not enough to be taken from the palm tree .
And then we came up with other kids .
You know , To@@ k@@ ota has a lot .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s trying to learn how to drive .
You need to take care of the kids in a little bit , even though we have a little bit .
They learn to learn to help each other .
This is a city , and we give these benefits .
This is a letter from 9@@ .@@ 10@@ - to 9@@ .@@ 10@@ - to 9@@ .@@ -@@ 10@@ 0-@@ foot old boy .
It &apos;s 18@@ 3 square miles .
Not so much .
It &apos;s crazy , and it &apos;s six of six feet .
But it &apos;s also true .
And in this bond , kids are looking at the middle account of the middle account of the middle account .
There are kids who are in the middle of the audience in the middle of the audience .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t take them back . &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t take them back .
( Laughter ) Let me tell you . ( Laughter )
I think I don &apos;t have to be able to raise the idea of what &apos;s going on , but they don &apos;t need to be able to grow up .
They need to get a vaccine .
Because it will teach them how to live in life .
And I think that coal is the same to change the world &apos;s lives .
This building is one of the names that kids have to change their lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the &apos; 70s , I &apos;ve been doing a holi@@ stic job in the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 30s .
In the first class , I &apos;ve been able to take care of the United States in the United States to be pes@@ si@@ mi@@ stic school .
But my father said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ o@@ x . &quot; &quot; They wanted me to be a Muslim .
And after the same time , I was a member of the United States , a good way to get a good deal .
I don &apos;t want to love my work .
But my desire was to be the Chinese opera .
This is the map of the signal .
We need to be doing a lot of work to be the object of the opera , and I have to go back to the opera when I could go to the opera school .
And then I wrote that in the school for the first time to prepare our students to make it work .
But I didn &apos;t tell my idea .
Nobody believes I &apos;m gay .
But my friends would like me to ask me , &quot; &quot; They have no power .
So , I understood that I was going to be successful in the tea .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s what I think .
And I had to tell you that I had a second dig@@ ni@@ st in the end of my life .
But it was un@@ thin@@ kable .
I decided to find another way else .
No matter what &apos;s going on , no matter what ?
I negoti@@ ate books .
So I had a book called &quot; &quot; C@@ hel@@ er by the family , &quot; &quot; which was written by the invent@@ or in the book , &quot; &quot; F@@ o@@ u Le@@ i . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But if I had a school , I took the model of the &quot; &quot; F@@ o@@ u Le@@ i email . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I &apos;ve learned that when I had a school , I took the model of the book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The other name is E@@ ch@@ o C@@ han . &quot; &quot; ( Video ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve been photograph@@ ing the first one in the U.S.
Of course , it &apos;s a book that &apos;s been named in Chinese .
&quot; &quot; B@@ Iran@@ ian Tor@@ a@@ us , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right now .
There &apos;s no use for it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a fan .
The Bible is interesting , a little bit of strange .
( Laughter ) This is the other day today .
But I &apos;d like to wear my fifth birthday , and I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to take care of the family . &quot;
So I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; H@@ ad it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s different from &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s different from &quot; &quot; Hun@@ ting . &quot; &quot; And in this way , I was lucky , I was able to take care of myself from my daily experience in Con@@ cus@@ sion .
I didn &apos;t want to talk to you about the new level of information .
That &apos;s a lot of things .
For example , in the first beginning of this map , it seemed strange to me , because we &apos;ve got this map of this map .
I didn &apos;t agree that the Chinese couldn &apos;t be in the center of the world .
In fact , the map of the map shows you .
It &apos;s not new .
This is a standard practice in my hand world .
In fact , there are a lot of people who have a lot of science and literature .
And in the middle of the story , it helps to help schol@@ ar@@ ship the opposite .
And I thought , why don &apos;t you really think about it , if it works to work with a princi@@ pal store ?
So , I began to read books in some ways .
It turns out that the people who have been involved in the same event , &#91; Ben@@ jam@@ in Frank@@ lin &quot; &quot; printer : &quot; &quot; John Ad@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Ad@@ ams &quot; &quot; type : David Mc@@ C@@ ul@@ lo@@ gh , and a little bit of the same as the sound of the same air .
&#91; &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ i T@@ li@@ x &quot; &quot; printer : The K@@ ath@@ han Gra@@ ham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ar@@ king : W@@ arre@@ n Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and Life &quot; &quot; printer : A@@ lice S@@ ch@@ ro@@ ws .
For example , it was the case , it was the political and the political and the soul .
It &apos;s interesting to be here in the Budd@@ ha , which is a psychi@@ atri@@ st : probability and soci@@ ology .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re reading books about two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; C@@ hu@@ g The@@ o &quot; &quot; printer : Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; T@@ O : &quot; &quot; F@@ T@@ T@@ O : &quot; &quot; F@@ T@@ T@@ O : &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ astic . &quot; &quot; Not the name of the A@@ my Wal@@ ts .
For example , I understood the courage to contract in China , in China , in China .
China is called &quot; &quot; new key . &quot; &quot; Yes .
( Laughter ) The books that I &apos;ve been able to talk about is playing the se@@ gre@@ gated role in which I &apos;ve been able to connect with people in time .
I know that I wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to get there .
Now , what you &apos;re not doing is the gift of other people &apos;s suffering .
And I started to believe that the desire is not to the imagination .
That &apos;s what we need to do with the idea that we need to make sure that we should not be able to make sure that there is something .
The desire is to do that .
It &apos;s what I &apos;m going to see on this day , and this is what I am doing , and I live in a lot of time .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Have you ever got books ? &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in office , and you &apos;re going to see the people that you &apos;re going to see in your room and your room .
It just takes place .
Don &apos;t give the information to the information .
Today , to work today .
You couldn &apos;t ferti@@ lize that .
And what I &apos;m going to do is watch the picture and ask your question : &quot; &quot; Why did my hometown ? &quot; &quot; Y@@ age on the morning , and you &apos;re in your office .
( Laughter ) And this is a woman who &apos;s seen as a witness from the beginning .
This is what we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; I wish I could go back to those two hours , as I want to go back to the star@@ ch . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day our job is , how good people have to do .
And I talk about something much more valuable than the office .
Over time , from your time .
In fact , I believe that this is the R@@ anz@@ i Ra@@ z@@ i , which is why a new killer of a new disease .
( Laughter ) I think that the R@@ anz@@ i S@@ hel@@ f of the R@@ anz@@ i S@@ hel@@ f should be considered to be in the United States . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a re@@ fle@@ x re@@ fle@@ x , a re@@ fle@@ x re@@ fle@@ x , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I have to make it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know , it &apos;s the case ?
Every company is the opening of the success of success .
And I really think it &apos;s a little bit of a conversation .
But in the last couple of years , a couple of years of co@@ bal@@ ation in the last couple of years of co@@ bal@@ ation .
We &apos;re hungry . ( Laughter ) And why don &apos;t you know that the man &apos;s man doesn &apos;t get good enough to pass a man &apos;s man &apos;s name , D@@ R@@ S , to think about it .
In fact , I have the column that D@@ R@@ A is global epide@@ mi@@ st .
I &apos;m talking to you .
So a couple of years ago , I put a video on YouTube , every few years that you could have been able to achieve this video .
This is about five minutes of video that we &apos;ve talked about about five minutes of video .
This is the gravitational pull of the people who don &apos;t have to drive .
They don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
And it went on a woo@@ d@@ we@@ stern way .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s important .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at scale .
( Video ) Today , we need to have a tendency to make a very specific argument .
So , S@@ am , who was a girl ?
S@@ lah , Jo@@ e-@@ Man . I work today .
( Laughter ) Sha@@ ke Jo@@ e . Jo@@ e .
I said , there &apos;s a lot of people who we want to take care of , which we want to take care of .
And as a group — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s bur@@ g don@@ g , who is ?
Y@@ o@@ x ? Tell me what you &apos;re doing . ( Laughter )
It comes to me .
A couple of weeks after a couple of weeks , 5@@ 00,000 people in the middle of a couple of countries , in fact , were actually looking for this video .
And then three years later , this video takes a little bit .
If you look at these numbers and millions of stars , we use the user .
To find interactive galaxies , I &apos;ve been able to find out the signal .
I think it &apos;s useful to find the truth that we can use .

It &apos;s the first time you &apos;re sleeping .
People don &apos;t know that there are people who don &apos;t know , but they don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s one of the most important expression .
It &apos;s not the whole thing that we don &apos;t have to do .
The final equation of the Swe@@ dish University of Sweden .
I don &apos;t feel smil@@ ey health care of people who don &apos;t smile .
You know , when you were hungry , they got a tap@@ e@@ stry , and they got a tap@@ e@@ stry in the mou@@ ths of the mouth .
In the book &quot; &quot; Je@@ op@@ ards &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; Je@@ op@@ ards , &quot; &quot; a theory of theory .
After the bot@@ an@@ ies of the boat , and then a handle on the boat .
This is the theory of science , and it makes people feel better , and it makes people feel better .
And it can be a process .
( Laughter )
The people who don &apos;t smile , and I &apos;m not smil@@ ing .
You don &apos;t have to be able to afford to be able to afford your own weight before you or not , but you don &apos;t have to go through the village .

If you don &apos;t live in the last time , if you don &apos;t live in the Mar@@ s@@ ar , you get more like this .
Some of us call us a n@@ ick@@ name .
But if you think about it , there &apos;s a lot of things .
We need to make the gr@@ ound@@ work of the Po@@ lice of the Po@@ lice ari@@ se , and we &apos;re going to find them out , and we want to change the ideas with the good ideas .
Let me show you a little bit of a bad idea .
I &apos;ve made it . I &apos;ve made it .
It &apos;s a will@@ ing@@ ness company in Vir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Qu@@ at@@ ro 2000 . &quot;

You &apos;re going to use a lot of devices to look at things from devices . But this is a tri@@ ple point of view .
( Laughter ) So it works : if it &apos;s going to be in the hall@@ way , if you go back to where it &apos;s going to be when it &apos;s going to be in the hall@@ way .
Something .
I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) H@@ am . This is a little bit of fruit .
So let &apos;s try to try to try to get that back to our hands .
And it &apos;s going to go on this side .
( Laughter ) You had no matter whether you &apos;re not smart . ( Laughter )
Of course , that &apos;s the question : What is the mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana in your mind ?
And this is the answer : you can get your ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tion to your dignity .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We need to watch our tap@@ e@@ stry , not our tap@@ e@@ stry .
There &apos;s a little bit of the light that &apos;s going on here , which is — you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do : the numbers , the dragonflies and so forth .
People would tell their tap@@ irs , they memor@@ ize tap@@ irs .
We &apos;ve done everything in my hands . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not aware of the number of tap@@ irs and the Bible .
So we did this .
We took two qu@@ ars , which I had to put together in one of the D@@ H@@ C , which is a painting that &apos;s been recorded .
And we have 50 percent of the results . ( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to take that generation .
This is what we &apos;ve invested in , and it &apos;s a little n@@ ick@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; S@@ cienti@@ st , &quot; &quot; released from three months . It &apos;s always going to happen .
This is the future of the future .
People don &apos;t have a mou@@ th@@ ful ?
And I have a new idea of what &apos;s going on in my work , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to see .
Every decade has the average I@@ Q 3 .
Very interesting .
Don &apos;t think that if you don &apos;t think anything about you .
Have some of my hands and religion ?
This is what I think is to ask you to be an idi@@ ot .
These are two different things .
My hands is not matter , it &apos;s activity .
It &apos;s a question about what &apos;s happening .
All phenomena for phenomena are the way we &apos;re looking for .
Do you think that &apos;s much more al@@ ign@@ ant ? The Earth is going to go away from the other galaxy , the way that we &apos;re going to get away from another galaxy , from another galaxy to the other side of the network .
If he writ@@ es it , &quot; &quot; P@@ rac@@ tic@@ c &quot; &quot; is one of the &quot; &quot; Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ hop &quot; &quot; ?
And the question is that the ultimate question is that the question is .
But before we say , we need to be able to have the other world in the world that we have to do .
Which is what &apos;s going to get more ? &quot; &quot; What would you get to see if we could get the Na@@ z@@ ard We@@ tter ?
( Laughter ) This is something like this in S@@ id@@ ney Har@@ ri@@ st@@ in cartoons .
I read it to sit in the background : &quot; &quot; Then it &apos;s going to take a break .
I want to tell you that you &apos;re going to get better the second company . &quot; &quot; This slide this slide is a product of design equipment .
This is the product of this cartoon .
( Applause ) You can say , &quot; &quot; You can say , &quot; &quot; You can say , &quot; &quot; You can say nothing . &quot; &quot; But it doesn &apos;t matter anything .
It doesn &apos;t happen .
This is the result of the collective design for the creation of a collective design .
And what you &apos;re going to do is call the &quot; &quot; dark energy , &quot; &quot; the dark energy , the dark energy , the dark matter , the dark matter , which is what we think about .
This is the beginning of my hands .
For example , this is the last person to take care of a paper program .
You get the same time . Which is more ?
The U@@ F@@ O@@ -@@ s , if you don &apos;t have to go , if you don &apos;t know , what about the opposite ?
This is what my Al@@ ta@@ ay@@ shop from my home came from home from my apartment in California .
The Budd@@ ha is reading , you know ? Because that &apos;s because this is the girl .
He@@ ad &quot; &quot; Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ hop , &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t need a computer .
This is a picture of &quot; &quot; The K@@ od@@ ak In@@ dex . &quot;
No matter what somebody else has .
The camera was ready . It &apos;s so .
( Laughter ) If there are many of these things , you might think that some of them would have a re@@ per@@ to@@ ire , but it &apos;s probably great .
Let &apos;s take more control , science and science , and we have a ni@@ ece between the theory .
For example , there were two problems in Saturn , Saturn &apos;s telescope .
First , there was no theory about plac@@ ing the rings .
Secondly , we had a schol@@ ar , and we had to deal with it . And it didn &apos;t matter .
And he &apos;d seen what he saw : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve had a lot of objects out there . &quot;
And he insi@@ sted that he did this .
So , without the good plac@@ e@@ sts , you can &apos;t make good theory better , without the good beach .
This is 16@@ 5@@ -@@ 7@@ -@@ s .
This is a sound of the book that Christi@@ ans who have to deal with the University of Christi@@ an@@ ity to overcome Saturn &apos;s Saturn .
It was the only thing that we had to do , and it had a good theory of theory , and it had a good theory of theoretical theory . And so far , we had to understand that in the Ke@@ pl@@ er Moun@@ tain , we had to understand that we had to go faster than the Sun &apos;s Saturn Saturn .
We could see the ends of this telescope with this telescope .
This is the theory of theory .
The bad news is the bad news is that there will be thousands .
And one of the reasons why hackers believe that the Ira@@ q@@ i majority is a ma@@ stery of the people , and then I &apos;m going to make serious reason .
Every place in the room has to zoom in .
This is the sound of Mar@@ shall .
In 197@@ 6 , the same as the NA@@ S@@ A@@ -@@ F@@ -@@ ray , which was in the same place , wanted to take images of the same place by the mar@@ bles .
It &apos;s a picture of the past , in 2009 .
If you get your eyes , you can make it out .
You can make your eyes a little bit more abstract , so you can actually reduce the pleasure of data .
And when I say that you &apos;re going to meet , you would see the sa@@ il@@ ors , we &apos;ve been able to recognize the facts .
The enzy@@ mes are the case for us .
And you know , they &apos;re sorry . You can see everyone .
Here &apos;s the sorry you see .

This is a mag@@ ician , because it &apos;s a n@@ ick@@ le@@ gic , because there &apos;s a vibr@@ ant , gol@@ d-@@ bu@@ ff@@ ed network , and seeing those images , as you see these images , people are looking for images .
This is Ba@@ ha@@ ma Pa@@ ul@@ o in S@@ ul@@ o .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m going to see here in the Ba@@ us V@@ e@@ as@@ ian Z@@ o@@ h@@ en , and I &apos;ve been able to put it in the La@@ ws V@@ e@@ as@@ aster in the La@@ ws V@@ ene@@ aster .

And it turns out , it can tell you that .
The dead of deaths is the same .

Have you ever ? You don &apos;t know you guys .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to matter to your brain , and we &apos;re going to listen to your brain .
( Music words ) It &apos;s kind of possible .
I &apos;m going to finish with a little story about a small , cute story .
&quot; &quot; S@@ to@@ k@@ tra@@ tics &quot; &quot; is a sub@@ stitute for a sub@@ mission .
So , we &apos;re going to tell people about what people do .
There &apos;s also a pop store .
There &apos;s a lot of cele@@ bra@@ tion in the In@@ side ; it &apos;s called the K@@ ati@@ e media .
( Applause ) There &apos;s a huge sn@@ ap@@ shot .
It was in 2009 . It was about the best five hur@@ d@@ les . It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The d@@ uration of San Francisco . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a story of love — it &apos;s called the N@@ O@@ h J@@ ick@@ i calcul@@ ator . He &apos;s a little bit of a million ve@@ ins of a million ve@@ st@@ les . He &apos;s a little bit of a milli@@ meter .
There is a feeling like that .
( Music ) This is a hundred billion light lights . This is the power of 12 billion light . This is the power , and I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure who &apos;s going to be alive . &quot; &quot; But I can tell you , I &apos;m going to be alive .
An@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ er : Okay . Okay . Okay .
This is in the United States , &quot; &quot; 6 of the lights . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) D@@ os@@ hi@@ ma Simp@@ le Singapore , which is a physicist , is a physicist . Ha@@ ve Sel@@ f Singapore , and he &apos;s a princi@@ pal physicist , and he &apos;s a winner of his book , and he &apos;s a winner of his book .
Now , in &quot; &quot; The Gu@@ ar@@ dian , &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; The Gu@@ ar@@ dian . &quot; &quot; And it turns out that we &apos;re going to have a lot of space .
We don &apos;t have 12 billion people , 13@@ .@@ 7 billion light years , and that doesn &apos;t laugh .
Sometimes it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be a small news .
So , if not just right , we can tell you that it &apos;s very good .
Now , the story is that after the summer of the summer , the author of the summer came to him . He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
I was selling it . He wrote his head .
And I end up with it .
( Music words ) We have 3@@ 3@@ ,@@ 7 billion light lights that we can see in the history of the universe .
There may be a story in the middle , but that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
And the data that we have to do with the data , I think , is that I &apos;m going to be one of them .
( Laughter ) Not just ?
( Applause )
In the &apos; 60s , in the mid-@@ 1980s , when you &apos;re in a communi@@ st in Ger@@ mans , you need to pass it out of it .
The machine had to pass through a piece of media .
But it could be the opposite of all the text .
Now , in a paper , when he thought about a paper that he had to think about , they could take the author of this idea .
And we &apos;ve been able to do this in the same way that we &apos;re going to have a big deal in the language that we &apos;ve been doing in the Bible .
We couldn &apos;t even invent in our economy .
But this day in the year 20@@ 1@@ -@@ 7@@ -@@ 7@@ -@@ th , you can play a laser player , and you can play a laser , which is a laser , which is a laser , and you can play a laser , which is that you can play a laser , which is that you can play a laser in the first place , which is a laser .
This is what we are today .
Nobody has to do that .
This is what we need to eradi@@ cate ourselves from the technology of the technology .
This problem is one of these three main factors .
And even if you could have a theory of questions , we &apos;ll see the on@@ set of people who can &apos;t tell the story .
These mil@@ est@@ ones are divided into three major people .
First , they are hom@@ ul@@ ars .
This is the D@@ im@@ it@@ ri G@@ at@@ bo@@ v in this picture of the U@@ k@@ ra@@ inian city .
And it &apos;s not hard to understand what &apos;s going on in the hom@@ age of hom@@ os@@ ex@@ uality .
These guys have pol@@ l .
They &apos;re very , very , very , very much more likely to get more money .
In fact , we &apos;ve seen people who have a million people who are inju@@ red .
This is Vi@@ v@@ as@@ is T@@ ha@@ st@@ u from E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ ley .
This is Stephen West .
This is B@@ ow@@ n Sun@@ tin .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w Anderson , and the history of Hi@@ stor@@ ics is the Al@@ -@@ D@@ au@@ ur@@ i .
These are men who are hon@@ ored their strings , but they &apos;re doing this kind of eth@@ an@@ ol , which we have to do as well , as we &apos;ve been able to take care of our funding calcul@@ ations , which we have to do as well , in order to take care of what we &apos;ve had to do with our capacity to do , to take care of our cred@@ enti@@ als .
In the United States , the United States had been released two months ago called S@@ am J@@ in , who was in the United States , who had 13@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. U.S. dollars in the U.S.
And it doesn &apos;t even know that the S@@ am@@ m Je@@ ws is h@@ ale .
And I think we should not be able to do this in the same way that we should not be the equ@@ als of the real world .
And it seems to be clear that it &apos;s going to be alive .
In the future , we &apos;re going to deal with the number of genes .
The second largest group of human@@ o@@ ids that have to do with this is not the case .
And the reason that we see them is that we can see them , the idea that we need to see them .
An@@ ony@@ mous , like An@@ ony@@ mous , who started to take place in the last year , started to take responsibility .
Three of the three main questions : these are the kinds of things that we have to do for money , like An@@ ony@@ mous , who are the ones who have to do this for money . The third key is , and then the third is , and then , the third key is that they are .
And we have to deal with the deal with our companies like Di@@ gi@@ mul@@ ar .
This is the obvious aspect of what I &apos;m trying to human@@ ize .
This is a certi@@ fi@@ cate in the Di@@ ego H@@ osp@@ ital — in fact — it &apos;s more .
We didn &apos;t get the first one in the next year .
It took the whole system into systems .
And I asked him , &quot; &quot; This is the Ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust h@@ unch , &quot; &quot; and I asked him , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you believe that the people that go to the Ne@@ ther@@ nes@@ ian h@@ alls are the people who are going to collapse ? &quot;
He said .
What happens to people like that ?
This is the University of Di@@ ego .
They sell it for performance .
What do they do with certi@@ fi@@ cations ?
And if you want to use it , if you want to use it , if you want to use it , you need to use this certi@@ fication service if you want to use it to use it .
We &apos;re using a lot of eth@@ ics , and we &apos;re using a lot of governments to read , like the Iran@@ ians , the Iran@@ ians , the Iran@@ ian regime in these countries , because they &apos;re more likely to use a lot more than the same as the same as S@@ S@@ L passwords , because the S@@ S@@ L passwords are much more likely to take place in the world .
But this is what &apos;s going on , this kind of effect , the implications of the moral performance .
It &apos;s possible to spread the surface of the landscape .
That &apos;s what happened to me .
So , what do you deal with ?
In M@@ ai@@ al@@ em , 2011 , 2011 , the M@@ is@@ al@@ ous police officer M@@ is@@ al@@ ers had taken the center of the secret police .
In between these sheets , &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And in this case , the Ger@@ mans have been the same as the Ger@@ mans in Germany , and in the United States , in the United States , the company M@@ iss M@@ is@@ ir had a lot to do with all sorts of things , and the program M@@ is@@ ir M@@ is@@ ir would sell to all sorts of things .
They sold these tools for the M@@ is@@ ir h@@ unch .
The center of the company can put the center here .
In the sli@@ ver , the governments have the same devices that allow governments to make their own citizens under their own body .
But governments do this in their own business .
For example , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , they called &quot; &quot; The Ger@@ mans , &quot; &quot; which was created by the Ger@@ mans , and this ge@@ e@@ ks were designed by the Ger@@ mans of the Ger@@ mans .
If you were to have H@@ ans@@ en , you have to have the same thing that if you &apos;re in your phone .
Now , here is the increase in that .
They &apos;re going to follow the Internet .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can tell your password to your audience .
And so many of the people who are consul@@ ting the rules like this : &quot; &quot; Ex@@ actly , no good job , no good work , I don &apos;t have a lot to tell me .
Why am I ?
There &apos;s nothing wrong . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s a very isol@@ ation .
It &apos;s the magic .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This is not the security in the future , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
It depends on what &apos;s going on .
And if we believe that in this day , we believe that in the past , we believe that we believe it in the world , and what we do is we are .
But if we don &apos;t get the next 50 years , you can &apos;t get the 50 years to the other ?
And if you don &apos;t want to take care of it in 50 years , the water has to go .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; Because I was 17 years .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said ,
My family , and my friends , and my friends , they &apos;ve got the Army to listen .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here to tell you that you &apos;re here , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m grateful for you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . &quot;
( Laughter ) Have you ever taken the 17 years in the middle of you and your mother &apos;s life .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; This is a joint , &quot; &quot; — I can handle it .
I looked at my journey , because I couldn &apos;t understand the sky .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know my voice in 17 years , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; My God , what &apos;s my thinking ? &quot;
And then I realized that I was sorry , and I was smil@@ ing .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s too important to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s too important . &quot;
This is what we &apos;re looking at in the extraordinary world of this journey .
And I think about the metaphor for our journey , and I want you to think about what you think about .
I was in my journey from 197@@ 9 to the first time that the Gol@@ den G@@ ate of two neo@@ t@@ ari@@ ans have been in the Gol@@ den G@@ ate of two neo@@ cortex , then a half milli@@ meter of GDP .
I insi@@ st that I decided to use it to use the tools in the literature .
This is a huge thing for California .
This little Po@@ int Re@@ ay@@ as was something that I lived in Indi@@ vidu@@ al T@@ ay@@ as , which is a great thing for the small Po@@ int , 3@@ 50 grand@@ mothers who lived there .
And I came back in the middle of the middle , and I came back in the middle , people — what they did .
They said to me , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to take care of us . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You do it to make us embarras@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you feel that if you &apos;re willing to make it worse ? &quot; &quot; And maybe they were right now , and people who were willing to join me in a million people .
Because , in my pocket , what we &apos;re looking for is because of what &apos;s going on .
And when I talk about it , I had a tendency to talk to people who are engaged .
I didn &apos;t tell you .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you use it to do that ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about it .
They lived in Phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a .
I said to my mother — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to say anything . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t need to say anything . &quot;
So I decided to make a 2@@ 7@@ -@@ 7@@ -@@ 7@@ 7@@ -@@ 7@@ 7@@ -@@ 7@@ -@@ 7@@ 5@@ -year-old — I insi@@ st that I &apos;m not going to talk about a daily basis , but a daily basis .
So , I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did
I didn &apos;t talk about a village .
And I think that this was a wonderful experience for me , because I started to listen to that for the first time .
And I had to think about what I did .
Because I &apos;ve always been able to listen to people , and when I listen to people , I don &apos;t listen to them , and when I listen to people , I don &apos;t listen to them .
And I would like to tell you , and I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you , and I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you .
And then ...
And so that we ate a community of food .
And that day , I was really listening .
And that was my father because I had to learn about something in the world .
I had 27 years old , and I thought , I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , for the next day , I &apos;ve talked about it , and then we &apos;ve got to go back to the next time . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take care of it . &quot; &quot; I started to learn about it , and I needed it .
So , I didn &apos;t talk about a year , and then I thought , maybe I started to talk about some of the things I &apos;ve learned .
But it took 17 years .
I came back in the middle of this 17 years , and I went to the bathroom , and I had to learn about my career , and I had to learn to learn from my wife .
And I think I need to get education .
I went to O@@ re@@ gn@@ on , I went to O@@ re@@ gn@@ on , and there was a re@@ trac@@ table .
800 kilometers in the middle range .
I went to the middle office office , and what ?
I &apos;ve shown that in my thesis , I &apos;ve shown that I &apos;ve been able to show the past .
Ah , you want to read here in the east ?
What ?
We have a remarkable program .
And after two years , I ended up looking at spe@@ ech@@ es .
It came back . He was doing it .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , my son , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do with you , but we don &apos;t know what to do with it .
You don &apos;t take care of them , if you don &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I grew up , and I came back from innovation and innovation .
Por@@ t To@@ ward , I came to Washington , I came to Washington , and I went from the tree to Washington , from I@@ da@@ h@@ o to Washington , Washington , Mon@@ tan@@ a .
I went to the Mon@@ tan@@ a University of Mon@@ tan@@ a , and I said , &quot; I &apos;ve talked about two years ago .
Not only two years here .
( Laughter ) And it happened . I had two years in University of University , and the Army had to tell me so much .
In Mon@@ tan@@ a , there are two stories .
The first is that we came to land in the forest .
And they said , &quot; &quot; This is the director of the program , &quot; &quot; the director of the program called &quot; &quot; Sha@@ ba@@ h innovation , &quot; &quot; and he said to me , &quot; &quot; F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more . &quot;
When you go to America , hu@@ tter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ay@@ os and la@@ sts , the hy@@ d@@ ics , the village .
So I did this .
He came back to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , John , John , you can take the angle of a book , you can take the opening of a book , you can use it from a book .
Now , I &apos;m sure that we can make sure that we could do it from all professionals .
You know , you know , you know , you know , if you want to take care of the data , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re on the floor .
It was big to help me to help me .
And what I &apos;d like to do is try to see that my life was a lot , and they tried to help me to help me .
And in this tat@@ too , I used to be able to talk back to me .
At the first time , I was 13 years old .
And I had to tell them about my friends , my friends , my friends , who said , &quot; &quot; My name is John Fr@@ anc@@ is , I &apos;ve told them , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go anymore .
What &apos;s happening in the future ?
( Laughter ) I would have had a time when I was able to go out and grab it .
But I had to tell you that I had to call it .
After two weeks , he &apos;d been trying to go into our fly .
So I &apos;ve learned a lot about this pattern — that &apos;s what we do .
He would tell me — I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know , I think it &apos;s the village of the tree of the tree .
Y@@ o@@ x , no . That &apos;s not — this is a user user .
It &apos;s the best one .
You can see if you &apos;re there .
Y@@ o@@ x , he talks about that choice .
So , it was a ner@@ d , and we did it .
I took it back to this work and say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve moved away .
But what I &apos;ve learned is something I &apos;ve learned . &quot; &quot; And when I show you a job , they made sure that I didn &apos;t have any meaning in theory that I didn &apos;t have to do .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t tell you , if you &apos;re a teacher , and if you don &apos;t tell yourself , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t tell you if you don &apos;t learn anything .
So , I d@@ anced .
I had to put it in the field , and he said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t take care of it . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t take care of it . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to drive .
What do you think to do with a Mag@@ ici@@ me degree ? &quot; &quot; I went to college , and I went to University University .
I &apos;d like to have a couple of years to write about what &apos;s going on .
He@@ ots of people would not be curious .
But something happened — Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ de@@ z .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a man who writ@@ es about what I &apos;ve written about in the U.S.
And it came back .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know what this is , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know what this happened .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; You need to put your cheese , because you &apos;re going to get better jobs . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I got my tea with innovation .
I went back to the Atlantic Ocean , and I went to the Atlantic Ocean , and I got my feet to the Atlantic Ocean , seven years and a day .
And in 199@@ 7 , I started to talk about the 20th century of the Sun .
And I &apos;ve been working on that , because when there is no man in the middle of the room , there &apos;s no man on the same time when there &apos;s no man on the floor .
And I thank you , and I thank you , because I had to thank you , and I thank you .
And this is the cele@@ bra@@ tion .
And they &apos;ve taught me to listen to me — they listened to me .
And that &apos;s something that I had to listen to .
There are really many — we need to listen to each other .
I was my journey .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is a joint . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t get this .
I &apos;ve been working on my fiel@@ d@@ ship , and I &apos;ve been doing the University of B@@ M@@ T@@ -@@ Sun@@ n@@ i .
I &apos;m writing for the United States for the United States — what &apos;s going on for the U.S.
If someone asked me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And what do you want to do ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I want to do differently . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go back to the middle of the middle of the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot; &quot; And then they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I &apos;m going to go through the sky . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you want to be different . &quot;
What is that ? What ?
How do you get to get different from what &apos;s going on in the market ?
It has been a wonderful shot of the way that we had to have a conversation .
And then — I went to the next year — I said , &quot; &quot; This is a year I &apos;m going to see another year . &quot; &quot; And I went to the next year , and I went to Car@@ aca@@ s , and I went to the United States .
And it turns out that I need to tell you why I started to talk to you .
I started to talk about my class , and I started to talk about it .
I &apos;ve learned that in the middle of this planet , I &apos;ve learned about the formula , but it &apos;s also a remarkable model .
And I had to learn about a remarkable surface — and I had to learn about what I learned about people .
And it &apos;s not because of the trees and birds and the birds , but not only in the educational landscape , and it &apos;s not just to look at all of us .
And if we don &apos;t do it , we can look around and see our behavior , and we can see each other &apos;s behavior .
And that was the name I wanted to make .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I have to go through this kind of theory , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have to put it in other words . &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got my own life , and I &apos;ve done it . &quot; &quot; And I came back to the Ven@@ ice .
This story is the result of that story , and I realized that I didn &apos;t have to use it .
I went around to the E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — who was known as a prison , and a bri@@ ck prison , and I didn &apos;t know what it was — Ven@@ ice , and I didn &apos;t .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; P@@ ha@@ sa@@ it@@ ate , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; P@@ ha@@ sa@@ it@@ ate , P@@ ha@@ sa@@ it@@ te , &quot; &quot; and the M@@ 16@@ -@@ 5@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary .
I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ sport ?
I &apos;m not in the middle of the show , I &apos;m not in the kitchen .
I &apos;m B@@ M@@ T S@@ cienti@@ st — a doctor Fr@@ anc@@ is , and I went around .
What did he say ?
And it came back to the future .
They didn &apos;t laugh .
I &apos;m going to go down and see what I &apos;m going to say , thank God I &apos;m going to die ?
And after 150 miles , I realized that I had been surrounded by a product , and I was surrounded by a product .
I was in prison , and I had to go out there .
But I didn &apos;t have to use the community in the middle of Africa .
What happens ?
Because when I started to use it , it would be like if you could use it to use it .
But the difference is that I &apos;ve always wanted to take care of myself , I don &apos;t want to take care of my feet from my feet .
I &apos;m not going to be the B@@ M@@ T S@@ cienti@@ st .
I &apos;m not going to be a professor .
And so I realized that I had another responsibility to change , and I had to change it .
You know , we can do it .
I was able to change the way I change .
And I had to change , because I &apos;ve always been told that I was always going to be moving .
Because I had to tell you that she didn &apos;t want the end .
I didn &apos;t know who I was .
But I could do it .
I could change it , because I &apos;m not here today .
And I know that we &apos;ve got to find ourselves in a place that we really want to take care of ourselves .
And we already have to put ourselves in an ar@@ ena , which we already had to have new identity , and we already have a new identity .
And what I &apos;d like to do is take you into the next panel , and I want to take you back to where you &apos;re going to take care of them , and that &apos;s the way that you can go out of the prison , which is that we need to do something .
We now need to change .
We need to be able to act as much as we call V@@ it@@ or P@@ re@@ tain .
And if my voice comes to you , if my voice says , &quot; &quot; If I want to tell you , if I &apos;ve ever experienced it .
I know , when I &apos;m here you &apos;re here , you can take some of you .
So , let &apos;s take this back to the world , and this is the world that we &apos;ve been able to take care of this , which is that we &apos;ve been able to put this thing in the world that we &apos;re going to share with each other , and we &apos;ve been able to put it in the world .
Because what we &apos;re seeing is our behavior , and our behavioral behavior is our behavior .
So I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m here to finish up with these five seconds , and I &apos;m going to finish here with five seconds .
Thank you . Thank you .

It turns out that in the United States , if you &apos;re in the United States , you zoom on on a chip , and I ask , &quot; Get it , this block is called ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; This is the O@@ ak of O@@ ak .
This is 2@@ 6@@ -@@ dig@@ it . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Good , good , what is this block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; You know , we don &apos;t have blocks . &quot;
There are issues , the blocks of blocks , not just for the gravitational end of the spectrum , &quot; &quot; he called a little bit of hair .
Now , if you &apos;re in the future , if you &apos;re in the middle of the world , you &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; &quot; You cook , this is what &apos;s called ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This is a block of 17@@ th , and that block is 16@@ th , &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; This is what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; C@@ Three ? &quot;
They have names .
Google Mis@@ sion . Here &apos;s 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , high-@@ line blocks .
All of these blocks are the names of these blocks . The tri@@ angles are called the &quot; &quot; ha@@ u@@ pers . &quot;
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; How do you do ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
And this is what you &apos;re going to say to 17 and a house , &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; When you ask , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t get home . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t get home . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of clu@@ bs .
The first one is the first of the first home of the first home .
And then the second is 2@@ ,@@ 2@@ - .
This is an archa@@ ic . It &apos;s an artist , and it &apos;s light . &quot; &quot; Now , I love it to see that we don &apos;t even think about what we &apos;re going to do to see if we don &apos;t really think about what we &apos;re going to do to see if we don &apos;t think about it .
For example , who &apos;s in Chinese who are in Chinese who are in the Chinese need to make you robust .
You &apos;ve got people who are right , and if you &apos;re sick , and if you &apos;re sick , if you &apos;re sick , you don &apos;t get any money , because they don &apos;t have to come out of their own business . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re always going to be when you &apos;re strong when you &apos;re weak .
( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) So we &apos;ve got a &quot; &quot; one . &quot; &quot; And one , two , three , four .
But in the West Africa , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a piece of music , &quot; &quot; which is the end of a sentence , is the end of a sentence .
So , just as you see it , it &apos;s not just about the limitations , but there &apos;s two , three , four , four .
And that map is true .
But there is a statement that you know about India , what you know , what you know about India .
So , if you don &apos;t forget about how ide@@ o@@ logically , you know , you know , you don &apos;t forget about what &apos;s going on in other places , and if you don &apos;t do anything .
Tom@@ o is the brow@@ n@@ ut . ( Applause ) Okay .
