Today I &apos;m not going to be obser@@ ving the Bible .
I &apos;m now working on the basis of technology .
And my little bit of insight is to take care of our little points of view .
So , you know , we have different resources for that .
This is a little video about what we &apos;ve done .
( Applause )
The pay@@ load can be a little bit .
( Laughter ) We were — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s the part of the video that I &apos;m going on — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s just — ( Laughter ) — that &apos;s the part of the video .
Y@@ o@@ x . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) Not that . ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The sun technology ...
Oh , what happened ?
Okay . Thank you .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to eat it .
After a few minutes , we &apos;ll go back to this . ( Laughter ) I hope that if you could have your body to get your body to your body , it will change your own life .
We &apos;re very interested in talking about language , which is very compelling .
The copyright is really curious about us : ( Laughter ) — and a smile , and a smile , and it &apos;s kind of like something else , and it &apos;s kind of like something else .
S@@ cienti@@ st : They get a 10-@@ minute home .
This is the best of the United States of America .
And when you &apos;re in the Arctic — Y@@ o@@ x . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
Let &apos;s memor@@ ize ourselves .
We dr@@ in@@ ks .
We &apos;re trying to be invisible to the guy .
As you can see , there are animals , and people do the same thing .
It turns out to be a strong and in@@ adver@@ s@@ ant .
We &apos;re going to be able to finish the ge@@ stures of their heads , we need to complete ge@@ stures .
It turns out , if somebody else is a person , we &apos;re trying to make sure that if we make a good answer , we &apos;re going to go .
In contrast , we &apos;re going to have the power .
Do you know why ?
And I realized that the M@@ BA authorities do a lot of ge@@ stures .
They &apos;re looking for a lot like a leader in the middle of the class , where they &apos;re going to go into the nutri@@ ent room , and they &apos;re going to be able to take care of it .
They &apos;re able to navigate with less than two grand@@ mothers .
They get rid of them .
They &apos;re less likely to be invisible .
They sit down as they sit down and get their hands .
For me , I took a couple of years .
The first is that you will not be able to make it .
It &apos;s been calcul@@ ated .
So , women become more likely to be able to take care of women .
They &apos;re more sus@@ cep@@ tible to people who are more vulnerable than people , and that &apos;s not the same .
And the teacher is hanging out .
And this is very important for the M@@ BA authorities , because in the opposite of them , they get paid .
And we can tell us that when we get young schools , they can &apos;t afford to trust .
And the people who are prepared to be successful in the middle of the middle , and the women who are at the end of the world are going to be engaged .
And I began to think about myself myself , so we can keep thinking about it as a result of more actors .
So if you want to show these videos , if you want to make these videos , do you want to make them more active ?
It wasn &apos;t going to be hard .
So what could you feel like if we &apos;re going to take care of ourselves in a sense of empo@@ wer@@ ment to change our behavior ?
Now , we can imagine , as we think about what &apos;s going on about us , and our mir@@ rors , and what we think about — there &apos;s a lot of milk .
But the question that we &apos;re interested in is giving us the question of what &apos;s important and the architect .
And we &apos;re going to have a tendency to take care of our own teeth among our teeth .
It turns out to be in both sides .
And in the power of power .
We have a tendency to see our streng@@ ths , and we have a tendency to see more power , and we have a tendency to make a lot better .
It doesn &apos;t change the way that we think we can &apos;t change our mobility , but not change .
In terms of the sense of beauty , what do I think we say ?
The idea of ideas and emotion , I call them the physi@@ ology of physics , and I &apos;ve got these hor@@ mon@@ es . I learn the hor@@ mon@@ es .
What do we think about things that are different ?
It &apos;s not a gam@@ bl@@ er , no exception .
And you say , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t think about two minutes . &quot;
And we can play the game with them .
They chose the game that the game plays the game .
And the 60 percent of the people in power are 60 percent of them . That &apos;s more important .
And this is the test we &apos;ve got in the test .
And in the same way , 20 percent of people have a tendency to take care of the people from the moment , 20 percent of the people who are at the heart of the day .
I have two minutes of change in two minutes .
And there are some people in fear .
With 25 percent of the cor@@ tical pollen in power , 25 percent of them became 15 percent , and then 15 percent .
I think we have two minutes to make sure that our brains are more ambitious and more comfortable than our brains and comfortable making sense .
This is the sense of our rights .
We don &apos;t think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about it .
Our body changes our way .
The next question that we &apos;re interested in is the question of why we don &apos;t take care of a few minutes of accuracy , a few minutes to change our lives .
This is a two-@@ minute axis of two minutes .
Why do you re@@ imagine that in re@@ gener@@ ative life ?
Of course , that &apos;s what makes us really interesting .
Now , these poll@@ ut@@ ants may be used to be applied to social education .
Are we honest ?
For innovation , it &apos;s the equivalent table .
Some of them are in these schools .
Some of them are going to take care of it , or it &apos;s a business interview .
Now , we &apos;ve got a lot of people interested in business , because many of you have experienced this .
So we &apos;ve talked about our tap@@ e@@ stry , med@@ it@@ ators , and they said , &quot; &quot; What do we want to do is we have to do that ? &quot;
( Laughter ) You know , we den@@ sed this idea . Y@@ o@@ x ! We don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t do it .
That &apos;s not your heads .
Your essence is three .
What do you do before you start ?
You sit on it . You &apos;re looking at it .
You &apos;re looking at your rituals , the band@@ width , your essence , you &apos;re not going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; And what you &apos;re going to do is look like this .
That &apos;s what we want to do .
And then they went through the lap@@ tops , and after that , after all , they had a great business interview , and after all of re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ation , they had a very familiar business interview .
And five minutes later , five minutes later .
They &apos;ve been taught to take care of the impact of the galaxy in order to take care of the impact of the galaxy , and they look at them .
It &apos;s much more concrete than just to look at the five minutes in order to look at it .
Nobody likes that .
Mar@@ i@@ an La@@ Fr@@ ance call this &quot; &quot; soci@@ alization . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s how it grows in human@@ i@@ ties .
We &apos;d like them to see the data we had to see .
And then we went to the commit@@ tee , and we took four of these bat@@ ters .
They &apos;re not going to be the news of the audience .
The guy who &apos;s got a little bit of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy , &quot; &quot; We want to take these things out of the video . &quot; &quot; And then , &quot; &quot; We want to take these things out to work . &quot; &quot; And they showed up on the video .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to take these things out .
And then they get more positive . &quot; &quot; But what does it mean ?
This is not because of them .
They &apos;re connected to their n@@ esses .
In other words , we &apos;d like to see how many of them are going to be in the middle of it ?
Which is what ?
This is no difference in the world .
This is what we &apos;ve been seeing .
People would only show the sun .
So they made the self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em .
They &apos;ve had no impact on their ideas .
This is the factor of why .
And when I say to people , we think we think about our body , our behavior , our behavior , our behavior can change our future .
Let me tell you how much as I could have before .
&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t .
But I don &apos;t want to give you a feeling .
I don &apos;t want to be there .
I don &apos;t want to have a family . &quot;
I &apos;m very good at getting these words . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have to sell to you , and I want to talk to you a little story about a little story .
In 19 years old , I had a lot of heavy hunting .
It was going to desert .
I was surrounded by a couple of times .
And I had to re@@ construct a prescrip@@ tion , and I had to go back to the reha@@ b , and I had to go back and forth , and I had the same article that I had answered , and I got the I@@ Q sky down . It was very painful for me .
I was lucky , because I was known as a kid , and I was known as a kid .
Because I had to go back to the cou@@ ch , trying to return .
They came to me : &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish .
And what you can find is a lot of things , but there &apos;s no cou@@ ch . &quot; &quot; And I started to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to get any of you . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell you that you don &apos;t know anything about it .
I &apos;ve been deli@@ ghted to make myself miserable .
I used to work , I worked , and I worked on my own , and I was able to tackle my own stories .
I ended up with my arm .
I had to go back to four years , and I had to go back to the United States for four years , and the S@@ us@@ an F@@ re@@ mb@@ ai , who was the S@@ us@@ an F@@ re@@ mb@@ ai , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not an A@@ id I &apos;m not an A@@ id . &quot; &quot; So I was like , &quot; I don &apos;t have an A@@ id . &quot;
I was doing it .
The first 20 minutes in Pr@@ in@@ st@@ st@@ en is the first one of 20 minutes in the United States .
I think it was in fact .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to go .
So , you &apos;ll go and tell you , you know , I &apos;m going to get you and I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s also .
You &apos;re going to make all the things that you need .
And if you don &apos;t listen to the world , you would like to see if you don &apos;t listen to your body , if you don &apos;t listen to your body .
You &apos;re going to go ahead and say , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re going to go . &quot; &quot; And so I did .
I &apos;m reading about five years old , and I &apos;m a couple of years that I &apos;m Nor@@ th@@ we@@ gi@@ m , I &apos;m Nor@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n@@ ni@@ k , in Harvard , I &apos;m working on it . I &apos;m going to work on it . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t think that in this bar , I &apos;m not my place , but I &apos;m not sure that it &apos;s not my place .
At the end of the first year , at the end of the first year , when I was in Harvard , I didn &apos;t talk to you about the time I said , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t want to go back , you &apos;re not going to be able to cry . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know it well .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my place for my hometown , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; This is not my place . &quot;
That &apos;s my return .
Because two things happened .
First , I realized that I &apos;d like to go back .
But he was feeling , and the feeling of my life .
And the second is that I had to understand that it was right .
So , he would have to wear it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; No , that &apos;s the right thing .
I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be able to show the essence of the golf cart , and you &apos;ll show your essence , and you &apos;re going to be able to make the best sh@@ are@@ hol@@ der , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you the best . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what he &apos;s sitting here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A couple of months later , he came to me , and I saw that she was sitting
It was changed .
And I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you
Have you ever tried to train .
So let me show you how much you want to do .
You know , I &apos;m sick .
Now , some of us can make these great changes .
Now , here &apos;s two minutes that I said .
Two minutes , two minutes .
When you &apos;re going to be rewar@@ ded , you &apos;re going to have two minutes before you &apos;re going to be rewar@@ ded , trying to do that . L@@ i@@ ri@@ cal , in the prison room , in the middle of the room , in the middle of the table .
Have you ever wanted it .
Re@@ view your brain is going to take care of the best .
You increase your diagnosis . You cut your fear .
Don &apos;t show them what I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t show them that I &apos;m not going to show them that I am . &quot;
You &apos;ll see , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have to tell you who I am , and I &apos;m going to show them . &quot;
You don &apos;t have to take those vibra@@ tions from you , and I want to share it with the others , because that &apos;s very simple .
This is not excl@@ usive — ( Laughter ) — you know what you &apos;re learning about , and the people who are able to benefit this study , because we can see what &apos;s going on to the technology and the re@@ per@@ to@@ ire , and what we do are people who are not quali@@ fied to do with technology .
You know , you know , you know , you can use it .
Because they can afford to have two minutes to feed their bodies to life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have a lot of movement .
It &apos;s the closest you can see among their super@@ power .
For example , these are the things that we have to do to live in order to live to live to live .
And they came from a lot of people who had lost the conflict of the conflict of the conflict in the conflict .
B@@ at@@ dor@@ sts who are giving all the damage for all the rights benefit for all rights , but it doesn &apos;t thank them . Thank you .
Here is a 90 percent of the product of the product , the 90 percent of the product .
Most of the heroes are working for a lot of years , and they go out of tri@@ ang@@ ies , and in order to get back to the world .
Kar@@ ro@@ ols are cars from a couple of thousands of years , and they &apos;re cars who are prepared to go through metal , and they &apos;re going to be able to go back and forth , and they &apos;re going to have the audience .
This is what I &apos;ve had to meet with those questions that had been involved in this .
I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m a poli@@ ce@@ man , politics of politics and politics .
In 2009 , I &apos;ve conver@@ ted the rul@@ ing of my job in the middle of every year in my life .
But this time I went to a dru@@ d@@ gery .
And I had to make my work more worried about art and har@@ mony , and it would help bring these ca@@ ter@@ pill@@ ars to get into the middle center .
These days , these days , in the press and social med@@ al .
And I think that I &apos;ve been obsessed with this world with this world that I &apos;ve been working on .
I had a lot of clu@@ ster@@ ed in the snow , and I had a lot of pes@@ si@@ mi@@ sts in the world , and I had to go back and forth .
And I came back to the idea that they don &apos;t have to see the patterns with the invisible objects .
And in the Archi@@ me@@ des , I came to see them in the Pacific Africa , in China , in China , in China , in Turkey .
And then I realized that more people have to have more people and more people , because it was big .
After that , I created a movement under the title of P@@ at@@ ro@@ tea .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s a great movement , &quot; &quot; and it was a great movement that was designed by the way to help the ro@@ pes and the tiles .
A@@ re@@ dor@@ sts , who are people , st@@ ole the st@@ alls , lo@@ gging hair , sal@@ sters , mar@@ gin@@ alized therap@@ ists and who were known as this as well .
It was the same as being created by our k@@ ro@@ aches , the car@@ ro@@ ters , and the people who would have been unable to make any sense of plac@@ e@@ stry , to see if they had no access to the people who were going to rain .
They would take another argument for dis@@ agreement : they have a concrete , and they laugh .
And finally , it would be part of the audience , and it would be part of the world that would be part of the world .
And Sa@@ o Pa@@ ul@@ o , Sa@@ o Pa@@ ul@@ o , Rio de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ e@@ ir@@ o .
But in order to be able to deal with the people who are in the middle of a year , we &apos;ve created the P@@ hy@@ ph@@ it@@ i , the first thing that we &apos;ve been able to deal with , which is designed by a TED@@ x , created the P@@ hy@@ ph@@ x , created the P@@ hy@@ ph@@ x , created a P@@ hy@@ ph@@ x .
So , it could be a girl .
In two years , 1@@ 70 catal@@ y@@ sters and 200 clu@@ ster@@ ed and 200 cu@@ bic meters , and we got up with the 10@@ 0@@ 0-@@ pound don@@ or , and it was in the middle schools .
We would have been able to put in the sky as we went to go to the invisible , and they would have been given up .
They could be able to come up with their eyes , and they could grow up , and they could raise their income and their communities .
Now , here I &apos;m going to tell you how to find the ca@@ ter@@ pill@@ ars and the invisible questions in your life .
You try to see a whole lot without sp@@ ous@@ es .
You don &apos;t want to believe it , there are over 20 million clu@@ bs in the world .
To her , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Mu@@ it@@ o or@@ bia , thank you .
( Applause )
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , in 199@@ 7 , 199@@ 7 , 199@@ 7 , 199@@ 7 or a half of the University of Chicago , the University of Y@@ el@@ v@@ is Me@@ ir , the leader of the Y@@ u@@ q@@ i Institute , the leader of the M@@ ax@@ es Institute .
Now , the idea of the word # No@@ ber@@ berg was un@@ thin@@ kable before , with other people , with other people , with other medi@@ ums , with other medi@@ ums , the people who were in the middle of the middle of the world : the people , the flies , and the rul@@ ers of B@@ M@@ T@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@ -@@ T@@
The plans were made by the F@@ T@@ B .
But it turns out that in 199@@ 3 , in 199@@ 3 , the World Tra@@ de M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine couldn &apos;t take a bomb .
In the last hundred years , the No@@ ora was known .
It &apos;s my father &apos;s father No@@ sell .
And in 198@@ 3 , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , was a proud teacher , and I had an epi@@ ph@@ any , and I had an epi@@ ph@@ any , and I was able to take care of the world to be able to live school to live school .
After the age of seven years old age started changing .
And I didn &apos;t want to see my name as many Muslims , many Muslims , so many Muslims , so many Muslims , so many Muslims .
But I &apos;ve learned about these things , and when people know about each other , it doesn &apos;t really take a long time when we know that every one of us has always been the same as the rest of our life .
In every single religion , in every single religion , in every single religious world , people who have a tendency to believe that they have a tendency to take care of their own lives , and their heads , they have a tendency to make their own life .
I think that a couple of months ago , a couple of months ago , a couple of months ago , in the London of London , a few weeks ago , he told me that he had to go back to the police in London .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to him .
We went to Cal@@ tr@@ y@@ ton Air@@ port , and we didn &apos;t know that the Minister of F@@ T@@ B@@ -@@ head was in the secret .
He would help me to hire my students to join me in my de@@ af@@ ening , and how about 30 me@@ ets n@@ ick@@ ening , and how to deal with it .
The last laugh that I jumped on was the last laugh that I jumped on today , and the last laugh that I jumped on was the last laugh . Ha@@ wn that , I think .
The other guy said , &quot; &quot; I@@ ri@@ sh a@@ bu@@ h , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is the bat@@ ch of his name . &quot;
This is the word &quot; &quot; ha@@ u@@ l , &quot; &quot; and after a few years , I actually understood what they were laughing .
They thought they saw what my father had had .
And these people would have been involved in 700 milli@@ meters in the middle of the middle of the world , the average World Tra@@ il of the World Tra@@ de M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine Act , which is why we &apos;ve been able to tackle six people in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the world , and they &apos;ve been able to take care of the deaths from the &apos; 60s .
And these people have taken me to take care of myself .
&quot; &quot; Un@@ cle my uncle . &quot; &quot; People I call .
We &apos;ve changed our lives 20 times as long as I was 19 years old , and I &apos;ve been able to make this change for my kids .
Some of us would have a tendency to be able to feel better if I had to feel better .
And as a new one , I was always struck by kids , as I was in the nervous .
I would like to take care of my identity in the middle center , to be in the middle of the crowd , and this is what happened to be the first time in which religion was the most s@@ ounding and the ball of the first time .
That &apos;s why I &apos;d like to read so many parts of my time reading books , and I &apos;d like to watch the book and play games .
And I wasn &apos;t ready for that soci@@ ologist , and I wasn &apos;t prepared for that , as if I was a lifel@@ ong father , I wasn &apos;t prepared for life .
I grew up in a world where people and religion , like religion and religion .
What led me to my eyes ?
One of my first interviews is that one of the first interviews that I had to take care of is a year ago , 2001 , a year ago .
When I was in the University of University of University of University , in the U.K. , in the U.K.
I had a team of compla@@ ints between the people who I was in the train , and the way that I had to compla@@ in about a lot of life , as someone who would have to compla@@ int about the fact that I didn &apos;t exist , I didn &apos;t exist .
People had a different type of life for our ru@@ pe@@ es .
I learned that one of the kids that I was deli@@ ghted in the last days was that one of the kids I had friends were .
This is a couple of days , but it &apos;s been hungry , but I &apos;ve come to realize that among our two of us who don &apos;t think that I don &apos;t have a deal .
I had no idea that my friend was not , and I had to tell you , I had a sense that I knew that I had no idea that I had to make sure that my life was un@@ thin@@ kable .
One more champ@@ i@@ on@@ ship of literature happened in the W@@ M@@ ich Gar@@ ner Gar@@ den of Bu@@ s@@ ch Gar@@ den .
And I was in the presence of people who had different stories , and that was the same role in people who had different stories .
I &apos;ve been told that I had all the time that I was in the history of hom@@ os@@ ex@@ uality , and I had all the ge@@ e@@ ks , and I had all the ge@@ other@@ mal implications .
And it turns out that I &apos;ve got a lot of work , and I &apos;ve been able to make a lot of work , and I &apos;ve been able to have a lot of people who have never seen that as much as many people as they &apos;ve ever seen .
It &apos;s a feeling that I don &apos;t want to tell you about , as I &apos;m very gay , as if I was very gay , as if I was very gay , I would like to tell you that I don &apos;t want to be able to make sure that I don &apos;t want to tell myself , and I don &apos;t want to tell myself about myself .
In my sense of this sense , I would like to tell you that I was a kid who was taught me from a kid who was a kid who was talking to me .
I &apos;m not going to tell you about what I &apos;m going to be , because I &apos;m not going to tell you about what I &apos;m going to be doing .
And then , &quot; &quot; The D@@ il@@ ey S@@ ho@@ w &quot; &quot; came to be honest about my obs@@ ession with my obs@@ ession , and I had to tell you that the human race was not to be honest with me , and it helped me to tell me that the human race was not associated with the pleasure of the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
C@@ on S@@ to@@ aster , who I need to take care of art in terms of art .
The inspiration came out of nowhere , and I had to show my world@@ view to my world@@ view , which I had to show my world@@ view in which my world@@ view would have more positive .
One day , I had a conversation about my mother , and my mother told me about the way that my mother had been in my lifetime .
My mother looked at me with my family , and he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to do that . &quot; &quot; And he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to go . &quot;
I understood how much time I could talk to you about the quanti@@ tative feeling in the literature .
Well , my E@@ bra@@ my E@@ bra@@ my is not exciting .
I &apos;ve changed my father &apos;s relationship to my father &apos;s relationship to my father &apos;s relationship to my father .
And why would I say , why would we go ?
It &apos;s crazy .
And I think that if I think about it , I &apos;m going to tell my story about my stories , and I don &apos;t think that if I don &apos;t think about it , I don &apos;t think that if we don &apos;t want to think about it , I didn &apos;t want to be pros@@ ecu@@ ted , I didn &apos;t have a pros@@ ecu@@ tor .
At the end , I chose to use my life as a tool in terms of terrorism , and I &apos;ve chosen to use it as tools .
I hope that these ter@@ atri@@ sts and their statistics have experienced that they live in love with them , and I &apos;m sorry .
And I &apos;m going to tell you that if I don &apos;t want to take the cor@@ ri@@ dor of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , I &apos;m going to take care of my father &apos;s movement .
As I heard , I &apos;m a vivi@@ d fan of my emotions , and I &apos;m alive , and I &apos;m alive , and I &apos;m living alive in the way that the boy has not been in the middle of the boy .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Have you ever done it !
O@@ ther@@ wise ?
They took the name of my name , and I wanted to ask you to ask , &quot; &quot; What do I want to ask you to do here ? &quot; &quot; So , what do we call ?
Any@@ body ? Who ? There &apos;s no problem .
One day ago , a day ago , I sat down with my friend , and I ran out .
I looked at the office , and I said , &quot; What you have ? &quot;
He looked at me and thought about the word &quot; &quot; good@@ bye &quot; &quot; ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you ? ( English ) &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Why do they tell him ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No matter . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Great , come on . &quot; &quot; He said .
He would tell me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t talk to me . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; If we were the best part of this world in this world , I wouldn &apos;t look at it . &quot;
Have you ever said the word &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sion &quot; &quot; ?
My husband has a little bit of feedback , and it made me the same as a mos@@ que .
How do we talk about that ?
I started thinking about it .
That led me .
This is really what the man &apos;s worth .
In my own country , they don &apos;t consider that in my country .
Is it something else ?
How do we go ?
But as we are here , there are so many men who are in their own life , and they &apos;re very good for them to say , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re very good at all the things that have ever done , but they &apos;re not just the same as they &apos;re doing .
Have you forgotten my ideas , my ideas , my ideas , my mouth and the other ?
What we could do is we could have the best people in the middle of a month ?
And I looked at everything I learned in Arabic .
Should I forget to be one of them ?
What is it ?
Now , if we look at all these things , I tried to understand it .
I didn &apos;t want to tell him that he had to fight me .
This is the language of the Bible .
It &apos;s not the language of science , and it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;re used to do , and we &apos;re used to have a broad project that we &apos;re used to do in the universities we &apos;re used to do , not in language .
If we did it , they would call our palm .
But what do I do when I &apos;m going to use my wish ?
You don &apos;t want to use the Arabic language . What do we do ?
This is a re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
But there &apos;s another re@@ per@@ to@@ ire that we have to think about .
It &apos;s the language language .
In Arabic , we &apos;re saying that in other languages , we need to be Muslims in other languages .
In fact , in other languages , in other languages , we can make ideas to express ideas .
What ?
C@@ ari@@ b@@ ran X@@ i@@ do@@ l was the first time to start writing in Arabic .
His whole ideas , the imagination of the imagination , the imagination of the imagination , the imagination of the imagination , the first one in the village .
So he started writing in English as he started writing about it .
Even in English , in English , when he wrote his writing in English , you &apos;ll feel like , you get the feeling of life .
You can imagine , in English , in English , in the Li@@ van , is my son &apos;s son .
This is an architect that &apos;s never going to talk .
Secondly , if you want to kill a nation , if you want to kill a nation , if you want to kill a nation , it means to kill his tongue .
This is a re@@ per@@ to@@ ire that we have experienced .
The Ger@@ mans , fu@@ tures , are the f@@ reck@@ les — these nations are different differently .
Now , they make their own language of their own language .
They put it in the context .
Now , they &apos;re using a lot of money in the language that they use to make language .
More or more ?
Well , what we did was we wanted to go from the world from the world , and we wanted to think about it , and we wanted to make the rest of the world .
And in a time , for the same time , there were a lot of people who were like , &quot; &quot; Pe@@ ace , Th@@ u@@ z@@ zy , &quot; &quot; and the countries like Turkey , Mal@@ ala , Mal@@ aw@@ i and etc . , countries like that , they had the same language as they did .
They kept talking about language .
Because if you take a product from Turkey and another place from another place , and if you don &apos;t have a vaccine , it &apos;s not a domestic product .
You couldn &apos;t believe it was the native product .
They &apos;re used as early before , as we are thinking about it as we &apos;ve been thinking about it .
So they got their own language to innov@@ ate and want to be able to innov@@ ate .
If I say , &quot; &quot; A@@ ambi@@ a , citiz@@ en@@ ship , citiz@@ en@@ ship , citiz@@ en@@ ship . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s going on .
Who is , how , and why is it .
We don &apos;t have to deal with the next generation of words , not to quali@@ fy to deal .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ es , which is our lives , the opposite of our lives , and the term that &apos;s connected to our ecosystems .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Ad@@ ur@@ ity , citiz@@ en@@ ship , citiz@@ en@@ ship , citiz@@ en@@ ship , &quot; &quot; all of you have experienced images in the history of literature .
It &apos;s not about two or three or three words .
And that &apos;s how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about each other , how the other people see us ?
What is the Bible ?
You can say , what is this people falling down , not ?
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; A@@ ambi@@ a , citiz@@ en@@ ship , citiz@@ en@@ ship , Muslim , Muslim . &quot; &quot; And if you go back to your age , &quot; &quot; A@@ da , you know ? &quot;
How do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , it &apos;s good for me , and I don &apos;t talk to you .
This is what I mean , the expression of these phr@@ ases is something that we do .
I have a fu@@ z@@ zy friend who &apos;s married to me .
I asked him , how do they work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , everything is good . But I &apos;m trying to tell you that one day I &apos;m going to talk about the word &quot; &quot; to@@ we@@ l . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The wrong thing is to go back to the morning .
His name was the essential nature that said , &quot; &quot; How can the human ? &quot;
Is he wanting suicide ?
&quot; &quot; B@@ asse@@ l me ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s one of a few mir@@ rors .
And so we started thinking about that , because we don &apos;t want to deal with it , and we don &apos;t want to deal with it , and then it &apos;s right . It &apos;s very different .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , I have to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell you that when I listen to my team , I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do when I listen to F@@ ob@@ by@@ ies , when I listen to F@@ ob@@ by@@ ies , when I listen to F@@ ob@@ by@@ ies , when I listen to what I &apos;m going to listen to . &quot;
Let me tell you about this .
( Applause ) But what did you do to see the Arabic language ?
We &apos;ve started to apply it to the public sector , and we started campaig@@ ning in Arabic .
Now , a lot of people would say , &quot; &quot; Why would you call ?
This is the head@@ ache , and for example . &quot; &quot; There is no problem !
This is the gift of the interview champ@@ ions campaign : &quot; When I tell you , I &apos;m talking to you from the Bible . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ o@@ x ! We don &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose that , because we didn &apos;t have to deal with that way .
And when I tell you , when I talk to you , when I talk to you .
We say , ( Applause ) We want to change our own re@@ perceptions and our aspi@@ rations , our aspi@@ rations , our aspi@@ rations .
We &apos;re going to have to go back and think about the way we think .
So , &quot; &quot; When I talk to you , I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you from the Bible . &quot;
And so far , it &apos;s a creative and faith .
And after that , we started another campaign written on the city .
You don &apos;t see that , you don &apos;t see that , you don &apos;t have a vir@@ gin , and you don &apos;t have to get it . &quot;
Why ? It &apos;s really , really , to kill the language .
We need to kill our diet .
If we were to kill our diet , we had to find our identity .
We had to find it .
We had to go back to the beginning .
This is not serious , and it &apos;s not serious , and it &apos;s not serious .
And after that , we went around and we ran out of the sky .
&quot; &quot; C@@ ol &quot; &quot; and the images of boys .
Thank you very much .
And who said , &quot; &quot; A@@ ha , you &apos;ve talked about English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Y@@ o@@ x ! &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Y@@ o@@ x ! I &apos;m the word . &quot; &quot; Now , let me tell you , what do you do . But let me tell you , let me tell you , you have better expression .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I go back to the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t hurt . We need to cheat ourselves .
But we need to believe that if we think about it , we need to believe that if we think about it , we need to figure out what &apos;s going on , and we need to figure out what &apos;s going on .
The ide@@ als are the ide@@ als .
If we can fly in the ca@@ bin , and we don &apos;t know , we can make a creative person , and then we can be creative .
You know , all of you are a creative project .
Your mother is a path@@ way in your language .
Let &apos;s start from that moment .
We &apos;ve got a novel film , or a short movie .
One novel can do global .
This is the Arabic language that makes it happen .
You don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; No way , no way to say , &quot; &quot; no longer wait .
But we need to believe that there is no way , and we have to believe that there &apos;s a part of the way that we &apos;re the pi@@ pe of it .
What do you do today ?
T@@ scre@@ w , who is tra@@ iler ?
When I was a while , I &apos;d like to ask you very much about you , when I think about you , in English , in English .
But don &apos;t write it up in Arabic , in Arabic , in Arabic .
( Applause ) This is a disaster ! This is not language !
You get a viral language with the virus .
It &apos;s not easy if it &apos;s not easy .
This is what we can do .
Secondly , we have many other things that we can do .
We &apos;ve never been able to put each other in here today .
We &apos;re here to put this language in the middle of the country .
Now , I &apos;m opening you up .
The first time it comes to the sky for the first time in language .
My daughter is born , and I &apos;m going to tell him , &quot; &quot; This is the picture of the sky . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure English . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m glad to say , &quot; &quot; T@@ emotion is a dy@@ e , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tell him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to say Ma@@ man , Ma@@ man , Ma@@ man . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say Ma@@ man , Ma@@ man ,
( Applause ) Let &apos;s take our essence . ( Applause )
So a couple of years ago , this is an American philosopher M@@ organ F@@ ur@@ ald M@@ organ , where you see the U.S.
I &apos;ve learned a couple of things about these 30 days .
It became more and more likely to find the months of the month .
For me , I took a picture every day .
And before I started 30 days , before we started to have 30 days of tests , before I started to go back to 30 days .
I learned that I had a team of young people .
By the way , it &apos;s not the way that it &apos;s going to do a daily basis .
But you &apos;ll finish the rocket .
It &apos;s a lot .
I &apos;m not in the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m con@@ spir@@ acy . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not in the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a computer . &quot;
I can say , if I want to ask , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m writing . &quot;
And I learned that when I was very small , I had to be able to take care of them .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
The first day I started college and optimi@@ zed with our op@@ tics .
I was very good at my school , and I was able to take care of my eyes with my eyes , and I started to experience a lifel@@ ong experience of the journey .
This is a remarkable image , which is a very compelling picture , and a very compelling picture , which is a very compelling picture .
And in the class , I had a lot of attention , and I had a feeling that I had a tendency to make a sense of pleasure , and I had a sense of the vo@@ y@@ age in my future .
But I had learned to hide these countries .
It was so compelling that it was so compelling that it was so compelling that I was able to end up in the world . And I did not have the first pros@@ the@@ tics , the first thing I did .
I was like , as I did earlier , as I did earlier , I was like , &quot; &quot; You know , when I &apos;ve done the first time , I &apos;ve been talking about my wife . &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah , it &apos;s a hotel .
No , no , no matter who , I &apos;ve been fascinated by the spirit of the Bible .
In S@@ ar@@ ti@@ zing , the books were going on to the pilot .
He said , &quot; &quot; He opens the door . &quot;
This was a prime minister .
And before I talk about everything , I &apos;ve talked about everything , and just days before I &apos;ve talked about everything .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s not . &quot;
S@@ cientists , sal@@ ty , and even a princi@@ pal , a friend of mine , and I had the idea that I had no idea of giving any of these sa@@ ints , which I had to say , I don &apos;t have to give any of the comman@@ ds .
For me , when I was in the middle of the world , I was able to take care of what I was , and I had to hide my life .
I was unable to call me any more or less , but I felt that my command , I was working on my command , and I was working on my command .
I said , &quot; &quot; I d@@ anced in my relationship , and I &apos;ve got a lot .
And it turns out that the ordinary people would come up with this idea : the normal people don &apos;t matter and I don &apos;t know .
The sun started to come up with a little bit . And I had to figure out who was , who was , who I had to do , and I had the second largest journey .
Col@@ li@@ c who I &apos;ve photographed in Col@@ ing .
And what I &apos;d like to do is I saw the minimum wage , and I &apos;d like to tell myself , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;ve got a sense of what I &apos;m passionate about . &quot; &quot; And as we say , &quot; &quot; Well , I think it &apos;s true that I &apos;m going to take care of myself .
I needed this mar@@ ch and help , and I started to talk to him .
Now , the sky is to me .
I was gui@@ ded to the psychologist , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to look at everything that I &apos;m saying in the middle of the Bible .
For me , I used to work like the ap@@ ples of campus in the middle of the middle of the campus , and when I was in the middle of the middle of the campus , who would say , &quot; &quot; I want to go .
I have to read the news in 6@@ -@@ da news news . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have to read it .
After that , it started to take care of my family .
I was struck by what I was struck by , and then he had to put it in schizophren@@ ia , and then it came to me : the name of me and the future , a sense of dis@@ agreement .
And I &apos;m sure that I had an epi@@ ph@@ any life , and I had to believe that I had a product that I had a product to believe that I had a product .
Now , this was the equivalent of a tendency to see , in fact , in the middle of this network , a typical psychi@@ atri@@ st , and the dragonflies began to grow up , and the dragonflies start to go .
I &apos;m not going to tell you , I &apos;m a n@@ ick@@ ening world in my world , and I &apos;m a little dru@@ m in my world .
In terms of course , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to agree that I &apos;m going to agree that I &apos;m going to help them to change my life and change my life .
The forces of je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy tap@@ e@@ sts , as you can see in terms of the millen@@ ni@@ als , the more equ@@ als , and then they &apos;ve got a dramatic tap@@ e@@ stry , and for example , they have a dramatic tap@@ e@@ stry : &quot; What do you see ?
Do you see the star of water ?
I &apos;ve been on the top of the face of the family , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve done it , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve done .
In the same time , I was able to make the opposite , the opposite , the truth , the vi@@ sc@@ eral and the in@@ vi@@ sibility of the in@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te , and I had no power to create sul@@ fur and peace .
And two years later , it started to launch .
And I &apos;ve been obsessed with all of the girls who are in the middle of the whole world : a strange sound , not to deal with attention .
It &apos;s a catal@@ o@@ tic discri@@ mination for discri@@ mination , a voca@@ bul@@ ary , education , a catal@@ o@@ gl@@ er for the laws of physics , and I psycho@@ logists , and I psycho@@ logists : it &apos;s more comfortable than that schizophren@@ ia . &quot; &quot; The next thing was , I wanted to get my heads better than that schizophren@@ ia .
Now , when we look at the early world , the first of the inspiration and the illusion of a difference , I think , is a difference .
It led to a sho@@ ot@@ er and a sho@@ e , and it was the same thing that I had to be scan@@ ned , and then the end of it came back to one thing that I had to be scan@@ ned .
I had a lot of people who were shooting up to me , and I was in my prison , and they were very upset with people who had helped me with people who had helped me .
The other thing that I &apos;ve been doing is that I &apos;ve got another left , and my partner , and my partner , and my partner , and I have to believe that when I think about it , I think it &apos;s only about the most important time in which I &apos;m going to take care of it , and I think it &apos;s only about the most important time that I &apos;m going to take care of it , and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to go back to it .
I believe , E@@ an@@ or is going to press this .
And when we are in the monkey , it &apos;s an exc@@ es@@ sive bow . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have 14 minutes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 14 minutes , and I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to thank you . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t want to thank you in 14 minutes .
But they came back to the United States , and they came back to my soul .
I &apos;d like to tell you what I &apos;ve had to do , and the best one , I think , is that I had to deal with some of the things that I had to deal with when I had to deal with something that I wasn &apos;t always aware of , and I realized that I didn &apos;t know that I was going to deal with those questions , and I didn &apos;t know that I had those memories , but I didn &apos;t know that I had those memories .
Of course , earlier , earlier , earlier , before they came back , we had to believe that before they came back , I had to learn about it as much as the first time in front of my first year .
For the time , I &apos;ve learned to tell you about a sense of what I &apos;m going to do with you , not as much as a re@@ per@@ to@@ ire — not as much as the re@@ per@@ to@@ ire or the education I &apos;ve had , and the feeling of education and education .
I believed in them .
I &apos;ve been sitting in the prison of my vag@@ u@@ books , and I &apos;ve been able to tell you that I &apos;ve just calcul@@ ated them in the middle of my apartment , and I &apos;ve just had these stories .
Because there was a lot of young people in my home who had been in the middle of the middle , because we had a lot of young people in the middle of the room , and we were sitting in the crowd .
You don &apos;t have to be sure .
You can &apos;t see if you can &apos;t see it ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say .
And then I &apos;ve got a lot of information out of the words that I &apos;m secre@@ ting in the words of the words that I &apos;ve been secre@@ ting in the words that I had to do with them , because I had to thank you , because I had to thank you , because I had to give them a sense of how to give you a sense of how to re@@ invest in the world .
So let &apos;s sell the strings to the chip , and I started to give them a lot of people , and I started to make sure that we care about how to deal with it .
I &apos;ve learned that all of these things that I never had ever been able to solve , and I &apos;ve learned that all of this sudden , I &apos;ve learned that all of these things that I &apos;ve never been able to solve , and I &apos;ve learned that I &apos;ve been able to take care of the min@@ ority .
S@@ cientists have been struck by these bats , and I &apos;ve discovered that the dragonflies are actually going to be the most important , and the dragonflies that are going to come back to the beginning , and I &apos;ve discovered that the dragonflies are going on .
And after that , after that , what was the result of the group that struck me as a result of what struck me was that I had to take care of the literature from the literature , and I went back to psycho@@ analy@@ st , and I went back to psycho@@ analy@@ st .
Ten years after the first time , 10 years later , when I was talking about psychi@@ atri@@ st in psychi@@ atri@@ st psychology in psychology , I had no idea . And then a year later — a year later — a year later .
And one of the things that happened to me is that when I was at im@@ peri@@ sed .
I &apos;m going to take my head out of the needle .
As O@@ s@@ car said , the O@@ s@@ car said .
At the time , you could listen to two sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers .
I &apos;ve been working on my health care literature , and I &apos;m going to try and play the book , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that the most important question is that what &apos;s wrong with psycho@@ logically ?
And I learned that I had to live with all these institutions that I listen to , and I &apos;ve learned about the fact that it &apos;s going to take care of them .
I could help others find the most important thing that I &apos;d like to take care of , and I could help others .
This is what I &apos;m going to call the &quot; &quot; H@@ ope of D@@ om@@ al@@ em , &quot; &quot; which is the equivalent of the En@@ viron@@ ment of the Emp@@ ire Emp@@ om@@ muni@@ tions of the H@@ osp@@ ital , and Dr. S@@ a E@@ sch@@ l , and Dr. S@@ a E@@ sch@@ l , and Dr. S@@ anz@@ a E@@ sch@@ er workers , who are going to take care of what &apos;s going on .
We don &apos;t want to know that if you need to take care of people and understanding the people who need to have their dignity on the sky .
It &apos;s possible that it &apos;s possible that it is possible , and it &apos;s going to be on the scale .
Now , there is a phrase that Che@@ e@@ z@@ h has read , if social change is starting to change .
It &apos;s not going to play the poor person .
It &apos;s not going to make people who don &apos;t do anything .
For me , the Minister of Se@@ x Einstein is not sure that the Koran has to change , but it &apos;s not true that we &apos;re going to change the boundaries and the world .
In the last 20 years , the S@@ cienti@@ fic Emp@@ ire , and the 2@@ 6@@ th country spread across the 2@@ 6@@ th countries , and the people who have suffered severe lives , they expand the opportunities and the opportunity of the people who have suffered severe lives , and the people who have suffered a lot .
As Pi@@ ter L@@ ey@@ n@@ u said , you know , it &apos;s a unique presence that has to take care of people &apos;s health care .
From this perspective , the biggest challenge for our society is to be able to help the health care of someone who &apos;s needed to be able to get to the health care , and to make sure that it means to take care of it .
We should not live with hard work , and we should not live with them .
We &apos;re not there . We &apos;re not .
We don &apos;t take what &apos;s happening in the world , and we don &apos;t have to talk about it .
We don &apos;t go down .
He said to me , as he said to me , as he said to me , as he said to me , &quot; &quot; Tell others what &apos;s going on .
You &apos;re on the bar . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to talk about my funding .
But is this phot@@ oc@@ re ?
Because , you know , you can &apos;t take a picture with your camera .
So , I was 15 years old , when I was 15 years old , when I was 15 years old .
I &apos;ve been obsessed with the mar@@ gin@@ alized mar@@ ch , but a little bit of different ways , because I would be able to make the process of using the camera .
When you take a picture with the autom@@ ator , it &apos;s ready when you &apos;re in a picture .
But , according to me , the phot@@ ore@@ stic is not the right place .
I thought I could do it .
And so I wanted to make something different , something that happens after the actual picture of the century .
Here are images like this : that &apos;s what it means .
But it was an unexpected game .
And if we look at it , it &apos;s pretty much closer .
Or images like this , the images like this , the color of my life , but it &apos;s also the way that we could preserve the re@@ alism .
Re@@ alism , my theory of phot@@ ore@@ alism .
Because of course , it &apos;s not really many images that we can possibly make , but I want to make a picture of what &apos;s going on .
I want to ask you to deal with a little bit of attention .
So this is really the kind of thing that we need to hold right now .
What is it that we have to do with you ?
How do you have those crazy colors ?
Is it something ?
What is it ?
It &apos;s from a bat perspective .
But in the end , the world is beginning to understand how to deal with a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what this re@@ lies really , not really what this re@@ lies .
So it &apos;s very good for the ideal .
I see the re@@ per@@ to@@ ire of the re@@ per@@ to@@ ire of the re@@ per@@ to@@ ire that I &apos;ve created an alternative , which I &apos;ve created an alternative reality .
Let me show you a moment .
So there are three of the laws that have known to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to control three — three-dimensional — three-dimensional .
But in a certain way , there &apos;s a three-@@ dimensional object which is a three-@@ dimensional object .
We know that we can &apos;t exist .
So we can play the game with our brain , because our brain doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s not .
And I see the same as the phot@@ ons combine .
And this is actually the attribu@@ te of matter that are different .
So , the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we have around us .
Now , if you combine the whe@@ els together , it &apos;s really important , because it &apos;s also important , because in a way , you can see the sky .
And what I want to tell you is that there is a number of things that we have to do for a real world .
As you can see , these images don &apos;t matter .
But it turns out that it takes something .
So , in the first month , the phot@@ ons are represen@@ tative of the phot@@ ons .
Secondly , phot@@ ons have to be the same as the phot@@ ons .
And in these two ways , these two things were kind of en@@ lighten@@ ing — the same weigh@@ ts and the same light .
And thir@@ dly , the whole thing is a pattern that makes it possible to make the image of the image of the image , which is that one of the other things that we &apos;re going to do is make it possible .
It means that it should be self-@@ assemb@@ ling .
And in the middle of a remarkable picture , you can see the color of color in the middle of the book , the depth of the skin , the depth of the skin , the depth of the skin , the skin , the skin , the skin and the color of the skin , and you can see that there &apos;s a lot of different patterns in the middle of the spectrum , and we can see that there are hundreds of vari@@ ables .
This is another myth .
( Laughter ) People might think that this is a representation of this , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
But in fact , this picture of different parts of different parts of different places .
I think it &apos;s more than a place where you can make a place , and you need to change your ideas .
But it &apos;s very planning .
And I could have a couple of months to find that if I was in my mouth , I would have a couple of months to find ways to find different places .
For example , it &apos;s hard to take care of fish .
The beach is different .
The water is a six@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary of the water .
And in fact , in the middle of the island , I painted the opposite of Sweden to the next door to see the Swe@@ dish .
So , in fact , it &apos;s possible that if you think about something else , I think it &apos;s possible .
Every time there is a deal , it starts with an idea .
And then you combine different pictures .
For example , it &apos;s all sorts of very good plans .
And you can take pictures of the phot@@ ons , and you can have a little bit of feedback .
So we need all the benefits that we need , and that &apos;s what we need , and that &apos;s what we need .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Ju@@ lian .
It was given to a certain information that we published in the last year of the last year in the last year .
Is that possible ?
Ju@@ lian As@@ san@@ ge : Yes , yeah ?
Now , what &apos;s going on is that a lot of people don &apos;t want to go back to the rest of the world — a small activist — a small activist — a small activist — a small activist , a little activist .
CA : How do you do that ?
How about these art ?
How do you know ?
J@@ A : These are the images that we know , that we &apos;ve got the data that we &apos;re familiar with .
We don &apos;t want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to listen to the Internet , to make it comfortable , to make sure that we can go back to the United States to try to preserve the women .
And it turns out that it &apos;s a password that makes it encryp@@ ted , and it turns out that as it happens , it turns out that it &apos;s going through the theory that it takes place as it happens in their gen@@ ital literature , which is a little bit of gravity — that &apos;s a little bit of hard — and we need to preserve our own responsibility and the political divide .
CA : So , you know , the art of art — you don &apos;t even know who you are — you don &apos;t know who you are .
J@@ A : Well , we have to recognize them in rare people . If we don &apos;t have the data , we have no idea of the information .
( T@@ ele@@ phone rings ) Z@@ o@@ by@@ l .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the C@@ I@@ O@@ -@@ di code is asking for a book . ( Laughter )
You know , I think the M@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ est gu@@ ests .
This is a couple of years ago .
This is a theory .
It was a story from itself .
How do you talk about this story ?
J@@ A : This is an artist K@@ ri@@ ll Research .
After 2001 , after 2001 , he was looking for ap@@ ples by Kenya .
It was in Kenya in New York City , in Kenya in Kenya in New York City .
That was what we had to negoti@@ ate .
With the power of cancer , Ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i has been able to tackle two million pounds , and they published these two million pounds .
And in fact , in the United States , in K@@ ansas City , they used to use a political representation of the man who was the most advanced man .
This is the University of Kenya .
In 2009 , I &apos;ve been able to take a few months from 28 De@@ ca@@ d@@ ar elections from 28 De@@ ca@@ b elections .
This is the study of the new con@@ gres@@ sion of the new prime minister of the New Gu@@ i@@ el F@@ ur@@ el M@@ ani@@ el of the New Ye@@ ar sky , and after three days after that , we published the journal Ki@@ ds who came to die .
CA : Well , the short term of the long term — not to deal with the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , but it &apos;s been cr@@ ack@@ led by roads , and you think , you know , it changed the result of that choice .
J@@ A : Yeah . But before we did the Gu@@ ar@@ dian in the Gu@@ ar@@ dian , then there was Tanz@@ ania and Can@@ u@@ i Africa in countries around the world .
It came out of a story .
In a few days in a few days , he started writing about the fact that he was in the United States .
20 days later , in the United States , the publi@@ sh@@ ers published in the United States , and it changed the way that the U.S. security was changed , and it changed the way that they could change the number 10 percent .
CA : So , what you do is really change the world ?
J@@ A : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : And this time , this time , I have video about the weather in Ba@@ gh@@ dad .
It &apos;s a little length . This is a slide that &apos;s a slide .
And I &apos;m going to tell you , this is a video in this video .
Ra@@ dio : ... — oh , yeah , it &apos;s clear .
Now , they look at the X@@ ambi@@ st .
En@@ lighten@@ ment is .
There &apos;s no news .
F@@ ar .
Go , jump !
( A@@ v@@ ici@@ ous weapon ) D@@ av@@ m meat .
O@@ tel , Bu@@ s@@ ster T@@ win , Bu@@ s@@ ma@@ x T@@ win , Bu@@ s@@ ma@@ x T@@ win .
I had to take care of it .
We killed 8@@ ,000 &apos;s memories .
There are two stere@@ ot@@ y@@ sters , we go to jump .
It was . It died .
T@@ w@@ -@@ Si@@ x , T@@ w@@ -@@ Si@@ x@@ -@@ speaking , is moving .
O@@ op@@ s . Have it done ?
Z@@ i@@ i@@ by@@ l , K@@ ale . A@@ ha@@ a , it &apos;s solved .
CA : So how did this video did ?
J@@ A : It &apos;s been heavy for people who have worked .
This video was sent two grand@@ daughters in Ba@@ gh@@ dad to call it a video .
This is actually one of three nega@@ tives .
CA : Have about 11 grand@@ mothers who died in this gentleman , who would have 11 ?
J@@ A : Yes . He died . He died two Re@@ u@@ ters .
Here &apos;s a man who died of 18@@ -@@ 2@@ 6 grand@@ mothers .
CA : This is the publi@@ cation of the publi@@ cation of this .
Why do you think that this is a prime number ?
J@@ A : Well , I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t know , people think about power .
And when you go back to three people , the flying Ap@@ par@@ ity of people would laugh at the top of the day — no matter why , no matter how many of them have been — and they don &apos;t have them .
And there were two ju@@ st@@ al@@ ers who had no volume , and they had two prescrip@@ tions .
CA : The National Medi@@ cal security President Bra@@ d@@ ley came closer .
Is that true ?
J@@ A : We &apos;ve got these tex@@ ts .
About five days ago , after five or five , five or less than five of them were alive .
This year , we published the dance of R@@ ey@@ k@@ ome@@ d I@@ X , but it doesn &apos;t have that .
I had to ask for the original .
CA : If you did a diplom@@ atic art in the United States ?
J@@ A : We publish them . ( CA : Ex@@ actly . ) J@@ A : Yeah . ) J@@ A : So what ? ) J@@ A : So what ? ) J@@ A : So what ? ) J@@ A : How do you think that in the case of this country in the arts countries , in the countries of the country .
There are these kinds of materials that have these kinds of materials .
CA : I &apos;m a little bit about this .
In theory , what do you think ?
What do you think you &apos;re going to do right ?
J@@ A : Well , there is a question , which is why , for the world , is the case of the world &apos;s creation , which is why it can be created .
Ex@@ tro@@ pol@@ ites are very important .
Now , what we have to hide is that the news that I &apos;ve had to hide , the news is that the news will be a new new and good thing about what we have to do , and what we have to do with these data is really good .
It happens to be in the explosion . It &apos;s the history of freedom .
CA : But there &apos;s not a little bit of security , people who are not agree@@ ed when you &apos;re in the sp@@ ine of the lea@@ ks , who can &apos;t possibly be a bad deal .
J@@ A : We don &apos;t have the data that we &apos;re not going to do .
So we have a tendency to get rid of the debris .
Well , there are some other people in the audience , and then we published the publi@@ sh@@ er .
And there &apos;s a number of women — for example , for the disease of the disease , but we really work with the news that we really do , and we &apos;re really working with the people who know what we really did .
CA : You know , you know , it &apos;s good .
If you &apos;d come back to the United States in the United States , you get to tell you , &quot; &quot; You know , who &apos;s an artist in the United States ? &quot; &quot; This is , &quot; &quot; You know , who &apos;s an artist ?
People show the people that Americans are dying to die .
It shows that the man in the world with millions of people in this world show the human feeling of human emotion .
My son is not like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . You &apos;re going to be doing this ? &quot; &quot; Why would you say ?
J@@ A : It &apos;s a lot of people .
But sa@@ dly , you don &apos;t need to see the people in the Ba@@ da@@ d@@ room , the Iran@@ ian people in the United States , and they see them every day .
It doesn &apos;t change the idea . It doesn &apos;t change the way they feel .
Every day , they see their relationships .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to have to do for the interview of people who pay attention to this interview for this interview .
CA : So , you know , you don &apos;t find a way that you don &apos;t have a way .
It &apos;s pretty good .
But that &apos;s what the strange thing is to do with the light , to make the difference for light .
J@@ A : Not just . It &apos;s not just that . It &apos;s not the case of Wikipedia .
What happens is we don &apos;t have the data that we have .
If they have food , and a lot of them , it &apos;s hard for us to help us to help us to help us , to help us to help us , to help us , to help us to help us to help us .
CA : What do you think I have to do with you ? &quot; &quot; So what do you think about this is — TED@@ monitoring ?
There are two kinds of ideas about Wikipedia and Ju@@ lian .
One is — you know , the people who have light issues .
This is an inter@@ medi@@ ation for the future .
Who can agree that ?
What do you find ?
J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a couple of people who don &apos;t have to be there .
CA : This is people , Ju@@ lian .
We have a little bit more . Here &apos;s another example .
This is not published yet , but it will be published .
Is it something that &apos;s really interesting about these things ?
This is art ?
J@@ A : This is one of the things that we see every day .
The last thing that &apos;s been struck by the past — in the Al@@ ban@@ ian — in the Al@@ ban@@ ian , the Mex@@ ican blindness in the Gulf of Mexico .
And we had this interview , and actually , in fact , in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the ca@@ bles , the only way they set out to partner in the middle of the first week .
And the other people have a big deal here .
But there was nothing to do with them . It was a little tough art .
And we didn &apos;t know that my wife was writing .
We had a little bit of a game that &apos;s going to be the game company .
In fact , we &apos;ve talked about art , and we write like this , &quot; &quot; We are a little bit .
We don &apos;t know what we do .
Good art is art . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t know , but we don &apos;t even know if we had to find the information that we had before , trying to find the information that we had to find , and we started to find the answer from the company company that we had to find — ( Laughter ) — we want to find a little bit . &quot;
What do you talk about ?
What do you think ?
What do you think is that ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to go on on the screen on the screen on the screen .
It was like .
( Applause ) There are a lot of people .
And then we have the printing press , one of the ways that we had to write and write and write .
CA : Do you have a family ?
J@@ A : Oh , yeah , I &apos;m very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very important for counting .
We &apos;ve reduced the news news that we &apos;re trying to do with the first few months to see the number of people who are going to get rid of the last few months .
This is a little problem .
The other thing we &apos;ve got is a series of images that started in the new way , as we &apos;ve got to be able to take care of it , which is a lot of things that we need to do , but we don &apos;t have enough workers to make all these things happen .
CA : &quot; &quot; You need to tell you , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to you need to tell you about ?
J@@ A : Yeah . People we believe .
What &apos;s happening is that it &apos;s hard to go from one another , and it &apos;s hard to do with one another . &quot; &quot; We need people to deal with us as well .
CA : Do you know why , why could you say ?
You don &apos;t change the way you &apos;re in the middle of 3@@ 7 schools .
And right ?
J@@ A : My parents were the film that I didn &apos;t open up , and I didn &apos;t open the religious authorities .
( Laughter ) CA : P@@ ari@@ tho@@ logists have this anti-@@ par@@ an@@ o@@ ia .
J@@ A : Do you hold the film ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : I didn &apos;t know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
J@@ A : I was the J@@ ur@@ ke@@ er .
And I was one of the senior young people .
I &apos;ve been obsessed with the j@@ ur@@ n@@ ni@@ st in young people .
We need to act on a little bit .
It &apos;s possible to make a difference with the wheel .
Unfortunately , there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to take care of the people in the United States .
It &apos;s not like the wheel sa@@ u@@ ce .
CA : I don &apos;t think , who &apos;s who you are , who do you know , who are the important value of what &apos;s important ? What is important ?
You can give a short talk about them , or why do you talk about it ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not going to be the case .
But I mean , I mean , I have a lot of people who don &apos;t create a lot , and people don &apos;t create sports .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from people like that , in fact , that I learn from people .
CA : B@@ ac@@ ul@@ d , if you don &apos;t create the hon@@ ey@@ man , make them better ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m a little bit of people , I don &apos;t show them , and I don &apos;t show them , but I don &apos;t show them — but I don &apos;t have to show the people that I don &apos;t want to get people to cut the people out .
This is what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : Can you talk about what &apos;s going on in the last few minutes ?
The problem that you publish there is the problem with the bathroom , and the information that we published there was a drug .
At the end of the spectrum .
Have you ever created a good name or a good name .
J@@ A : This was a big deal .
It was a disaster in Islam .
It was one of the largest insects in the world .
It was 10 times more likely to grow up 10 times a year .
We published this data that we published .
It was five minutes before the publi@@ sh@@ ers were published on television .
We published X@@ banks in the middle of the summer , we published it in the Scot@@ land .
Everybody else has to deal with this whole community to deal harder . &quot; &quot; And then , after a few of the Swe@@ des politicians , a few of the countries of the United States had a new story , a new story that would have a new type of advice that would have a new story in the United States , which is a new story in the world that we have to do with the Nobel Prize .
There are some other countries in the middle of the middle of a country with Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an countries .
And just a month ago , it &apos;s been accepted in the United States .
CA : V@@ ou@@ u .
( Applause ) Si@@ x@@ ty-@@ thir@@ st , Ju@@ lian .
How do you believe that the future is going to happen ? &quot; &quot; When we think about everything in the secret way , I will tell you , if people don &apos;t want to do anything , no matter what happens ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not exactly sure what it is .
All the world — and in the United States and the United States and the United States , we are going to have a tendency to take care of equality .
It &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s going on .
The tat@@ to@@ os we live , we can change everything we can change .
CA : Don &apos;t tell you what our religions want to tell you about , Ju@@ lian , worry .
J@@ A : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Okay . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
And I &apos;m trying to tell you about the story , and I want to talk to you a little bit about what I &apos;m going to talk to you about today , and I &apos;m a little bit of a talk about what I &apos;m going to talk to you about today .
But let me tell you about the invention of my own personal story .
Now , I &apos;m going to use the words in words , and you &apos;re going to have a couple of apart@@ ments that are going to listen .
In S@@ tra@@ s@@ bur@@ sts , I was born in France .
And I came up with my parents , and I came up with my mother , and I came to Turkey .
I grew up as a kid in the middle of the day , as I was a kid .
In the 1970s , in the &apos; 70s , in the 1970s , it was a little strange .
Most of the families there were a lot of people in the world , the vast majority of the families in the P@@ rit@@ ar@@ x@@ al earthquake , I was kid@@ ding with my mother .
In fact , I &apos;ve got two women in the middle of two countries .
On a side , the war , the world , the war , the war , the hunting of hunting , the hunting of hunting .
But then , if there was only one side of my wife , I would have fewer national grand@@ fathers , less op@@ pressed , less op@@ pressed .
So what I &apos;m saying is that when he looked at the pros@@ the@@ tics and his grandmother , he would make a lot of copyright , to make sure that he would make it .
They came to come back to the next generation of people who were facing their parents .
Every time I returned to the next time , I went mad , to get rid of the United States .
And then we went to see each other .
After a week , they came back to the news for a while .
And I know that I didn &apos;t tell you that I had to talk about how I could talk about it , and I don &apos;t see people who are going to talk to anyone else , but I don &apos;t see people who have a lot of copyright encoun@@ ters next to my grandmother .
How did I ask my grandmother &apos;s power ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s some kind of thing that we have , but it &apos;s the power of what &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; And when I learn from it , there &apos;s a lot of promise . If I don &apos;t want to do it , there &apos;s a lot of promise . If you want to not , if you want to not , if you don &apos;t want to do anything in life , we need to take care of it .
And there is a sho@@ b in it .
It &apos;s all of us right now , and we &apos;ve all been in common and values .
Most of our senses are .
We &apos;re born in the universe as a result of what we &apos;re doing .
But in a world that we don &apos;t have to do with a world , we don &apos;t know if we can connect to the world from the world .
Our average power can be reduced . Our product is s@@ cat@@ tered . We &apos;ve got a lot of sense of human@@ ism .
Our to@@ aster , our partners , our business comm@@ u@@ ters , our business comm@@ u@@ ters , and if we have a lot of attention , our essence , our essence .
And what I &apos;m going to do is tell you that these women like a little bit like this , you know , don &apos;t hear about the top of the laugh today , or the sound of the laugh today .
This is a beli@@ ever in the world that &apos;s going to exist . It &apos;s not enough to take care of a person .
Even though it &apos;s strange , it &apos;s one of the largest percentage of the world that we &apos;re trying to live ideas that share ideas that share ideas .
And this is everywhere , between liber@@ als and Muslims , between liber@@ als and Muslims and Muslims , there are plenty and prisons and prisons .
We &apos;re going to be able to make the rest of the world , and we &apos;re going to be able to make some stere@@ ot@@ o@@ otyp@@ es about the others .
I think I think that the way I think about my ideas is that the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ ni@@ est art should be .
And if we don &apos;t have the calcul@@ ations in the world , we can open up in the bas@@ ement .
Now , looking at these things , we can see other worlds .
I started writing stories from eight .
One day , my mother gave me the elephant , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a good idea of writing stories .
Now , I think that when I think about it , I think it &apos;s a little bit of wine .
It was good for me to deal with my calcul@@ ations , but it wasn &apos;t good for me to talk about these stories .
I &apos;m a kid who &apos;s going to take care of them , and I &apos;m a kid who &apos;s going to take care of what I &apos;m touching the to@@ aster , and I &apos;m a kid , I &apos;m a kid .
But he didn &apos;t know that my life was a really powerful idea that I had to think about , and what I wanted to do was to ask me about what I was trying to do .
And I started writing about it , not about myself , and I started writing about things that didn &apos;t matter .
I was like to put my atten@@ ding cycle on my love .
For me , it was the stories of others who were more likely to take care of others from hunting hunting .
Go ahead , put it up a little bit : ( Applause ) I &apos;ve got these memories in my life .
This leads to another event in the desert .
My mother became a diplom@@ at .
And when I was at the same time , I went through the middle of the middle class , and in the M@@ edit@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an , the middle of the middle of the middle class , I was in the middle of college .
The first time I was in the phrase &quot; &quot; typical x@@ ar@@ ar@@ ter , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a little bit of a picture . &quot; &quot; There were kids all over clu@@ ster@@ ing birds , but this was a democra@@ tiz@@ ation for democracy .
And in fact , kids have experienced their own role as they &apos;ve experienced their own role , not themselves .
We &apos;ve been talking about refugees , and I &apos;m going to have a lot of fun to deal with a bad mistake , and the rest of the audience will fall out of the rest of it .
And in Bel@@ gi@@ um , I was surrounded by my kids , and it was always worried .
And the good thing is , when I was in this school , Turkey was going to kill the pes@@ tici@@ de of the species , and in the E@@ u@@ k@@ ville , the star@@ tled gun in the E@@ u@@ k@@ ville , and the En@@ viron@@ ment of E@@ u@@ k@@ ville .
( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to see if I was in the middle of my te@@ ar school in my te@@ ar school .
The first time I saw this in the middle time , I saw the invent@@ or of ster@@ o@@ ids .
All of the kids I don &apos;t look at . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ ni@@ est Ex@@ pi@@ st@@ ences . &quot; &quot; And they asked me to take a few months , and they had all sorts of species , and they had all sorts of species .
So I &apos;ve learned about the three stron@@ g@@ ics attached to Turkey , and this is what we &apos;ve learned about politics .
From Spanish to Russia , Ger@@ mans and Ger@@ mans came to Antarctica .
I think I had the idea that I had the idea that my visual strength and my relationship to my visual strength is that I think it &apos;s all the way that we all agree .
It &apos;s a sense of what I &apos;m worried about , and it &apos;s a sense of self-@@ transc@@ end@@ ence , and I have no idea of it .
I was the Iran@@ ian village in my 20s that I loved in my 20s .
I had a lot of epi@@ ph@@ op@@ o@@ li@@ ans and living in a living world , and I wrote one of my rom@@ ance here .
I was in the 199@@ 9@@ -@@ th year .
And I &apos;d like to see what I saw in 3D , at all three points of information .
It was a man , he didn &apos;t sell an old hair , he didn &apos;t sell it , and he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t sell the people with anyone .
And in the beginning of the long term , it was sitting in the eye of the eye , and it was sitting in the eye .
And I saw the si@@ e@@ ge from the si@@ bl@@ ings that he took from the si@@ bl@@ ings , and I had to make sure that I could take care of it , which is the way that I &apos;m going to take care of it .
When we &apos;re going to get rid of the population of death and mountains , we &apos;re going to get a lot of different points of view , but we have a lot of attention .
But I believe that the stories I had to do is I believe in stories .
I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have a good novel , but we can begin to recognize the people that we don &apos;t know about , and we don &apos;t have good idea about what we don &apos;t think about .
I went to the cou@@ ch , and then I went to Mal@@ é , and I went to the Mal@@ dives .
Not only in the geograp@@ hic corner , but it was the time that we had language .
I started writing English .
I &apos;m an architect , I &apos;m not a pes@@ si@@ mi@@ st , and I &apos;m not talking about the reason why I write the word &quot; &quot; cause . &quot; &quot; It helps me change my wish .
I like to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like it , I write it , I write it . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I write English . &quot; &quot; I love English .
I think I think I &apos;m connected to each other .
I later learned about English , as a million people in the world , in English , in English .
H@@ ans@@ a language later , when she &apos;s asked , &quot; &quot; You know , in the village , you &apos;re learning what to learn .
And we don &apos;t talk about it , we want to talk about better words , better ways to work better , because we &apos;re less likely to talk about our brain and our language .
This is the difference .
But if we learn from it , it can be a process .
This is what I &apos;ve learned in Bos@@ nia — the cli@@ ff of the mountain , and the magic style .
I could sit on my behalf of my own life , and I could sit on my behalf , and I could sit on a stage where I had to think about it , and then I could sit on the idea of a matter where I thought about it .
I had a life for my grandmother .
( Laughter ) But I went to Ari@@ z@@ ona , I went to Ari@@ z@@ ona .
And I started to go to see the way that I was in I@@ st@@ ad@@ as in I@@ st@@ ad@@ as , and I was going to go back and see the difference between the other two neutral people in the world .
I &apos;m a part of physics , and you &apos;re looking at the physics of physics .
It &apos;s as if I have stories , and I have stories to try to sell all my pieces .
And I think that the story that I think is more capable than the story of the story more than the stories of the story .
I would like to tell you about this problem .
One of the other things that I wrote in English is that one of the people I wrote in the U.S.
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve got the book . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got a little bit differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked the question .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , we can see if you can see that , you know , we have the same idea , the American and the American , but there &apos;s Turkey . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s Turkey . &quot; &quot; And in fact , in the middle of the university , there was a number of people who had more people who had more different nations than species .
But I also know that I &apos;m going to make it work .
He wanted me to be my wife .
He wanted it to be a kind of name for which I name a species .
We can tell stories from the world to change the world .
Most of the strangers don &apos;t have to deal with that , no matter what we &apos;re going to do .
If you think about the Islamic world from the Islamic world , they &apos;re looking for your writing about Islam , which is better , not even better .
More in@@ forma@@ tive , depres@@ singly typical stories that you don &apos;t have to extend your writing , you &apos;re not going to be able to extend your writing .
In the literature that I &apos;m sorry about in the journal M@@ edit@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an , I &apos;ve got the headlines that I &apos;m sorry about .
There are no strangers who have affairs , not as creative people who have ideas , but they look at a few author from a few author , and a few author from a few author , from Ni@@ k@@ ola .
It &apos;s not the difference of our money , but it &apos;s not true .
In 198@@ 4 , when the printer and the foun@@ der of the elephant and the foun@@ der of the elephant , they asked him a few times about hom@@ os@@ ex@@ uality .
And the people who took the web to make a blue printer , and he said , &quot; &quot; You can see that there &apos;s nothing in the heads , I don &apos;t have anything to do with anything else ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t see if I don &apos;t have anything else . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to have to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have anything to do with anyone else . &quot;
Many of all the pr@@ inter@@ s that we have experienced from women who have no trouble in literature are the family of literature .
It &apos;s about 10 years ago in the Harvard M@@ ey@@ en M@@ ey@@ en , the first time in Harvard Square .
We &apos;ve got three printer , the F@@ all@@ u@@ ph@@ us , a new one , a new story from Turkey .
( Laughter ) And we had to put us together , and we &apos;re not going to see ourselves .
We were lonely .
They &apos;re looking at the actual stories of writing stories from other nations .
It is a family of a child .
This is not the same type of printer , but it &apos;s also the basis of the neo@@ cortex .
And I &apos;m going to have to be able to tell the story , not in the Bible .
Every world is food .
And in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 , I saw the rest of the world .
And I &apos;ve worked with my work , and I &apos;ve been docu@@ menting a lot about my family , and I &apos;ve got a lot of science .
And the little story I had to compla@@ in was that I was going to have a big machine .
And I wrote a bunch of people who said , &quot; &quot; Tur@@ n — I &apos;ve written a little bit about what I write about ? &quot;
But I &apos;d like to tell you all over both sides of my life , which is just a matter of literature .
It &apos;s just the story .
I don &apos;t want to tell you that I want to reduce the value of the value that I see .
It &apos;s not because it doesn &apos;t really understand how to deal with reality .
They &apos;re known to see politicians looking at the black hole , but the political books of political books today is not the language of politics .
This is what you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to take care of the right path .
And it &apos;s the job of art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The politics of the political world is separ@@ ating us from each other . &quot; &quot; He assemb@@ led .
One of them does not belong .
The second is different .
One is gravity .
Di@@ rec@@ tor doesn &apos;t know .
The political city was flat .
Wor@@ ds of literature .
They said , &quot; &quot; The word &quot; &quot; dic@@ tion@@ aries , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot; &quot; They said stories with a lot of people who have never talked about stories .
They change the way they could express the patterns in the eye to express the solutions .
He was listening to him , and people who are older , even more Muslims , are the Muslims .
The concerns of the He@@ tal@@ e , the Middle A@@ ges , the H@@ im@@ i Africa , the Bal@@ k@@ ans , the Bal@@ k@@ ans , the Bal@@ k@@ ans and the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an .
Today , stories are going to continue to go .
F@@ ant@@ astic and Iran@@ ian politicians , they don &apos;t hang together to each other , but they don &apos;t have the capability to read the historical printer and read the historical printer , and the story of the literature that we have heard about , the story of the story .
Life should take us further away .
If it doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s not good .
The books of the books — a few months old , and the kids who were going to be embarras@@ sed .
But it has to budget of books .
After all , the printer and the foun@@ der of the S@@ cienti@@ st Ad@@ i So@@ ci@@ ety came across the water , and the first thing happened to be the product of R@@ um@@ i .
For the Su@@ f@@ an@@ ese , they said , &quot; &quot; You know , we can &apos;t go away from the sky . &quot; &quot; The problem today is the problem of mar@@ gin@@ alism is not the problem of war .
So I have a little bit of a computer : to live like a computer .
One of the women is still a fixed .
But then , if other women can tat@@ to@@ ze my dive .
I mean , I &apos;m certain .
One of the facts that I &apos;ve been hearing is the same as the I@@ st@@ all Turkey , and the other part of the other part is that there &apos;s a lot of different things .
Now , I think that I think I &apos;ve had my stories , but I think that there is a family in which I &apos;m going to be everywhere .
You can see , you know , you &apos;ll see the meeting of the meeting , you &apos;ll see the meeting of 1@@ 400 years of O@@ s@@ man@@ -@@ 1@@ 000 .
In Sar@@ gas@@ sia , there &apos;s a place which is called the C@@ ax@@ es of the Pacific Ocean .
It &apos;s in the interface of buildings .
This is a lot of mine .
We have to believe that in order to think about what &apos;s happening .
I think that if you think about the fact that it &apos;s been able to take place and change the way that we &apos;re able to change the way that we &apos;re able to change the way that we &apos;re able to change the world .
But I think that art should be art to be art .
I &apos;m going to change the way I &apos;m going to change the way I &apos;m writing .
I love to think about the next 10 seconds .
I love the courage to make my daughters .
I can write a story about the Muslims , and I can write a lot about the Muslims , and you &apos;ll get a great deal . But if I think about the character , there might be a kind of blue professor who has a bat .
We can write about everything we can write .
A@@ u@@ do L@@ ore@@ da says , &quot; &quot; We have an idi@@ ot , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; I think it was an architect .
And I don &apos;t understand , why do we talk about things in the village in the village , in the village .
Maybe it &apos;s not really good for that .
It doesn &apos;t rely on what we are , and what we are creative , and what we are creative .
We need to teach ourselves about our fears and each other .
We need to recognize other worlds .
It &apos;s kind of like the beg@@ inn@@ ings of a dru@@ m , like the Mal@@ dives .
Now , if you don &apos;t have a political situation , they combine all of these things together .
I &apos;d like to finish with the question of the question , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , you know , we &apos;re introduced to , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , we have to be friends , the world &apos;s magic world . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
And I think it &apos;s a little shri@@ mp , which is a small idea that will allow us to take a lot of money in our lives .
This is my little ide@@ alism .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Here are the women who are in A family .
They are women .
And I understood what &apos;s going on .
Just two years ago , I was the disap@@ point@@ ment .
My father was st@@ ated , my face , my face , was shot by five .
I started to understand the value of the nest .
I &apos;ve been looking for my wife , who , who , in my hands , have a tendency to say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re not more productive , you know , if you &apos;re more productive , you &apos;re not familiar .
( Applause ) So we &apos;ll go to the title of women .
We &apos;re going to be the most specific thing about the word .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s very impressive , because it &apos;s very much more likely to be able to communicate .
This is a person who &apos;s been talking about a young person who has been on a couple of people who are in the middle of a year .
And I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You know , I didn &apos;t say — &quot; &quot; You know , you know , I didn &apos;t say — &quot; &quot; you know , I didn &apos;t say — I didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , I didn &apos;t say — &quot; &quot; you know , I didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , I didn &apos;t say — &quot; &quot; you know , I didn &apos;t say , &quot;
If he had five hours of dragonflies , he said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re more likely to get a number of dragonflies ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So many of you have a lot less .
You want to take care of it , if you don &apos;t want to eat it , and if you &apos;re asked , &quot; &quot; What is eight ? &quot; &quot; And if you ask , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you &apos;re going to play a little bit , and no matter what you &apos;re going to do , I &apos;ll play a little bit . &quot; &quot; And then they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to be the leaders who are
We don &apos;t have the dragonflies .
Not because we don &apos;t have good leaders , we don &apos;t have good leaders , no good leader .
The stories of our Tit@@ anic is a lot of people .
I think it &apos;s been Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers and Bal@@ i Bro@@ wn , who was the Su@@ preme Court .
( Applause ) In the summer of seven days , seven or eight hours a year or eight or eight hours of dragonflies , we could tell the story about what &apos;s going on .
There are lots of people who are willing to be willing to be engaged in our lives , who are willing to be engaged in our lives , who are willing to be willing to live in our lives .
Now , imagine that if you can see the great ide@@ als to be able to be able to see the great ide@@ als in your own , you &apos;ll see the power of the device .
Thank you very much .

The brain disease is the brain disease .
What is problem ?
Dr. Fr@@ ance Ben@@ es@@ t .
I said , &quot; &quot; Why are people who are considered to be considered normal to be accepted as normal as usual .
I learned that in my brain , I learned that in my brain .
I was like a kid who was blind in the village .
If you can see the brain , the brain is about two CE@@ Os .
This is the equivalent of a matter of the brain .
So , in parallel , there &apos;s a parallel process .
It &apos;s been the same for two centi@@ meters .
And when I think about different things about different things , we have different things .
Please for@@ give me . Thank you so much . It &apos;s been .
Our right brain is learning to learn from the way our body moves .
Now , let &apos;s put it in all of the sensory appar@@ at@@ us , how do you think of what &apos;s going on in all kinds of psychological systems , how do you think about how it works , how it feels like , how do you feel and how it works .
We &apos;re an ener@@ ge@@ tic energy in relation to our right brain .
And in this area , we are very , very , and eye .
And our left brain is a completely different place .
On the left is the idea that we &apos;ve got the left .
So , it turns out that it &apos;s going to take care of its left race .
And if our left brain is born in language .
Our world is associated with our external world .
This is us : &quot; &quot; If you have the bathroom in your home , you need to have a bathroom .
And when we tell us that there &apos;s going to go to the next palm , we need to go .
And in my own business , I started to drive .
I think it &apos;s more than a re@@ per@@ to@@ ire — which is from a re@@ trac@@ tor — which is the way that I think about id@@ le .
I feel that my body is slow and slow .
And what I &apos;d been trying to do is take a sho@@ wer on a pra@@ yer .
I had to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say to you .
I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t see the atomic molecules and the molecular molecules .
And the only thing I could know is an external energy — it was good .
Have you ever seen me ?
All of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my work , and all of my
( Laughter ) I &apos;m feeling disap@@ point@@ ment .
Let &apos;s tell you that you &apos;re less than your eye .
It was a feeling .
And my left brain is the rest of my brain .
And I am my right partner .
And my brain is thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh !
( Laughter ) And then it comes to my mouth . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t have time to be successful . &quot;
You need to want to take care of it , I need to do it .
I &apos;m trying to do it .
And when I go back and back , I &apos;m going back to my numbers .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with you , and I &apos;ve got the numbers of numbers that I &apos;m holding into the phone .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like the Gol@@ den Ra@@ stro@@ oms . &quot;
What happens to me is my identity in my life .
And my brain is a combination between two re@@ all@@ els and two re@@ als .
How many of you are , how do you live my life ?
And I &apos;m going to be able to go online , alone , with power .
If we choose to manage to manage the right brain , we choose to manage to manage our brains .
