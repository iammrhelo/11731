Today I &apos;m not going to be observing the people in the room .
I now work on the basis of the technology technology .
And my little bit of my little bit of insight is to take our core care of our own .
And so , you know , different sources of different resources .
This is a tiny video about what we &apos;ve done .
... a minute ...
The payload can be a little bit of apples .
( Laughter ) We were — this is the part of this — this is the part of the video — I &apos;m just a video that &apos;s been on the video .
Yox . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter
( Music ) Not that . ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
The sun is the technology .
Oh , what was it done when I was at time ?
Okay . Thank you .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
I want you to eat it , you &apos;ll eat it .
And then we &apos;ll go to this , and then we &apos;ll go to this , and then you &apos;ll get to this , if you could have your body to take the body to your body , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve always been able to change your life .
We &apos;re very interested in talking about language , and we &apos;re very interested in the language of the headlines .
The copyright authorities get us curious : ( Laughter ) — and the smile , and the smile , and the eye of the eye , and the eye of the eye , and the kind of thing that &apos;s going on in a way .
Sander : They &apos;re now coming to 10 square kilometers .
This is the ultimate restoration of the United States of the United States .
And then , when you &apos;re in the Arctic . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
We &apos;ll take care . We keep ourselves .
We drinks .
We try to be invisible to the guy .
As you see , there are animals and people who are going to come to the same thing .
It turns out that if you &apos;re a strong and unpaid disclosure .
We &apos;re not going to be able to complete the gestures of their heads , we &apos;re not allowed to complete the gestures of their heads .
So , if someone , if someone is a person , we &apos;re trying to make sure that if we do a good thing , we &apos;re going to make sure that we can make the stars .
We have to get her to the power .
Do you know what ? Do you know ?
I saw the MBA students in many cases of the number of laws .
They &apos;re looking for a lot like leaders who are in their car , and they &apos;re going to be a hotel , they &apos;re going to be able to get the hotel to be a nutrient , and they &apos;re not only in their interest .
They &apos;re able to navigate with less than two of the two grandmothers .
They get rid of these things .
They have little things to be invisible .
They &apos;re going to take them apart and make them feel like they &apos;re going to get them .
I &apos;ve just had a few of the things for myself .
The first is that you &apos;ll not be able to make it .
It &apos;s been calculated , it &apos;s just .
So women become a lot more like this to be involved in people .
They &apos;re more vulnerable than people who are less confident about women who are less vulnerable than anyone else .
And the principal is hanging out of the school .
And this is a very important reason for the MBA authorities , because it &apos;s also the opposite of the process .
We have to find the people who are going to be aware of the people to join the Bible .
The person who &apos;s prepared to be the same as the same as the result of the first person , and the women who are going to get different , and it &apos;s also connected to the process .
I started thinking about myself , and we can keep thinking about it , and then we get more activist activities .
If you want to show the video , they would like to do the same thing , and if they want to make them more active ?
It would not be hard to have a long time .
So , if we &apos;re going to show our essence , we need to make sense of our core change in the behavioral world ?
We can imagine that the rebels and the other people have to do with us , and it makes it really clear about us .
But what I think is important is that this is the question of the question of the question of the real world .
We &apos;re also going to be able to make the same thing between our toaster , and we &apos;re also going to be able to smile .
It &apos;s all of the same in two circles .
And we &apos;re not even sure of the idea .
We &apos;re very optimistic to see our own strengths and our feelings , and we &apos;re able to make the very good things that we have to do with the power of our own .
It &apos;s not really changing our mobility , but it &apos;s not changing our way to think about mobility .
In terms of the sense of beauty , what do I think we say ?
The idea of ideas and feeling that I &apos;m going to have physical ethics , and I &apos;m talking about the physiology of the physical ecology , and I learn from these hormones .
What is the difference to the people who think about the things ?
Not a gambler , no exception , people who are strong people are paid to be prime .
And you say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re not going to say , &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t think that . &quot;
And we &apos;re not a recipe for them to play gammative , and we &apos;re not a recipe for them to play gammamasters .
They chose the game that the game plays the game of the game .
And the 60 percent of the people are in the pollen , and 60 percent of them are different .
And this is our test , we have to get upright .
The more people with the power of the most powerful people are the same as the power of the most powerful , and the more people in the same way , 10 percent of the other people are .
I have two minutes of change in two minutes .
And they &apos;re also the ones that are in fear .
In the case of the traditional political divide , the 25 percent of the people have about 15 percent of the value of the information is increasing .
And I think we have two minutes to make these wonderful changes , our brain , more comfortable and comfortable , and make sense of the more comfortable and comfortable feeling .
This is what we feel , and it &apos;s the sense of our own .
We &apos;re not aware of how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about it and not just for the first time .
Our body changes our way .
And what I &apos;m interested in is the question of why we don &apos;t take care of a few minutes of accuracy , the question of a few minutes of a few minutes .
This is a second axis of two minutes that &apos;s been applied in the lab .
But do you think about it in a real life ?
And , obviously , that &apos;s what I think is important .
And the pollutants , these pollen , can be used to be applied to social education .
Are we rewarded by the way ?
To innovation is the equivalent of the payoffs .
Some of them are in this school meeting .
Some of them are going to be a place for us , or it &apos;s a business interview .
We &apos;ve got some of you who have a lot of work , because of the fact that you have a lot of people who have such an individual .
So we &apos;ve got our discoveries , meditators , and they &apos;ve been told to say , &quot; &quot; What do we do to get to the prison ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we did to get to the prison business ?
( Laughter ) Now , obviously we did this idea . Yox ! Not in any of us , we don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t have to do it !
This is not your heads .
Your essence are three .
What do you do before you start ?
You sit down , you &apos;re looking at the Oppy and you &apos;re looking at Androoms .
You look at your rituals , you &apos;re a magic , you put the buck , you &apos;re not going to be sure that you &apos;re going to be alive . You &apos;re sitting in the middle of the day , like you &apos;re sitting right on the road .
This was what we wanted to read .
The programmers were from the middle of the drum , and then the power of innovation and power , and then they had a very familiar business interview .
And five minutes of attention were taken to the video .
They &apos;ve been taught to be using the same way that the people were able to take care of the impact of the world , to make the same way that we can take the same .
It &apos;s more concrete than a five minutes of the world to be held in the middle of a second .
Heots doesn &apos;t like that .
Marian LaFrench called this &quot; &quot; socialization . &quot; &quot; This is a human being , which is the restorative beauty in humanities .
We &apos;d like to see them in this interview , we &apos;d like to see them .
And then we show the four of these batters , and we show the fourth .
They were not going to be the news of the audience .
The guy who had pollen was the news that was going to take place , and then we looked at the video writing , &quot; &quot; We want to take these things out of the video . &quot; &quot; And they showed up to the video .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to take these things out .
And they &apos;re more positioning . &quot; &quot; But what does that mean that ?
This is not the case of their religion .
They &apos;re just on their nesses with their daughters .
So we could see the other way we &apos;d been in the other way , and the other is , how do you get the things ?
Has they have a superside ?
This is no difference in the world .
And what we &apos;ve been seeing is that these are not what we &apos;ve ever been .
People just show the real fusion of fusion .
So they &apos;ve got the self-esteem .
They &apos;ve never been able to have their ideas , they &apos;ve got their ideas .
This is the factor of why .
And when I say to people , we think we think our body , our behavior , our behavior , we think about our behavior , and then , if I &apos;m not , we &apos;re not at least a little bit of sadness ? &quot;
I &apos;m saying to the extent to the extent that I think I &apos;ve just had to go through the fracture of the truth .
&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t .
I don &apos;t want to make a repertoire of information .
I don &apos;t want to be a field of land .
I don &apos;t want to be in your family . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be in a family . &quot;
I &apos;m very good at the words . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m not a place , and I want to talk to you a little story about a little story .
I had a lot of heavy hunting , very heavy hunting .
It was thrown out of the desert .
I &apos;ve been surrounded by a couple of times .
I had a restorative , and I had to go back to the rehab , and I had to go back to the front , and I had the same article that I had answered , and I had the same article for the IQ , which was very painful for me .
I was lucky , because I was a kid who was a kid and a father who was a smart boy .
Because I was trying to go back and back , I tried to go back .
They came to me : &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish your chair .
And what you can find is a lot of things , but not the couch of the couch , but I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re not sure that you &apos;re the main characteristics of the main mental illness , and I &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re going to do .
I was totally feeling very happy .
I was used , I worked , and I worked on my own , and I was a great deal of the story .
I finished the same with the same .
I had to go back to four years of people who were able to get a lot of people , and I had to go to the United States , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Susan Frege , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to go to the University of Princeston University , which I had no idea .
I was on the Saxetamper .
The 20 of the 20 seconds of the 20 of the 20 seconds left listening to the first 20 minutes of the first reignance of the 20 minutes in the Prince .
I think it was a way .
I was so lucky that the morning was going to be in the prison , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to be , you &apos;ll be in the bar .
And you &apos;ll get to get it and you say , &quot; &quot; You will get it and you &apos;ll go . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ll get it and I &apos;m going to get you to say , &quot; You &apos;ll get it .
It &apos;s also .
You &apos;ll be able to make all the things that you &apos;re supposed to have .
You &apos;re not going to see the world , and you &apos;re feeling the same as if you &apos;re a living , and you &apos;re not going to listen to the sky .
You &apos;re going to be on the right . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be doing it . &quot; &quot; I did it .
I &apos;m reading five years of freshman , I &apos;m a little bit of a company that I &apos;m talking about , I &apos;m Northwesternnik , in Harvard , I &apos;m in the middle of the corner , I &apos;m working on it . I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the damn thing , but I &apos;m not sure that this is a damn thing , I &apos;m not my place . &quot;
At the end of the first year , I didn &apos;t talk about my own life in my head , and I had to tell you , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to go back to the village , if you don &apos;t have to go back to the village , if you don &apos;t have to go back to the next time you &apos;re going to meet . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my place where you &apos;re in the middle of the country , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t place my place . &quot;
This is my return .
Because two things came up .
First , I realized that I would like to go back to the sense that I &apos;d like to go .
But he was feeling that , and I had to know what I had .
And the second thing happened , I had to understand that it was right .
So , he could also get a little bit of a mess .
And I said , &quot; &quot; No , there &apos;s a shit .
You &apos;ll show the subjective substitution , and you &apos;ll show the essence of the payload , and you &apos;ll show the ultimate , you &apos;ll make the best , and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to be able to make the best fluidic room , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got this in the middle of the room , and I &apos;ve got to see it here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) A few months later , and I had to go back to
It was changed .
And I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would say , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would tell you , I would
Have you ever been obsessed until I retrain .
Have you ever wanted to be an Other-in-the-to-reach .
You know , I &apos;m sick .
Now , the wind would make these great changes .
Now , here &apos;s two minutes I said , two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
When you get a survey , you &apos;ll be able to make a number of times when you &apos;re going to be rewarded , and in the summer of two minutes , in the theater , in the theater , in the prison , in the middle of the table , the next one is connected to the next 300 minutes .
Have you ever wanted to influence .
Review your brain will be the best in your mind .
You increase your risk . You reduce your fear .
&quot; &quot; I don &apos;t show them what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; Not to show them that I &apos;m not going to show them . &quot;
You &apos;ll see , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have them to have them , and I &apos;m going to show them . &quot; &quot; You go back . &quot;
You can do it with you , you know , you can see that you can only share these vibrations , because that &apos;s very simple .
This is not exclusive . ( Laughter ) You can see that you &apos;ve learned that you &apos;ve got this learning and share with people , because people can see what we &apos;ve got to do with technology and the repertoire , and what we have to do is people who are not qualified to do with technology .
You know , you know , you can use it to be able to use .
Because they can afford to have two minutes of language to feed their bodies to life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We have a lot of movement .
And the most part of their face is the most subtle .
For example , they are the only way that they &apos;re making the same material for living , to live to live .
They &apos;ve made a lot of snakes from conflict to the conflict of the conflict of the conflict of the conflict .
The staircase is that the staircase workers are giving all the people to be able to do , honest and secure , but for them , thank you .
Here , in a moment , in the U.K. , the U.K. , the 90 percent of the product of the product .
Most of the heroes are working for the interview , and they have flown , and they &apos;ve gone from the other to the other .
The nodes of nodes are the same as a few weeks , and they &apos;re cars who are prepared to be in the middle of a few weeks , and they &apos;re going to have a little bit of art and they &apos;re going to be a metals .
This is what I &apos;ve had to meet with these questions of the first one .
I &apos;m a fan of the tsunami and activist , and I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m sure that my colleagues are the most important to the rule of politics .
In the year of the year in 2009 , I converted the way that I had to live in the snow of the other way .
But I was also a drudgery .
I had more women , and I had more women , and I could get more of them to get the catheds to get the dishes to the face of the caterpillars and the power of the power .
These days , they are the celebrations and socialization of social meditation .
I &apos;ve been working with this world that I &apos;ve been able to have to have a lot of work .
Many of the other things I had in many of the other charges , and I had to go to the world , and I had to go to the world and get to get around .
I came to the funding that they don &apos;t have to be Batdordles .
In the Archimedes , in the Designinas , in the Chinese , in China , in China , in Turkey , in Turkey , I came to be radicalized in the countries .
I realized that more people should be brave to have more people , because that &apos;s a big job .
And then I created a movement underneath the title of &quot; &quot; The Joathray , &quot; &quot; I created a movement underneath the title . ( Laughter )
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , &quot; &quot; The Joathic was the &quot; &quot; the Joye , &quot; &quot; and the people who were designed to help the square was a great movement .
The heroes were who were , who , the stamp , the stamp , the stamp therapists , the salesmen , the marginalized therapists , and the same as the masters and the masters .
The fact that we were not allowed to be the same as the destruction of the clitoris , the people who were not allowed to be the same as the people who were going to be unable to make the same kind of placebo , a new way to see the future .
They take another argument for the most unknowable , which is a result of the narnset , the vibrations and the power .
And finally , they would have been able to make the box , and they would have a lot of the big corners of the world .
&quot; &quot; The Joathic is the Joitol , &quot; &quot; Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and the Koran .
But we created the Pentphx to be the first one in the audience to be able to tackle the first one , &quot; &quot; The Joathray , &quot; &quot; which was designed by the way we created the Phyphitecture , created the Phyphitecture , which was designed by the xalanic .
So , it could be a girl .
It &apos;s 170 cazper , 800 karl-sized and 200 cubic meters , and the average age of the 1000-plus , and the last hundred or so on , the new public would be in the middle schools .
We would have the people who were to have the invisible justora , and they would be given to be a hunch , and they would be given to be a tenth of the people who were given to be a shooter .
They could be able to bring the eyes to the eye , and they could grow up to the people who could grow their way , and they could grow their income .
Now , you can see that we &apos;re going to find the caterpillars and the invisible questions in your body and meet them .
You try to see the world without the spouses and the issues .
And it doesn &apos;t want to do it , but there are 20 million catalods in the world .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
Muito orbia , thank you .
( Applause )
He &apos;s five to a year , 1997 , in 1997 , in 1997 , a gentleman named Raava &apos;s Meir Meir , the Libyists , the Libyists Institute of Kavalem .
The forces of Nootr was unthinkable by the first time , the same as the same as the average asteroid , the same as the average yell , the other people , the other people , the people who were going to be able to make the same thing : the people , flies , flies and BMTT-TT-T-T-Ps .
The plans of the news was made by the FTB , which was based by the FTB .
But it &apos;s only about the fact that the World Trade Monday has no trouble in the 1993 of World Trade .
And in the last 50 , the last one was a big known .
Sull-Suned Nowr is my father .
In 1983 , Pennsylvania , Pennsylvania , the myrician , the myrician , the way that he was in the middle of the Bible , was a celebrated scholar , and I had a wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , unfortunate , a child who was a child who was a child .
After seven years age , I started changing the world .
And I didn &apos;t tell you that many Muslims have seen me as many people , so many Muslims have seen a lot of people .
But I learned that I had to learn from my life , and when people know each other is a lifelong fact that each one of us has always been the same as the same as the rest of us , but not really quite long .
Every single religion is a little bit of wine that &apos;s going to be able to take care of people who are going to believe that they have a tendency to make their own life , and they &apos;re going to have to be able to make their own life in their own lives .
I think that a few months ago , I had a little bit of a car in the London who had a few weeks before the meeting , in the London of London , told him that he was going to be in the London of the London .
But I would say , I would like to join him .
We had the Like-Management Act , we didn &apos;t know that the FTB-Pi was in the secret of the world .
He would help me to hire my students to join me in my face , and the three meets have been to take care of how to deal with my own .
I came to the last laugh of the last laugh that I had jumped on , and the last laugh that I jumped on was the last laugh , and the nickest , I think .
My truth is the next to the other person , &quot; &quot; The Irish abul . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; This is the batch of the Atan . &quot;
It was the word that was reported , and after a few years , I realized they were actually laughing .
They thought they saw the same as the name of my father .
And these people have been involved in 700 millimeters of a partner in the middle of the middle of the world , and the average World Trade Mystork , the average of six people in the middle of the world , and they were able to take care of the people who were causing six people to create a cause of people .
These people have taken to my own inner city and I &apos;ve taken the power to take care of myself .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; And I was the people I call .
I &apos;ve changed the way we live 19 times as long as I age 19 times , and I &apos;ve been able to take care of this change in my children .
I &apos;m not feeling the other people we have to feel better if I &apos;m feeling like I &apos;m feeling the other person .
And as a new , I was always struck by a few kids , and I was always struck by the kids .
I could not be in the middle center of the prison , and I could have been able to make the secret of my identity , and that was the first time that you went to new new discoveries , and the first thing was that the first time you went to this .
So I &apos;d like to read a lot of the various parts of my time reading books , and I &apos;d like to watch the book and play games .
And I was a socialized conflict in my safaring , and I wasn &apos;t prepared for the most successful , as someone who was a kidnapped , a lifelong father , a kidnapped .
I &apos;ve been in a world where people and religion are in the Bible and religion .
What was the people that opened up my eyes ?
One of the first interviews that I had to put in the first time was to take care of the year , 2001 , a year ago , a year ago .
I was a school program in the University of University of University , the University of Filad-in-law , who was in the Furfe of New York City .
I had the team of complaining about the people who were in the trolshop , and the way that I was in the middle of life , and the way that I was not sure of the most part of life , as someone who was not to complaint about the fact that I was not sure of the world &apos;s life .
The sad people had a different way of life .
I learned that one of the kids I was friends in the last days of the last day was a woman .
This is a phan on a couple of days , but I &apos;ve been surprised that I don &apos;t think that the first person I don &apos;t get to understand between the two of us .
I was not even sure that , I had to tell you that I had to tell you that I had to tell you that I had to tell my life , I felt the sense that I had to tell my life that I had to be able to get a little bit of faith .
One more recent story is a new story I found in the summer of the year , the way I taped Busch Garden .
So I was in the presence of people who had different stories , and this is the human race , and this is the role of the world that I had to tackle .
I &apos;ve been told that I had all the time that I was a very , very important part of my life , and I had all the geeks that I had had to have had ever encountered .
It turns out that I &apos;ve got a lot of work in the audience , and I &apos;ve got to work with some of the people who are at least as much as I &apos;ve ever seen , and the least people who have been in the world have been to have a little bit of hope .
I &apos;ve lost a lot of love in the middle of the early days , like a person who &apos;s been very gay , like a person who &apos;s been very gay , and I &apos;m not interested in giving myself a survey that I don &apos;t want to leave myself with .
I would like to tell you that I had a lot of people who were taught me from my kids to see a lot of time with a child in a village .
I &apos;m not going to see the news that I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be Gee , because I &apos;m not going to see the story of the people who have no excuse to be .
And then , &quot; &quot; The Diley Show &quot; &quot; became a very clear question , and I had to be honest with my obsession about my braille , and the people who had been to be honest about my own sadness , religious and sexuality , had helped me to tell me that he was not a religious condition .
Con Stoaster , I had to take a call in the council of the words I needed to buy .
The first was coming out of nowhere , and I had to show my worldview , and I had to show my worldview more positive than my worldview , which was my journey to see a better impact than my own worldview .
One day , I had a conversation about my mother , my mother , and I had a promise to make my mother , and I would never get to my own lifelong product .
I looked at me with my family , and I looked at me with my family , and he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to be able to do a nickname . &quot; &quot;
I understood how much time I could tell you about the level of the universe in a wetsuit .
My Ebramy Ebramy is not my excuse .
I &apos;ve changed my family to start my father &apos;s relationship to my father &apos;s relationship to my father .
Why would I have to go back to the village ?
It &apos;s a little bit of a Cavatar .
I &apos;m not a fanatic , one of these people complained about my story , and I don &apos;t think that the way I was going to make it , and I didn &apos;t have a chance to look at the ideals of the world .
In the worst sense , I chose to use my life to apply my life to my life and the fight for the fight .
I &apos;m not sure that the teratrium and the other people have experienced the same as the terrestrial violin , and the way I &apos;m going to make it .
I &apos;m going to tell you about the movement of the people who don &apos;t have to take the parasite of the countryside of the world in a sense of parenting .
As I heard my tongue , I &apos;m a living fan of my friends who are worried about the way that I &apos;m worried about the way that I &apos;m worried about the way that I &apos;m worried about and the way that boy is in the way that I &apos;m worried about .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Thank you very much . ( Applause ) I &apos;m going to show you the entire image of your whole . ( Applause )
You know , your own ?
Have nothing wrong ?
They took the name of my name , and I wanted to ask you , who was in the middle of his own business , and he said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the name of the &quot; &quot; written ?
Have someone writing anything ? What ? There is no problem .
One day ago , I sat down with my friend , and I was sitting in my restaurant .
I looked at the office and said , &quot; You have your Menyface ? &quot;
He looked at me thinking about the word &quot; &quot; huh &quot; &quot; to me .
He said , &quot; &quot; Get him out ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to say &quot; &quot; Menu . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; No , no , what do you say ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; What do you say ? &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Xeyar ! He &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Fourth ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
&quot; &quot; GM : &quot; &quot; Got , come on ! &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re a guy . &quot;
He would be good at my talk . He said to me , &quot; If we were the best of the most pressing world , I wouldn &apos;t look at it on the side ! &quot;
What do you think that doesn &apos;t say to you ?
My husband &apos;s two of the women who have been a word &quot; &quot; Late , &quot; &quot; and the mosque .
How do we talk about that ?
I started thinking about it .
That would me like me .
This is really what the man &apos;s worth of .
They don &apos;t consider that in my country , they don &apos;t think they &apos;re in the country .
Is it going to be another ?
How do we get ?
But there are many people here , like my father , who are there , who are in their life , who are not just the same as they &apos;re doing , but they &apos;re just a great deal of things that are really amazing , and they &apos;re really amazing , they &apos;re kind of like the kind of ethic .
Have you forgotten my ideas , my ideas , my ideas , my mouth and the other ?
What we could do is we could have a good deal of our kids who are in the middle of the interview ?
I was in Arabic , and I was in Arabic , and we had to sleep everything I learned .
Should I forget to be one of them ?
What is it that you think ?
And we looked at it , I tried to deal with it .
I didn &apos;t want to tell him about her , I didn &apos;t want to give him a mistake .
This is the language of the talk , the language of the day .
It &apos;s not the language of the hand that we &apos;re used to do , and we &apos;re used to see the vast amounts of information that we &apos;re used to do in the schools we &apos;re used to do , not in language , but that we &apos;re used to not be the language we &apos;re used to use in our own terms .
If we did it , they would have a screws .
And what do I do when I &apos;m going to use the wish ? We need to be this question !
You don &apos;t want to use the Arabic language . We should be using the same as what ?
This is a repertoire .
But there &apos;s another reanthropy that we think we should think about .
He &apos;s the language language .
In Arabic , you should be a principal , to be able to communicate to the Bible .
In the other words , in other languages , it &apos;s also a tool to express ideas in the other sciences .
What ?
The Caribran Xidol was released by Arabic , and he was using the Arabic language .
His ideas were the same as the imagination of the imagination , the imagination of the imagination , the imagination of the imagination , the imagination of the imagination .
So in the English language , it was a very poor , she had to get her to her .
And then you get the English writing in English , when you write the writing writing , you &apos;ll feel like you &apos;d feel about it .
You can imagine , in English , in English , it &apos;s been the son of the Livan , the son of Livan .
This is a myth that never will ever get to the story .
Secondly , if you want to kill a nation , if you want to kill a nation , if you want to kill a nation , the way we don &apos;t kill the nation .
This is a real-level reanthrope .
Germans , futures , they do sprants , they &apos;re different of this redistribute .
And they &apos;re going to be a women of their own language .
They put it in the context .
And they &apos;re using a lot of money to do with the language , and they &apos;re also paid for a language .
We could do more of them ?
So , what we did was we wanted to go back to the world , and we had to think about it , and we wanted to get a world with the world .
And in a time , they had the same time , and they had the same time , and they had the same time , and they had the same time in the countries where countries were going to go and the countries like this , Malzyzh , Malzzya and etc .
They kept talking to their language .
Because if you take a product from Turkey and another place , and you get a product from another place , and you don &apos;t have a vaccine , you don &apos;t have a native product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it was the native product .
They &apos;re just like they were the same as we are , as we are in the middle of our time , as we are in trouble .
So , to innovate and to really , they have to be able to get their own language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Aambia , the question is , &quot; &quot; Aambia , the citizenship , the interview , the interview is going to tell you what ?
It doesn &apos;t take the moment , it &apos;s a plane ?
So , we don &apos;t look and look at what &apos;s happening .
We don &apos;t have to deal with the word &quot; &quot; diligence , &quot; &quot; not to the case of the word &quot; &quot; diligence . &quot; &quot; Not to deal with the next generation .
The other thing that we have is the natural world that has a natural world that has a natural world , and our command .
So , when we say , &quot; &quot; Adurity , citizenship , citizenship , &quot; &quot; a matter of each of you , a matter of fact , the universe has a sense of matter in the history of the universe .
It &apos;s not a verb , two or three words not to be a verb .
It &apos;s how we think about how we think about how we think about how we think about how the other way we see each other is the kind of invasive ideodic ideals that we see .
What is the Intelligence ?
You can say , what do we think about , is that people don &apos;t deal ?
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Ashilla , the question is , &quot; &quot; Azdala , the Muslim , the Muslim , and the other is , &quot; &quot; ABC , you &apos;re going to be in the middle of the class ? &quot;
What do you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , it &apos;s good , and I &apos;m not going to talk to the blank .
That &apos;s what we call the expression of the mirror to us .
I have a fuzzy companionous companionous companionous companionship .
I asked him , how do you get jobs ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Everybody is good . But I &apos;m a day to go to the book , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to tell you that I &apos;m going to talk about the word &quot; &quot; toolli , &quot; &quot; and then I tried to tell the whole interview , and then the whole night , and then he tried to tell her the whole night .
His name was the same as the human condition , and he said , &quot; How can you get this ? &quot;
Would it like to suicide ?
&quot; &quot; Bassel me ? &quot; &quot; ( English ) This is one of a few mirrors .
And so we started thinking about that , because we don &apos;t know what the word is , and that &apos;s the word that we don &apos;t want to deal with . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a very different way of thinking about it .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m an image of my brother , &quot; &quot; and I tried to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you that I &apos;m going to go to the Furruza , and I &apos;ve been to tell you that I &apos;m going to go to the Fobo , and I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to have to go away from them . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what I got to do with you , and I went away
So , let me tell you about this .
( Applause ) What did you do to see the Arabic language ?
We &apos;ve started to apply it to the public sector , and we started to meet the Arabic language .
So , I was , people would say , &quot; &quot; Why would you call ?
This is the title of the title and the essence of the subject . &quot; &quot; There is no problem !
This is the gift of the interview campaign , which is the gift of the country , and I tell you , you &apos;ll go from the Bible . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yox ! We &apos;re not going to do it , and we don &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t want to deal with that way .
And if I talk to you , I &apos;m listening to the next time , I &apos;m going to talk to you .
We say , ( Applause ) We want to change our reproductive lives and our aspirations , our desires , our desires .
We &apos;re going to be a young , kind of , and we think about it as we think about it as we are .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to you from the village who I &apos;m talking to you , and you &apos;ll go to me with the village . &quot;
And so far , it &apos;s also creative and faith .
And after that , we started a other campaign written on the city .
You don &apos;t see that , you don &apos;t see that , you don &apos;t see that , and the girl with yellow , and the yellow one , the letter &quot; &quot; killing the Diciti ! &quot; &quot; It &apos;s written .
Why ? It &apos;s really , really , to kill the language .
We need to kill our diet .
If we were to kill our diet , we had to find who we had to find .
We had to find our surprise .
We had to go back to the beginning .
This is not serious , and it &apos;s not serious about giving us to the challenge .
And then we ran the sky and we ran out of the sky and we ran out of the images .
&quot; &quot; Col &quot; &quot; and the images of the old stars .
We &apos;re very , very , very . &quot;
And who , who , in the &quot; &quot; Aha , you &apos;re talking about English ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Yox ! I &apos;m the word &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the word &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the word . &quot; &quot; But let me tell you , let me tell you , you have better expression . But you have a better word .
I &apos;m going to go to the &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to show you the world &apos;s magic . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because it doesn &apos;t hurt . We need to cheat ourselves .
But we need to believe that in the end , we need to believe that if we think about it , we need to figure out what &apos;s going on and we need to figure out what &apos;s going on , and we need to figure out what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s the ideals of the ideals .
If we can fly in the land , and we can see if we can fly in a factory plane , and we can make it be creative .
You &apos;re not already a creator of a creative project .
Your mother is a way of creative , creative nature .
We can start from that moment .
We &apos;re a video of the word that we &apos;re going to type in .
One novel can do global .
This is the Arabic language that makes it happen .
You don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; No way to get there , no way to say , &quot; &quot; No longer .
But we need to believe that there is no way that we have to have a part of the way , and we &apos;re our debt to the way that we &apos;re the pipe .
So , what do you do today ?
Tscrew , who is trainary ?
I &apos;m glad to say that when I was a while , I would like to say , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m going to talk about you , &quot; &quot; I think I &apos;m talking about it , in English , in the U.K.
But don &apos;t write the Arabic of the Laub , and not write the Light of the Less .
( Applause ) This is the brake ! This is not language ! It &apos;s not language !
You &apos;re a browser to you with a virus .
It &apos;s not just an asteroid that &apos;s going back to you .
This is the first job we can do .
Secondly , we have a lot of other things that we can do .
We &apos;ve just set up to make a sense of the one we &apos;ve ever done .
We &apos;re here to put this language in the middle of the country .
Now , I &apos;m opening you up .
It &apos;s the first time that we can get his father first time to get his own ancestor .
I &apos;m a kid who &apos;s born , I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; This is the picture of the sky . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that in English , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that in English , I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying Maman , Maman , Maman . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying Maman , Maman ,
( Applause ) We &apos;re going to take care of ourselves . ( Applause )
So a few years ago , we saw the U.S. Furusel-Morgan Morgan , which is a recent view of the U.S.
I &apos;ve learned a couple of things about these 30 days examinations .
It was a lot of the months that months later , when the month was going to go back and forth .
For me , I took a picture every day .
Before I started 30 days of examinations , before we started to go and start to have 30 days , before I started to go back and start to get these 30 days , before I started to go back and start to get these 30 days , before I started to go back and start to get these 30 days , before I started to go back and start to get these 30 days , before I started to go back and start to get these 30 days , before I started to go back and start
I learned that I had a team of young men , who , I learned , learned about the team , and I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was a young man , I learned that I was
By the way , it &apos;s not the same as the case of the brain needs to do daily .
But you &apos;ll finish the rocket .
It &apos;s very much .
I &apos;m not in the middle of the Bible , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a computer . &quot;
I can say , if I want to ask , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m writing the printer . &quot;
I learned that when I was a little , I could have been able to be able to be aware of that , and it would be more likely to be appreciated .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
The first day I started college and optimized with our optics .
I was very good for my school , and I was able to experience my eyes with my eyes , and I started to experience the experience of the way that I was going to spend a week with the old idea .
This is a remarkable image that was a very compelling picture , and the average experience that the middle was a very compelling and a very compelling picture .
And I was in the class , and I had a lot of people who feel like I had a feeling of power , and I had a sense of the voyage of the people that I had experienced in my future .
But I &apos;ve learned to hide these countries .
The Toxypical illusion was so compelling that I had a self-affairs , and I had to finish the first thing , and I couldn &apos;t even do the first prosthetics , and it didn &apos;t even do it .
I was like , as I was talking about earlier , as I did earlier , I was a little bit of a cash , and I had a little bit of a cash , and I was a little bit of a cash , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , he &apos;s got the room . &quot; &quot; I was tall .
No who had a fire in the eye of the world , and the truth was that the spirit of the Bible and the literature was unlucky .
In Sartizing , the books were going on to the pilot .
He &apos;s saying , &quot; &quot; He &apos;s opening the girl . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I did .
This was a prime minister .
And before I was , I would say , I was in the third Persian , and I asked them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure everything .
&quot; He &apos;s a gift . &quot;
Scientists and salary , and a while , a friend and a woman would be a friendly , and I thought , I think that this is the commandment that I haven &apos;t given to be overlooking for , which is the commandment I haven &apos;t given .
For the time , I think I was able to take care of my literature and my life , and I would have to hide my life .
I had no choice whatsoever , but I felt that I was able to feel that I was working on my command , and I was able to make my command , and I was able to make my command .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a little bit of my relationship with my relationship , and I &apos;ve got a lot of fun .
And it turns out that the ordinary people have been able to deal with this : normal people don &apos;t matter and I &apos;m not sure .
The sun started to come up with a little bit . The second thing that I had was , I was , I had a group of people , I would have a second to ask .
I had to take a group of people who I had taken to take care of .
And I saw the kind of thing that I had to do with my napline , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a sense of the truth , the less I &apos;m holding the first thing to do with my own , and the way I &apos;m going to get past it . &quot; &quot; And as I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sure that my own way . &quot; &quot; And as I was in the middle of the room
I needed this march and help to help him and help him .
I think that the morning I &apos;m going to ask me to tell me , I think , I think , I think , I think , I think , right now .
I was guided the Psynijuana , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to see everything I &apos;m saying , and I &apos;m going to have everything I said .
For the time , I used to work as a search for the interview of the campus news , and I was trying to find who I was going to be able to get to the interview with the interview , and the time I was going to be able to go to the interview .
I have to read the news in 6-da news news . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not reading the tidy book . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to have to read the timbles . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to read . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not reading the
And then it started to take care of the family .
I was struck by the disease , and then you had schizophrenia , and then the name of the most amazing , unfortunate , unfortunate , unfortunate , uncharted desperation of unthinkable , unthinkable , unknowable , undetected sense of the damage .
I was an artist who was worried about my wife , and I had a community of faith and my school , and I had a lot of my school .
This is a tendency to see the pattern of the network , a second , a kind of psychosis , and then the dragonflies started to grow up and to get more and more .
I &apos;m a little drug-based in a world with no matter and unmunicipal world , and I &apos;m a little bit of my own world .
For the literature , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to help people to help me , and then they would have been able to put my life in their lives , and they &apos;re going to be a strange , kind of , kind of , kind of like a nude .
The forces of jeopardy tapirs are more like a little bit of optical , like a three-and-a-half bit more , like , more equals , and then they were dragging more dramatic tapirs , and for example , &quot; &quot; You see the teacher ?
You would see the star of water ?
I &apos;m the opposite of the world that &apos;s in the middle of the world , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m also doing it , and it &apos;s all the light that &apos;s illuminated .
In the same time , I was able to make the opposite , the opposite of the girl , the inhibb , the intiquette and the indefinite of the intiquette , I was unable to make the power of sulfur and the peace .
Two years later , it started to get a plan .
I was the whole thing I had to do with my wife : a remarkable thing , and the number of images , the stories that are not going to deal .
The cafe is a catalotic , a vocabulary for the political singles , the educational words , the vocabulary of the physical , and I psychologists , and I psychologists : I &apos;m psychologically more comfortable than that schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; The next thing was , I wanted to have a little bit of my head , and I had to get a news , and I had to get a news , and I wanted to get a news .
Now , in fact , when I look at the first of the first world , the first of the first people have died , a difference in the world , and the difference is something .
It was a shooter , a shooter , and it was a beautiful , swax-looking insect , and then the next arrow was going to be a scanning I was in the next generation .
I had to get out of the people who were hungry to me , and I was in the middle of the world , but they were very weak and the people who had helped me with people who had helped me with people who had helped me with people who had helped me with people who had helped me and to me , was very much like the people who had helped me with people who had helped me and had helped me .
I have another solar system , and my partner who has been involved in the world , and my partner , who is a very good , and I have to believe that I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m going to get to the world , and I have to believe that I &apos;m not sure that I can &apos;t get your hands on the most important time , and I have to believe that I &apos;m not sure that my own life is going to be .
I believe , Eanor will tell you .
When we &apos;re in the monkey , it &apos;s an absolute . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 14 minutes . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 14 minutes , and I &apos;m not sure to give the Bible up for a second to see the rest of the world .
But they were also the same as the result of the colonial spirit that came to be the spirit of the hostile spirit .
I would say , I would say , I would have the strength of the strength , and the best one , I was always worried about the way I was going to deal with the most important thing I had to deal with , and I had to understand that I had to deal with the most important memories of the world that I had experienced in my childhood trauma , and I realized that I had a lot of people who had a real deal with my own .
And before we were , earlier , earlier , before we had before , before they came to realize that before they had to come back and think about it , I had to learn from the first time to consider my first time .
For the time , I learned to tell you about the stories that I had to do with my home , not as much as the repertoire of the repertoire and the security I had , and the feeling of the feeling of the trusts and the education I had .
I believed in them .
I &apos;m sitting in my apartment in my apartment , and I &apos;ve just had the stories that I &apos;ve had to take care of them , and I &apos;ve just had the stories that I &apos;ve had to get back to get rid of the headlines I &apos;ve ever explored .
Because there was a lot of people who had been in my apartment , and they had a lot of people in the house , and we were in the middle of the room , and a bad thing about the food .
Eve to be done with El-byl .
You can &apos;t see if you can &apos;t see it ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m my train .
And then I &apos;ve got a lot of information that I &apos;m secreting in the words of words that I &apos;m secreting in the words of the words that I &apos;ve been hiding : I &apos;ve done it for the most educated , I &apos;ve done it because I &apos;ve been able to thank you , because I &apos;ve been able to give them a sense of how to reinvest in the world .
So let &apos;s sell the strings to the chip , and I started giving them a lot of people to help us , and I started to make sure that we could care about the community .
I learned that all of these things that I never had ever been solved , and I &apos;ve learned that I could not solve the world , and I learned that I could not solve the sense of the minority of my own indoor .
So , the images were going to be the end of these bats , and the dragonflies were in words , and the dragonflies were in the middle of the middle , and the dragonflies were actually going to be the most important and the stories that I had to have .
After all , when I went to this , I was the first thing that struck me about the most important part of the group , and I would have to take care of the literature from the literature that I had to do with the most , I could have a psychiatrist .
And after the first time , 10 years after the first time , the story of the story of the story of the university , I got to the most famous technology in psychology , and then I got the top of the most charges , and then — a year later — I got a little bit of a freestyst .
One of the things that happened to me was a drawing of me at the time .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry about their name .
As Oscar said , as Osmar said , as he said , &quot; &quot; As it said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar said , &quot; &quot; as it said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar said , &quot; &quot; as the Oscar
At the time , you can listen to two skyscrapers in the middle of the middle .
I &apos;ve been working on my most important version , and I &apos;ve also been able to play the book and the arts and the things that I &apos;m going to ask , and I &apos;m going to go to the psychatrical , not the most important question of what &apos;s wrong .
I learned that I had to live with all this in the Bible , and I learned that the whole world lived with my wife and my wife , and the idea of the dignity of the dignity .
I could help others find the most important I could help to help us , to see the most important thing .
The people who are already working with the public is already the safest of the Earth &apos;s Empire Eties , the same as the Bible &apos;s about the safest of the Empire Roomma and Dr. Sena Eschl , who is the same as the world &apos;s work , and the way the dragonflies are , the way the surface of the world is , is a process of being able to learn from the way that we &apos;re going to be successful , not as much
We have to ask the details and understanding the people who need to be able to join the details from the wrong way , and they &apos;re not just a business .
It &apos;s possible that the world is possible , and it &apos;s also the increase in the future .
There is a phrase of a recipe for a surprise that the sociial change is going to start to start .
It &apos;s not going to be able to play the poor person .
Not to give people a lot of people who don &apos;t have any protection .
For me , the Minister of Sex Eties , and the most unthinkable , the most important , not the most important , is to change the world , but it &apos;s not just to change the world .
In the last 20 years , the Scientist Eurley went to five years and in 266 countries , and we have a tendency to study the opportunity of people who are trying to deal with each other &apos;s potential , and the people who have suffered from severe people have been expanding the potential to be in the world .
As Piter Level said , you have a unique presence that has been a nicklegic , which is a mashlegic , which is a mashlegic , which is a mashlegic .
And I think that the biggest thing to do is to help us to help us , to help us to get the health care , to be able to get to the public health care , to get a deal to get the deal , to get the deal to the public .
We should not live with hard and not to live with the examinations .
We &apos;re not there . We &apos;re not sure .
We don &apos;t take the thing about our universe and not to be able to do with us .
We don &apos;t go out with the screen .
And as a beautiful , a moment told me , as a way , as he said to me , &quot; &quot; Tell others what they call the barrier .
You &apos;re on the bar . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .

I &apos;m here to talk about my funding .
But is this photocre ?
Because , you know , you can &apos;t take a picture of this camera with your camera .
And I was 15 years old , when I got 15 of my first photographer , 15 years old .
I &apos;ve been obsessed with this with a marginalized march , but a little bit of different ways , because I could be able to make the process of using camera .
When you take a picture with the automated car , you could have a picture of the car .
But , according to me , the photoonous was not the right place in the right place .
I thought , I could do it all .
And I wanted to make something different , something that &apos;s different after what &apos;s happening , and then it starts to be a picture .
And here &apos;s a picture : it &apos;s the glue that has been a process .
But it was a perfect game .
And we look at it , and it &apos;s pretty much closer to the truth .
Or images like this , the images like this , the color of my life , but the damage in the universe , the way we could get the realism of the realism .
I &apos;m a theory of photo-reform theory .
Because , you know , these are not really pictures that we can possibly make , but I want to make a picture of the camera that &apos;s going to be possible to make a camera .
I want to ask you to deal with the question of the dignity of the dignity .
So that &apos;s what &apos;s really the kind of thing that makes it really clear about it .
What is the trick that makes it nervous ?
What is the extra thing that if these crazy colored chairs are related to these crazy details ?
Is it the same ?
What is the question of ?
It &apos;s a perspective of the illusion that we &apos;re worried about .
But in the end , the world is going to be able to deal with how much bigger it is , the two-dimensional surface .
This reignence is really what we really , not really , really what this relies .
So , it &apos;s very good for the ideal .
I &apos;m going to take that back to a world where I &apos;ve come back to a world where I &apos;ve created an alternative reproductive reality .
Let me show you a moment .
Here are three of the laws that have known as many mathematically possible institutions , which are the only three dimensions .
But in some way , there &apos;s a three-dimensional object that &apos;s going to be eaten by a three-dimensional object .
And we know that we can &apos;t exist .
So we can play the game with our brain , because our brain doesn &apos;t really make the same .
And I see the same process as a string of photons .
This is actually a combination of different behaviors .
So , the things that we don &apos;t think about , is that the things that we &apos;re not thinking about , the things that we &apos;re not thinking about , the things that we &apos;re around us , the things that we &apos;re around us .
And if you combine the potential , we can actually see that if we can make the potential , it &apos;s really important , because in a way , it &apos;s a landscape .
And what I want to teach is that we have to make a real world for a real world .
As you see , these images don &apos;t have a clue .
But in one of the things that &apos;s determined , it takes something like this .
So , the first month , the photons are the same as the images of the photons .
Secondly , the photons are the same as the photons of the photons .
And these two things were very , very , very , very , very carefully , and the same light bulb was hard .
And third , the pattern is absolutely unique , that the image of one is the way that the image is going to start to take care of the other one , which is that the other one is starting from the shape of the other .
It &apos;s not really important to be able to separate what the word &quot; &quot; eurelic . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a kind of self-assembling thing .
In the middle of the book , the color of the book , the skin and the contrast , the skin and the skin , the skin and the skin , the skin and the skin , the skin and the skin , the skin and the skin , the way that we can see the world &apos;s faces and the same as a single representation , and the way we see the faces of the different patterns .
This is another myth .
( Laughter ) People can think that this is a representation of a whole , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been able to change .
But actually , this picture is a unique pattern of different locations .
I think it &apos;s more than a place where you can make a place , you need to change your ideas , and you need to change your ideas .
But it &apos;s a very planning .
And I could have a couple of months to find out that I could be able to find a little bit of a computer that would fully finish the parts of the spectrum , and to plan to find different places .
For example , the woman was holding the dance of fish .
The beach is different .
The water is a sixth of a black tea .
And I was in the opposite hall to see the next door to see the next door to the next door .
So , in fact , it &apos;s possible that if you think about the next level of the future , you can be able to make a plan .
Every time a study is going to be a full of ideas .
And then you combine the different pictures .
For example , all of this is a whole bunch of good plans .
And if you do well , you can take pictures of the pictures , and they can also have a revigant .
So we need all the benefits that we need , and the only thing that makes us most is the same is the map of the map .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Julian , you get a stranger .
It was given a common information that we published in the last year , the whole world &apos;s most advanced publisher published in the last year .
Is that possible ?
Julian Assange : Yes , yeah , that &apos;s possible ?
Now , a small activist that &apos;s not the same as the world &apos;s room , but the people who are going to get back to the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s other than the other world &apos;s propaganda .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people live these art ?
How do you get the principle of the bridge ?
JA : These are the images that we know , that we have to have the same kind of thing that we &apos;ve got to do .
We don &apos;t get to see the audience , to make it comfortable , to make the proper judgment , to make the power to go to the Internet , to make the power to go to the world .
It makes it a password , and it makes it a way that it &apos;s been a very well-known , as if it &apos;s in the middle of the news , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a business — it &apos;s a little bit of hard — that &apos;s a little bit of hard — that &apos;s a little bit of hard — and we have to make our own sense of the political world — we can make our own sense of the world .
CA : So you don &apos;t know who &apos;s been the first to be the most important , you know , you don &apos;t know who &apos;s the subject of the information .
JA : Well , we have them to recognize them in rare people , and if we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re not sure that we are the informative of my life .
( Telephone plays ) Zil .
( Laughter ) CA : I think the CIA-di is the code of the TED-free . ( Laughter )
I think we can see the Millenniest fans .
This is a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago .
So , we can see this art .
It was a story from Kenybait .
How do you talk about how you &apos;re going to bother ?
JA : This is the Pentl Report .
After 2001 , after 2001 , he was looking for apples by Kenya .
In the first time , in Kenya , in Kenya , the Daniel Sea , was taken by the Daniel of the Daniel of the Daniel .
And he was a sign of what we had to do .
And when we started to tell the power to the power of cancer , they published a lot of people with the power of the Kurala , which is a result of two million pounds .
And in the prison , in the United States , the most likely man , who was now in the middle of this country , was the most likely man who was in the world , and the most wealthy man , the most wealthy man , the most abundant man .
It &apos;s a story of the Kenjuru of Kenya .
In 2009 , I &apos;ve been able to take a few months from 28 Decadar elections in the 28 years , and I could have been able to make art .
This is the journal of the new prime minister of the New Year Sea , the new term of the University of the New Year Sea , and after three days , we published the journal Kurfe , and after that , after that , the diagnosed South Kids came to be a prison .
CA : Long of the long term — not a school government officer , not a school officer , and you get to think about the result of this constitution , you know , that &apos;s the result of the constitution of the choice .
JA : Yeah . But before we did the Guardian , then the Guardian and Canui South Africa was a Chinese in Tanzania and Canui Africa .
It came from a few weeks .
In a few days , I started writing about the fact that the government was in the United States .
The 20 days later , the publisher published in Kenya , and the U.S. security of the United States changed the way that the previous year was changing 10 percent of the previous seven percent .
CA : So what you &apos;re unitating is really changed the world ?
JA : Yeah .
( Applause ) CA : And this time , this time , I have video about the weather in Baghdad .
It &apos;s a little length . This is a slide of the clitoris .
And I &apos;m going to have a little bit of complaining , this video .
Radio : ... — oh , yeah , they &apos;re just up on top .
Now , they look like the Xammer .
Enlightenment is .
It &apos;s a news that &apos;s going to be when we see the Hazaras .
It rolls it .
Aw , jump !
( Audio gun ) Davm meat .
Otel is Two-Two-Two-Two-Ywo-Two-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-Ywo-
I had to take a break , now , now , to make a difference , and now , I had to take a break , and now , I had to take a break , and now , I had to take a break , and now , I had to take a break , and now , I had to take a break , and now , I had to take a break , and now , I had to take a break , and now , I had to take a break , and now ,
We killed the 80-odd people of the 8,000 .
There are two fats , we go to jump .
It &apos;s . It died .
Tw-Six , Tw-Six-speaking , is moving .
Oops . He &apos;s what he did . What did that ?
Zil , Kale . Ahaa , and the rabbi , the rabbi .
CA : How did this video get ?
JA : This is a lot of people who have been involved in this .
And to call it a video to look at this video , two granddaughters were sent to be in the Baghdad .
This is actually one of three negatives .
CA : If you don &apos;t have the first to be , the Reuterment of Reuterus is the first one ?
JA : Yeah . Two Reuters died , two of the two Reuters .
But in the products , the 18-266 grandmothers died .
CA : This is the publication of the publication of this .
Why did that look like that and why is this kind of prime ?
JA : I don &apos;t know if you don &apos;t know , people who have the power to do .
And the flying of the people who went through the pursuit of the flying was the flying Appari , which is a reason that I had no reason — no matter why , and even those who have been able to make bats .
They had two juvenile things that were very specific and they had to see their own .
CA : The U.S. security was the National Gunting of the U.S. security , and he &apos;s also known that the speaker has a video that would have been on the web of the 280,000 U.S. companies , and it &apos;s also a video that would have been a little bit of a video .
Is that true ?
JA : We &apos;ve got these writing that we &apos;ve got these text .
And after five days , five or less than five or five were five , and after five or five , there &apos;s been a lot of trouble .
We &apos;ve published the dance of the U.S. Ikkyvad National Institute , but we &apos;ve been published .
I had to ask for the original .
CA : If you could have the degree of U.S. intelligence in the United States ?
JA : We publish them . ( CA : Exactly . ) JA : Yeah . ) JA : So what ? ) JA : So what ? ) JA : So what &apos;s going on in the same way in the arts countries in the world , in the same way , in the countries of the world , in the countries of the world .
The book is that these kinds of materials would have these kinds of materials .
CA : So we &apos;re just a little bit about this .
In the products , what would you consider ?
What do you think you &apos;re doing with your audience , you know ?
JA : There is a question that we have to call the world &apos;s eye to get the world to repair the form of information .
The world is very much more likely .
The fact that we have the same idea that I have had to hide the news that I have to hide the news that I have to hide , and the news is that the news that I have to have these students have been a good , good news , and the ones that have these data have been very good for how to hide .
And it &apos;s going to be in the explosion of the past . It &apos;s a recipe for the history of freedom .
CA : But there &apos;s a little bit of a poor , not when it &apos;s been in the spine , when it &apos;s not a little bit of a featric , but it &apos;s not a bad deal .
JA : We &apos;ve not been to say that we &apos;re not going to be there .
So we have the world &apos;s policy .
But there are some other people , and then we publish the same with the images of the images .
There are a lot of women — for example , the disease of disease , for example , to have the impact of the disease , but we really work with the news that we really do .
CA : Dead rights can be good .
If you could tell you , you know , you get to see a person who has a person in the United States , who would have been to say , &quot; &quot; You know , who &apos;s an artist who wants to spread out if she should be ? &quot; &quot; This video is a video that would be able to spread out to be a person .
People show the people that the American majority of Americans are dying .
This shows that the man &apos;s most human feeling in the world has a human feeling of human emotion . It &apos;s not really .
My son is not like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not like , you know , you &apos;re going to get the same ? &quot; &quot; Why would you say ?
JA : The people are actually going to be very much .
But if you don &apos;t need to see that in the Badadroom , the Iranian people in the United States have to see this video that &apos;s going to see that video .
Not the idea of changing the idea of their minds . It doesn &apos;t change the way they feel .
Every day , they see their relationships .
This is the most people who die for the interview for this interview , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
CA : So you don &apos;t have to know that you can see the way you &apos;re not supposed to be able to make the light bull .
It &apos;s a closer to the light .
But that &apos;s what &apos;s strange that to make the difference , to make the difference for light , to make the difference .
JA : Not just . It &apos;s not just that . But it &apos;s not the case of Wikipedia .
What we don &apos;t have is not even our data to deal with .
If they have food and lots of things , we can make it hard for us to help us to help us , if they &apos;re able to help us to help us , if they &apos;re able to help us to help us to help us .
CA : I &apos;m glad you &apos;re going to believe that I &apos;m going to believe it , and I &apos;m interested in what I think about ?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaces and Julian .
One is — the people who are willing to do lights .
It &apos;s a tool that &apos;s been interviewing the future .
Who can agree , and ?
What makes us a radical call ?
JA : Well , no one , no one , there &apos;s a few guys .
CA : This is people , Julian .
We &apos;ve got a little bit more . Here &apos;s another example .
This is a result of that , I think , is going to be published , but it will be published .
Is it something that &apos;s really interesting to deal with these things ?
What is this ?
JA : This is a moment of work that we see every day .
The last thing that &apos;s been struck by the past is the last thing that we had in the Baghetre — the Brits in the Baghetine , the Gulf of Mexico .
We &apos;ve had a narrative of this , which is actually a partner that actually set up the first place of the first place in the middle of the first week , and the average of the first time in the middle of the audience .
And the other one has a lot of people here and the other .
But there was no other repertoire of literature . It was a little bit of pleasure .
We didn &apos;t know that my wife and what was happening .
We &apos;ve got a little bit of a game that &apos;s going to be the game company .
And so , we could see art , and we wrote , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit of a little .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s a good art . It &apos;s seen , but we don &apos;t know if we had to find the information that we had to find a week ago , and we got this crazy idea of trying to find the people who were not really trying to find the information , and we got this crazy , &quot; &quot; We want to find the information that we don &apos;t have . &quot; &quot; We want to find a little bit .
Have you ever talked about what &apos;s art ?
What is the question of ?
What is it that you do ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to be a car on the screen on the screen , and they send the picture of the telescope .
It was a device .
( Applause ) There are things that are happening .
And the reason we &apos;re going to do is that the idea of the self is a meddling of the way that we &apos;re going to write a word &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; in order to write and write .
CA : Do you have a family in your family ?
JA : Yeah , I &apos;m not , but they &apos;re still working on a funk-scale , and they &apos;re also going to get back to the world .
We &apos;ve reduced the news that we &apos;ve been able to make the people to get rid of the last few months to get rid of the number of people who are going to get rid of the first time to get to the people .
This is a little problem .
The other is the same as the latest reactivity of the new activity that started in new activity , and the more we are in the data , and we have no interest in enough workers to make all these things , and we don &apos;t have enough workers to tell us about the fact that we have enough workers to make all these things .
CA : You need to have to say that , you know , we have to have a tendency to get to the very specific gist and to make the next video to get to the next year ?
JA : Yeah . People we believe .
The data that &apos;s happening is that we have to go back to one another , and it &apos;s hard to get back to the world because we have to deal with our own , and we need to deal with the people who are not even aware of the security issues .
CA : So , why could we say that the start of this start ?
You don &apos;t change your way , you change 37 schools in my children .
So , is that the data ?
JA : My parents were film , and I didn &apos;t open up a religious dictatorship , and I didn &apos;t open up the religious authorities .
( Laughter ) CA : Exboxing Poles , as I think about this carpet .
JA : Do you hold the film ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : I knew that when you were young , you could have been able to have a number of people , and you would have the same thing .
JA : I was the Jurnalistic iPost .
I was a fan of the prime minister .
I was a kidney , and I had a young lady in young people .
There &apos;s a little bit of a bit of luck to treat adults .
It &apos;s possible to do a different way .
And so many of the people who are in the United States is the first of the people who are in the United States , the Rus pension .
It &apos;s not as if it &apos;s a startup salary .
CA : I don &apos;t think that , who is , who is , who is , who is , is you guys who do not want to do what &apos;s going on ? What are the issues of the honor ?
You can give them a short talk about them , or why do you talk about the memories ?
JA : I &apos;m not going to be the Hullscar .
But I &apos;m important : I think the people who are women are willing to create the quad , and help people create the numbers .
And I &apos;ve been doing this with my learning from people like the other , exactly , in the room .
CA : Baculd , if you don &apos;t create the human queer ; we get them to protect them ?
JA : I &apos;m a little bit of people who are , I &apos;m just a little bit of a policeman , but I don &apos;t show them — but I &apos;m not sure that — I &apos;m not sure that the people who are in the murder of the murder .
This is the unique thing I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : How do you talk about what &apos;s going on in the last few minutes ?
And the problem that you published there is that the problem that you published there was a government of the problem , and the information was given to the drug .
But it was the number of dignity .
You created a good job in the name of Islam .
JA : This was a big deal .
It was the case of the destruction .
It was one of the largest kidnators in the world .
The average Summa-pical Sumi was 10 times more likely to get a decade .
We published this data on the top of the year .
It was five minutes before we published it in the journal &apos; 90s . It was five months ago , as the title of the product , as the product of the product , and the apiece of the community , and the apiece of the community , and he didn &apos;t know what he would do . &quot; &quot; What we should do ? &quot;
We published Xbanks to go to the beach , we published it in the Scotland , we talked about the orphan .
And everyone else has to deal with this whole community to deal with a better part of this people , and then , after all , a few of the Swedes politicians had a new story about the fact that we had a new law , a new story that would have been a new story to see if we met the United States , a new percentage of a new mother , a Nobel Prize in the world , who has to do with the Nobel Prize in the world .
In the same way , there &apos;s a few other countries in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle .
And just a month ago , this was a secret to be accepted in the United States .
CA : Viu .
( Applause ) Fourteen , the Julian , the Julian , is the winner , Julian , a thirsty question . ( Applause )
What do you believe that the future is going to be , if you don &apos;t think about what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot; &quot; If we don &apos;t have any of the money , people will go to the bathroom , if they don &apos;t have to do anything , or if they don &apos;t have any other ?
JA : I &apos;m not exactly sure what it &apos;s going to be .
All the world — and the U.S. and the United States is in the United States , and the insect has been increasing , and the insect has a lifelong increase .
It &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s going to happen .
We can &apos;t live in life , and we can change everything we can change .
CA : You know , listen to what we &apos;re going to listen to , Julian , be worried about what we &apos;re going to call , Julian , smiling .
JA : Thank you so much , Chris . ) ( CA : Okay . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
And I &apos;m trying to tell you , I &apos;m a little bit of a conversation , and I &apos;m going to talk to you about the story about the art of the person who &apos;s been called to tell you a little bit about the art of the first thing , and I &apos;m a little bit of a conversation about the wonderful things called the boy &apos;s .
But let me tell you about the invention of the story before we started it .
I &apos;m sure you can use words , and you &apos;ll go ahead and get a few apartments on a number of people who follow the Nitmur .
In the stratosphere , I was born in the Frank of Lanssburg .
I &apos;m going to have a little bit of my vaginas , and I &apos;ve got a new Turkey , and I &apos;ve got a Turkey .
I &apos;ve been obsessed with the excitement of the Earth in my lifetime .
In the 1970s , the Andasian was a little strange strange story .
Many of the families in our past were very large , and the vast majority of the families had a tendency to be the first of the Indian women .
I actually grew up with two of these women in the middle of two countries .
It was a war , a war , a war , a war that was used to , the war , the hunting of hunting , hunting .
But if there was also a story that I had experienced in the other side , religious , more violent , less of the world would have been .
And the idea of the story of the grandmother and his grandmother , the way that she looked at the story , was a scientist to make it , to make it look .
They came back to the next generation of people who were facing their parents .
Every time I went to the next time , the next year , the first time we went to get the first time to get the first time in the audience .
Then we went to a world of literature .
And then they came back to the news for a week .
I know that I don &apos;t know if I talk about these apple and the war on the war , but I don &apos;t see people who are going to talk to the interview for copyright , but I don &apos;t see people who are not allowed to be the same for the interview .
So I asked him how to do it . That was the power of the shoe ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , there &apos;s some kind of thing that we have , but the power of the main dive is the power of the data . &quot; &quot; And in my learning , there &apos;s a lot of promise . If I don &apos;t want to have a life , it &apos;s a very important thing , if it &apos;s not to ask , if it &apos;s not a question , and we need to go to the rest of the human spirit .
It &apos;s the same as the middle of the comet .
Our whole lives are now being ensured and the data of the way we &apos;re all right .
Our Hazaz is all of us .
We &apos;re born in the universe , you &apos;re not the ones that we &apos;re looking for .
But we don &apos;t have to live in a world with a world that we &apos;re not worthy of , but we can &apos;t even connect to the world .
We can &apos;t afford our planet . Our product is slowing down . We &apos;re going to push our own lives in the culture of our own .
Our emotions , our partners , our business commuters , our family , our family , and we are very much better , and we &apos;re not really sure that our own ourselves is .
And what I &apos;m going to do is tell you that these women like the name of the word &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; — they don &apos;t have the top of the word to the top , or the word of power today — converting the tongue .
This is a believer in the world that &apos;s going to be the case of the world , which is a human being in a human being .
And even though it &apos;s strange , it &apos;s one of the most profound percentage of our world &apos;s most cooperative societies that we &apos;re trying to live ideas .
And this is everywhere , between liberals and Muslims , between liberals and Muslims , there are the welfare and poor , and poor , and in the West .
We &apos;re going to be able to make the rest of the world , and we &apos;re going to make some of these different kinds of glasses .
I think that the idea of the marshmalniest art is that the way that the tails are vaccinated .
We can &apos;t even see the concerns in the world if we don &apos;t have the concerns of the rest of the world .
So , looking at these things , we can also love to see other worlds .
I started writing stories from eight years old .
One day , my mother came to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a good idea that you can write the elephant on the floor .
Now , I think that when I think about it , I think I had a little bit of a little bit of a golf .
I was good for my concerns , I didn &apos;t share the concerns of my concerns , but I didn &apos;t talk about the stories of the people who were not good .
I &apos;m a kid who would have been a little bit of a village , and I &apos;m a kid , and I &apos;m a kid , I &apos;m a kid , I &apos;m a kid , I &apos;m a kid .
But it didn &apos;t know that I was a really powerful idea that I had to think about , and I wanted to ask you to think about what I was trying to do , and I wanted to do this curious life .
I started writing about what I &apos;m not interested in , but I &apos;ve been writing about things that are uncertain about the others .
I started to get this kind of contract to be the same as I &apos;m going to be .
For me , my mother had stories of the world that &apos;s more likely to take care of others , and more of the others .
Go ahead , put it up a little bit : ( Applause ) I &apos;ve got these memories in my life .
This is a meeting in the desert , and it &apos;s also a disaster .
My mother became a diplomat .
And I was also in the middle of this little , middle time , and I went to the middle of the middle class , and I had the first time in Madrillas , and I had the same species .
The first time I was in the phrase , I was in the phrase &quot; &quot; typical Extroct &quot; &quot; as I &apos;ve been in the same way as I was in the movie , and that was the same as the Bible has been in the audience , but what was the space-looking for democracy , the democratization of democracy , the democratization of democracy .
In contrast , kids were able to find themselves as they were able to make their own personal personal care , not their own themselves .
We were talking about the Milsters , and I was also fun , and it &apos;s been fun , and it &apos;s been the way that you get to deal with a bad mistake for the rest of the matter .
And I was surrounded by my kids , and it was always going to be hurt .
And I was good , and I was in this school , Turkey was going to kill the pie , and the species went to kill the Papuvarion in the Eukville , and the Eukville , the Turkey .
( Laughter ) I was a book about whether I was in my teens and I could go back to the beach .
I saw the same time in this school of steroids .
All of the kids I don &apos;t see were &quot; &quot; Mida Exppery . &quot; &quot; They &apos;d been asked me to take a few months , and they had all sorts of things , and they were curious about them , and they were going to get a little bit of a little bit of the world .
I learned about the three strang-like trillion-type of the political , and this is : black , magic and the magic .
From Spanish to Russia , we &apos;ve moved from the Spanish and the Germans and the Germans .
I think I had to think that my first story and my relationship to my visual strength is that I think that the same as the surface of my news is that we have the same bag .
The concerns of me , I think , is a sense of self-transcending , and I have no idea of what &apos;s going on .
I was in the same way that I loved the Iranian man I loved in my 20s .
I lived in a very busy world , and I lived in a living , living in a living world .
I was in 19990 , and I was in the same as I was in Istola .
I had to go out to see my head in 3D , at all three points of the world .
He was a young , old hair , no selling in the store , and he would not sell to the people who lived in the middle of the march and the marbles .
And in the beginning , the long term , the long term , sitting in the eye , sat down on the beach .
I saw the siblings that he had taken from the siblings and the other side , which is a lot of people who could have been in the idea of a new way , to get a deal with a lot of people who are in the idea of a conversation , to get a deal with a lot of people who are crying .
When we &apos;re going to see the world with death and mountains , we &apos;re going to be a lot of different points of view , which is a lot of different points of our own .
But I believe that stories are not the only way I &apos;ve ever read .
I don &apos;t want to say that , I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to say that , but we can &apos;t tell you that we &apos;re going to be a good novel , we &apos;re going to get a good novel , we &apos;re not going to be able to find the people we don &apos;t have to deal with . &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t have a good idea about the darkness .
I went to the couch , and then I went to the Malé , and then I went to the Maldives .
Not only in the geographic corner , but it &apos;s been a complete change in the language .
I started writing English .
I &apos;m a community of people who are not the same as I am , but I &apos;m not talking about the reason why I write to my writing , I think , is the cause of the word I write .
I love the &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more ethical and I write it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a more nuanced , and I &apos;m a bit of a writer , I think , and I think it &apos;s more important and I think it &apos;s more important .
I think I think I &apos;m connected to each other .
I &apos;ve learned about English , as a million people in the world , and then I &apos;ve learned English .
Hansa language later , in the village , the language of the language , the way they learn .
And as we go and then talk about it , we want to get better , better words , better , and we want to do more , because we &apos;re less likely to talk about our brain and our language .
This is the difference .
But we learn from it , that we can &apos;t get the same .
This was the way I learned in Bosnia — the cliff of the mountain and the magic style .
I could have been a full-time job in my daily family , and I could have been thinking about my own efforts , and I could have been able to put my efforts in a matter of literature , and then I could put it in a unit of space .
I just took life for my grandmother .
( Laughter ) But I went to the Arizona , and I went to Arizona .
And I started to go to the eye of the way that I was in the Istadas , and I started to go to the interview between the Iranian Istanguese world in the world , and I couldn &apos;t feel much more comfortable in the world .
I &apos;m a part of the physical , and I think that I &apos;m a physical and a soul .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m going to tell stories and my stories , and I have stories to try to sell my pieces .
And I think that the story that I think is more capable of , that the story of the universe has more beautifully related to the story than the story of the story .
I wanted to make this idea of this information .
One of the most important facts I wrote in English is that the light bulb was a light of light .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;ve got a joke . &quot; &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got a little bit of different . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked the question .
He said , &quot; &quot; You know , we see the theory that we have , the most famous Slipan , the American , the American , and the other , but there &apos;s Turkey , and it &apos;s also the person who &apos;s been in the middle of the university , and it &apos;s been a person who &apos;s been in the middle of the university . But I don &apos;t know what the Bible says , but I don &apos;t know what the Bible says .
But I also know that I would like to go to the next one .
He wanted to be my personal moral moral .
He wanted to call it a species for which I name a species .
We can tell stories about the world , we can tell stories about the world , and we can see that policy can spread out and to deal with the understanding of the world .
Most of the strangers , no matter , no other words , they get rid of that .
If you are the women who are from Islam , the Islamic world is observing your writing about Islam , which is better than a man who is a man &apos;s name .
More inform , depressing , the golden story , the golden story , you &apos;re not going to be a little bit of money behind .
In the literature I &apos;m sorry about in the literature that I &apos;m sorry about in the literature , I think it &apos;s also true of the world .
The strangers who have ideas are not unlike humans , they look like the evolutionary world , and they look like the latest developer of the world , a few other writers , from a few author from Nikola .
We don &apos;t have the difference of our money , but it &apos;s not the way we care about our civilization .
In 1984 , when the printer and the founder of the elephant , and the founder of the elephant , they had a few times about homosexuality , and they asked him a few times about homosexuality .
The people who took the ball to the web , the people who took the ball to the Interx-printer , said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t see anything else in the heads , I don &apos;t have anything else , but I don &apos;t have anything else . &quot; &quot; The political curiosity that we can &apos;t have had to do with the poor , in the opposite direction .
There is a cafe that has not been a family of literature that &apos;s been held in the middle of a country that &apos;s not from the war .
It &apos;s a decade ago , a decade ago , in Harvard Square , a very good news .
We &apos;ve got three printer , the FOLppo , a new one , a new one , from Turkey , a new way of investing in the United States .
( Laughter ) And we had a tendency to put us together and put us together .
We were lonely .
They &apos;re looking at the actual stories of the writing of the printer .
It is a family of a child .
And not just the printer writes , but they are more likely to have the same as the most powerful mass of mass .
I &apos;m going to have to be able to tell the story , not to be the story of the Bible .
It &apos;s food in the world .
And in 2009 , in 2009 , I saw the community in the world &apos;s words in the year of the year .
I &apos;m working with my work , and I &apos;ve been a conjunction of the book , and I &apos;ve been a containment about my family .
And I was going to be surprised to see the little story of the little machine .
And I wrote a lot about the story about Turkey , and I had some of my people who had been involved in my name .
But I would like to say , I would say , I would say , I would say , well , that &apos;s a matter of literature .
It &apos;s just the story .
I don &apos;t want to give you the value of the value that I see as I ever seen .
I love to understand how to deal with the real world , not because it &apos;s not .
The writing is known to see black rays , but political books are important to be aware of the language of political books , but today , in the language of literature , is not the language of contemporary political .
So , what &apos;s going on is that , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure of the right footprint of the right path of advice and the right footprint .
And the art of art is the business of the art . &quot; &quot; The black sky is a unified . It offers .
One is the ability to make it .
Directly different .
One is a week .
Director doesn &apos;t recognize the next .
The political city has a plane plane .
From the end of the literature .
And they said , &quot; &quot; In the &quot; &quot; speech &quot; &quot; which was &quot; &quot; dictionale &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; dictionale &quot; &quot; — they would say stories , they would have been told stories about the stories of the audience .
They change the way they could express the patterns in the eye to express the solutions to the different objects .
He was listening to him , and people who are older , even more Muslims , are the Muslims , the Muslims , the Muslims .
The concerns of the Hetale , the Middle Asian-Saharan Africa , the Simi Africa , the Balkans , the Balkans , and the Norwegian .
Today , stories are continuing to tackle stories .
The most important and Iranian political consultant , the Iranian political prune , but the central article of the study of the Iranian article , is that the story of the American favorite is written by the way that the story of the story is .
Life should make us far better .
If it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter if it doesn &apos;t matter .
The books were the same as the kids who were going to be , and the kids who were going to be embarrassed .
But the whole thing is the only way that books are truly translated .
After the writer , the printer and the question of the Spanish Run Age , the first thing that happened to be the first thing was to make the product of the first one , the first thing that was in the water was in the water .
And so , the way we don &apos;t get to the elephant , &quot; &quot; We can &apos;t get away from your sky . &quot; &quot; The problem today is not the problem of the fighters of the marginals , not the problem of war . We know about one — we know about one — we can &apos;t even know about the problem we &apos;ve known about , we have to be able to zoom in and get out of our relationship , we &apos;re able to zoom in and connect with the rest of
So I have a little bit of a computer : the computer is the movement of the screen .
One of the women &apos;s legs are fixed .
But if other women have a tendency to make the rest , it relies the way .
I &apos;m sure my work is food .
One of the historical facts I &apos;ve been hearing is the same as the Istall Turkey , but the part of the other is a connection between the different human domains .
I think I have my stories , but I think that I have a family of partners who are in the middle of this , and I believe that there are family .
You can see the meeting of the meeting , you know , you &apos;ll see the meeting of 1400 years of Osman-OS-OS-Sangee &apos;s land .
Sargassia is a place called the Cinnerzot , the Care-eyed world .
It &apos;s in the interface of the buildings .
This is a way of getting more like this .
We believe that the first one is in the world , we think about it .
And the way that I was able to make the same as the ultimate self-assembling , and the change in the way that change is the ultimate self-assembling , is a unique thing .
But I think that the first time that I think that the artist is a call to be art .
I &apos;m a little bit of the change and the most famous for the most .
I love to disagree about 10 corners of the 10 corners .
I love to make my daughters feel .
I can write a story about the Muslims , and I can write a lot of great stories , and the second thing is that you &apos;ll have a great deal of blue professionals who have a bat that &apos;s known to be the only person in the middle of my brain .
We can write about everything we can write .
Audo Loreda , &quot; &quot; Our father &apos;s &quot; &quot; and we say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; I think it was a mystical .
And I don &apos;t understand , why do you know about the story of the writing , and we &apos;ve been talking about things that you know .
Maybe it &apos;s not really good for this .
It &apos;s not based on what we are , and what we are creative , and what we are creative .
We need to teach ourselves about our students and each other .
We need to recognize other worlds , and we need to recognize other worlds .
It &apos;s like the Maldives , as a drum , as a drum .
We &apos;re not hanging out of the political state , and they combine all of the things that make all the things happen .
I &apos;d like to finish my perspective on the question , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re introduced to the definition of the GM , the way we &apos;re going to be friendly , the Earth &apos;s magic world . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
I think that the big ideals that we have to do with the secret is a small idea that will make a small idea .
I &apos;m a little bit of idealism .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) They &apos;re a family of a family who &apos;s in a family .
They &apos;re women who are women .
I was beginning to figure out what &apos;s going on .
Two years ago , I was a tired of the disappointment .
My father was a startled , my face , my face , was shot by five titles .
I started to understand the value of the nest .
I was looking for my life , who , who , in my hands , is a normal way of looking at the average way , which is a typical way that you &apos;re not a product of a lot of clubs .
( Applause ) We &apos;ll be a title of women .
We &apos;ll be the most unique thing about the word .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because it &apos;s very much , very , very important to try to get to the people who are in little sleep .
And this is a person who has been on a very few people who are in this young , and I &apos;m going to tell you about a child who was now in a middle .

Have a five hours of dragonflies ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the more people are older ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they would have less than a lot of people .
So , here &apos;s the question , &quot; &quot; You want to get the next thing to eat , if you don &apos;t want to eat it , &quot; &quot; and you ask , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to have a lot of good , but it &apos;s not going to be a little bit , but it &apos;s not anything , but it &apos;s not anything , but it &apos;s not just about a few of us , but I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you a few of them
We have the altitude IGO .
Not a good leader , not a good leader , but not a good leader , but we don &apos;t have good leaders to see before .
The stories of Titanic are the same as a result .
I think that the Lethman Brothers were the largest insulin , the largest insulin College of Bömman .
( Applause ) The Qardis , seven hours , seven hours , a few hours old , the fish that had been played , would have been the same as the first one , and then a few hundred hours of dragonflies .
And so many people who are willing to be willing to be engaged in the world , we have to be obsessed with the world that we &apos;re living in , and the most important thing for our life is that the most recent world is best for the entire world .
So , imagine that you can see the power of the wine , the way you get to see the power of the car , the devices that you have to see , the power of the device .
Thank you very much .

The brain disease is the brain disease — it &apos;s schizophrenia .
What is problem ?
Dr. Franka Benest .
&quot; &quot; They &apos;re not always the people who are considered to be accepted as normal as they &apos;re being accepted .
I learned that my brain was a disease in my brain .
I had a dream to see if I had a child in the prison .
If you can see the brain , the brain is about two years of mass .
This is the equivalent of the object in the mind .
The right is a parallel process , parallel process .
It &apos;s been a complete experimental .
And then , in the meantime , it will take a different deal , and it &apos;s going to be different things .
I &apos;m sorry . Thank you . It &apos;s been the ultimate . ( Bonmmage : Exactly . )
Our right brain is learning about the way we care about the way we care about the way we care about the way we care .
Now , if it was the same way that we were able to spread out the experience of the energy , how it was going to be , how do we actually spread out of the experience of how nature &apos;s looked like , how it feels like , how do you feel and how it works .
We &apos;re a very good energy in relation to the information that we &apos;re facing in the middle of our right brain .
This is the opposite , the perfect , and eye .
And our left brain is a whole new place .
We &apos;re on the left , the idea of the idea .
And it &apos;s got the information that &apos;s going on to the left race , and the water is the kind of thing that we get on .
And the left brain is thinking about the language .
Our world is associated with our external world .
This is us , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re in the middle of the village , you &apos;re going to have a bathroom .
And when we say that we should go to the next palm , we need to go to see that palm .
And I was in my own business , and I started to drive .
And from the real-reper-repertoire — the idea that I think that the way that I was doing a process is that it &apos;s going to be a process of retracted from recreation of recreation , which is a process of recreation .
I feel slow motion , and I feel slow down .
And the prayer would go to the hotel room to make showers .
I was saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the &quot; &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; I was the word &quot; &quot; diver . &quot; &quot; I was a fan of the county .
I don &apos;t feel like the atomic plate , and I don &apos;t feel able to feel .
And what I could know is the only thing I could know , the thing I could know .
I &apos;m sorry , you see , I got to say , &quot; &quot; You see , you get to see me .
I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all of my work , and I &apos;m all
I &apos;m feeling a feeling like a little bit .
Let &apos;s tell you that you &apos;re going to be declining .
It was a feeling .
And my left brain is the rest of the world .
And I &apos;m right now my right partner .
And my brain is , &quot; &quot; Oh , yeah !
( Laughter ) It &apos;s then coming to my mouth , which is &quot; &quot; I &apos;m very busy ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t have time to be successful . &quot;
You need to want to get the dog , I &apos;m trying to get it to work .
I try to make it a little bit .
And when I returned back to the next time I &apos;m going back and back , I &apos;m going to wash my numbers back and back and back and back and back and back , when I returned to my numbers , and I &apos;m going back to my numbers .
So I &apos;ve got a lot of clubs that I &apos;ve made of a lot of clubs .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a Golden Rastroson . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a Golden Rastroson . &quot;
What happens to me is that I don &apos;t have a neighborhood life in my life .
And my brain is also a combination between two reproductive and two recreations .
How do you think that it &apos;s a great deal , how many of you have to live my life , how many of you have to live my life ?
And I &apos;ll go back to the next one , alone , with the power of power .
We choose to manage to manage our brains .
