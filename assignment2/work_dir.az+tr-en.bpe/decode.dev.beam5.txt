I was 11 years old . In the case , I was in the middle of the world that I was living in the middle of our home .
On the beach , the BBC Xny Xket was on the beach .
We had no usual suspected , because the news was on the surface of the news .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban got back ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He would say , &quot; &quot; The Taliban . &quot;
I didn &apos;t realize what this was going on , but I could see how my father was doing .
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go to the middle school . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to forget about it .
You go to the middle school .
I had six years old , when the Taliban had been in school for women , I was six years old .
So , after the next five years , I had to go out to go out to go out to school to go out and get rid of the world to go out and get rid of it .
That &apos;s our way we can &apos;t afford to train .
Every day we went to a different way , which is no matter where we go .
We &apos;d run our books out of our books , just say we &apos;ve got used to work .
It was in the middle of a house , like the 100-plus man , like a baton in the room .
I was comfortable in the winter time , but it was the opposite .
The teachers , and our governmentalists — we could have been able to preserve our lives .
Now , when the Taliban got older , it was a lifelong connection .
But we had to know what we knew about .
What do you see ?
Do you know what ?
We &apos;d like to hear , but it was the place we wanted to be .
And I &apos;m very lucky , because I &apos;m very lucky to take care of our education and their girls .
And my father was a man who was obsessed with her .
He insisted that she had a different thinking of a living village in the end of the night , and he insisted that my father had been denied by the father of her father , and he had been documented from his father .
But my mother had an education teacher .
Okay .
Two years ago , he took our home and converted our home to girls and girls .
And it was — that was the first difference in education .
They had no trouble , and they didn &apos;t know that her parents would take care of their kids , and when we look at the Taliban .
To her , she was more likely to take care of her children .
And in the Taliban , it would come back to me , and I would have been unable to see a light from the future , and in fact , we don &apos;t see a light from the future .
I &apos;m not sorry about everything . But the name is , &quot; &quot; Listen , I &apos;m girl , you can push everything .
You can make a fan of Pulun-Parn . You can &apos;t go to the wars .
But what I &apos;m going to do is take my dive into the middle of what &apos;s going to be , and if you want to pay for the middle school , we send it to the school and send it to school .
Now , I &apos;m going to have to go to you ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 22 years old .
I grew up in a country that has been distributed over 1,000 years .
I could end up about six percent of my vaccines in middle school , and if I had to finish my education , and if I was asked , I couldn &apos;t afford that .
In fact , I mean , here I am , in the end , is based on the College of Midaly College .
( Applause ) In fact , when I went to school , one of the first people who had the first to do , was my father who had the first to take care of girls , who had the first to take care of girls .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;m going to be the first girl who &apos;s going to come back to me with a makeshift car .
( Applause ) My family believe me .
I &apos;ve got my payload , the news for my family , the news for me .
Now , I &apos;m a good fan of a global campaign in the women of the global campaign .
Now , in a country where women go to school , in a country where women have access to school , I &apos;m SOLALO-ROLO-Frus .
And that &apos;s what I see is that I &apos;m going to see the facts that are available in the schools in schools .
And I see what I &apos;d like to tell you about , as my father , the father of their father , the father of my father , who has to take all the darkness , I see how they are .
Exactly . I can &apos;t tell you about it , and I don &apos;t know what it sounds like , but it &apos;s an ancestor of one of my activities .
A month ago , a few months ago , he took a few minutes from the SOLALO-den bombsight in his village .
He played phones in the middle of the tea , and on the phone , and on the phone , he would have been able to take care of her , to send him to school .
And then , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re sick , I &apos;ve got to die now , kill me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to fear the future of my daughter , I &apos;m not going to tell you about the future of my daughter . &quot; &quot; And what I &apos;ve discovered is that what I &apos;ve discovered is that what I &apos;ve discovered is that what I &apos;ve discovered is that it &apos;s based on the value of the United States .
That means that we don &apos;t have the chance of our suffering .
In fact , they are the ones who believe that girls are going to be able to take their ancestral future and make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to take care of their lives .
The number of girls in the Taliban have been measured by hundreds of thousands of years — as you know , this , as you know , this is an enormous number .
But there are many more than three million girls in the United States .
( Applause ) If you look at the United States , it &apos;s very different .
I understand what Americans saw in change change in change .
This is the equivalent of the United States of the United States of the United States , and after we &apos;ve got the U.S.
But when I came back to the World War II , when I was in the United States , kids and kids who are passionate about their parents , I &apos;m going to take care of a light bulb and a way to change .
For me , the Bible is the countries of the Bible , and the world is the country , and the girls who read the SOLOLO-da .
They &apos;re just like me , as I did .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to dive into the sea floor , and all of us can see if you go down and down for two half hours , if you go down and down for two half hours .
And you can see the bioluminescence here , but it &apos;s a world for art .
The eye is looking at the eye with a eyesight , a eyesight .
And that &apos;s the name of the company .
I &apos;m my favorable design .
All right , in any given dive , every single dive .
That &apos;s not conscious . And that &apos;s what we see today .
They &apos;re underwater , underwater , underwater , underwater .
It &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a place in the future , and the arrest of the archives .
And in this case , the female sees that the female will be more likely to be more likely .
So let &apos;s look at it again . Watch the web : the network , on the left .
I &apos;m a call coming back to the village .
I love to call it . I love the prostitution . This is a nicklier .
Watch them in touch . It makes it look like a little bit . It makes it look like a body .
This is the background .
This is the motion of motion . We learn a lot from summer water .
And it &apos;s kind of spoop . Isn &apos;t it amazing ? Now , Roger was the opposite .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Uh , it &apos;s been the same as a fish .
So we &apos;re not going to be the best possible thing when it &apos;s possible .
It makes it stop .
One . Two . Three .
In short , you know , Kim Hal &apos;s history is the history of the audience , but the audience &apos;s history about the audience &apos;s history .
Everything changed from the film .
And when you see the first icons of the first icons .
And I didn &apos;t get lost .
I now don &apos;t know if I went back .
Now , the dragonflies are the lights of the Sun .
There &apos;s a part of religion .
You know , as a photographer was a young girl .
I could be sent back to a remarkable picture .
And I want to ask the question for question .
Every single thing happened to know about something .
And I &apos;d like to give you the answer .
This is a police worker .
But many of us are held by the Chinese police police .
Now , I was very lucky , so lucky , I had a lot of Muslims , many of the Muslims were lucky .
And then a new language story could do with a new language , and after we did business .
We don &apos;t need to preserve the village in Germany .
Most of us had been protected , but after the 67 years of fragments , we had to be afraid of breaking .
If I don &apos;t have a village in the village , if you don &apos;t have a village Korean ?
So I started to figure out how to make them better .
I was in the right path to listen to the Himi Prize .
I &apos;m looking for China to deal with the Chinese .
And I got up to think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about thinking and think about
I was obsessed with my family .
But a short time later in Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake La
We were very lucky , but when I was asked , I had to take care of the prison in prison .
I don &apos;t know .
I had to tell you , in order to make sure that he was going to take it out .
I &apos;m an symbolic of my life life .
They start with very little poll in their lives .
I &apos;m sure that TED has not been a drum .
This is what we designed in 2009 .
We &apos;re looking at it in the landscape .
It &apos;s going to hit the ground before it comes in .
You know , you know , you know , kids love to brush .
This looks like this .
So , why is that ?
And he said to me , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be the Scientist . &quot;
But I said to him , &quot; &quot; Not possible . &quot; &quot; But he insisted : &quot; How do you assault the village ?
The dreams of the apartments . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; Now , the tattoid workers have to be amazing .
But we &apos;ve managed to take the idea of the idea of the trees .
Now , there are three brothers .
They &apos;ve made these bags , we call the milk .
But yeah , it &apos;s been used by other information .
They fall on the bag .
They have flown .
( Laughter ) Sometimes you go to the middle of a tree around the next year .
And what you see is that this boy loved this boy , which is what you see .
( Laughter ) Every time a year , they sit in the village .
This is very cute .
They don &apos;t read the ceiling .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s time-consuming .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s possible , because we want to see my kids aren &apos;t at the same time , but we want to see on top .
It &apos;s also going to see the ceiling , but you can see the ceiling .
And that &apos;s where you can see — there &apos;s all sorts of water clubs .
You see , you can see that you &apos;re going to take their friends in the middle of the middle pipes , and you can see that the neuron is normal .
But what you see is that you can take care of them with a boy who is like to fill them with water .
( Laughter ) There would be a lot of time in Baghdad .
There &apos;s no room outside and deserts .
And that means that the arctic arctic arctic arctic .
There are no windows there .
There are no acoustic headlines .
Most of the apartments start to survive in order to make sure .
But it doesn &apos;t matter if there &apos;s nothing wrong .
Because there &apos;s no trouble here .
Connectivity tells us that if you don &apos;t want to be in the middle of a gown , then there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
Connections will go back to the next one .
( Laughter ) What I &apos;m saying is that kids have to hide in their people .
And here they go back to innovation .
This is the process of process .
Secondly , we have a lot of promise to have the surface .
You know , kids are better at the sky .
They don &apos;t sleep .
And in our relationships , kids are compensated to the mosquito .
You know , we &apos;re in the middle of the southeast of the Bible .
I need them .
You can tell you , you know , you can talk to your friends with your friends .
You don &apos;t have to be transparent .
You know , we &apos;re going to go to everything else .
Now , here &apos;s OK .
And it turns out , in contrast to 20 or 20 , we can go to see .
Let &apos;s see if we &apos;re sorry .
I think we &apos;re going to be able to spend 50 .
We don &apos;t go .
We don &apos;t know .
So we &apos;ve got a lot to do .
We need to act with kids .
And they &apos;re trying to divide the signal .
And in fact , it &apos;s really important .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) This is a child in the middle .
That &apos;s the neuromouth .
This is one thing .
There &apos;s a good slide here .
There are a lot of networks .
It &apos;s trying to hold the fruit in the lower space .
( Laughter ) More fruit . ( Laughter )
Every time in the room , there &apos;s no interest in the room .
Santa Claus comes from .
And this is the kind of thing that &apos;s been built on the flat side of the room .
It has five meters , and it &apos;s seven center .
It &apos;s got a lot of aluminum .
We need to take care of people .
We &apos;ll give a little boy invention .
They try to get inside .
It &apos;s worth it .
It &apos;s good .
It &apos;s the power . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) It turns out that it &apos;s not enough to be taken from the palm tree .
And then we came up with other kids .
You know , Tokota has a lot .
( Laughter ) He &apos;s trying to learn how to drive .
You need to take care of the kids in a little bit , even though we have a little bit .
They learn to learn to help each other .
This is a city , and we give these benefits .
This is a letter from 9.10- to 9.10- to 9.-100-foot old boy .
It &apos;s 183 square miles .
Not so much .
It &apos;s crazy , and it &apos;s six of six feet .
But it &apos;s also true .
And in this bond , kids are looking at the middle account of the middle account of the middle account .
There are kids who are in the middle of the audience in the middle of the audience .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t take them back . &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t take them back .
( Laughter ) Let me tell you . ( Laughter )
I think I don &apos;t have to be able to raise the idea of what &apos;s going on , but they don &apos;t need to be able to grow up .
They need to get a vaccine .
Because it will teach them how to live in life .
And I think that coal is the same to change the world &apos;s lives .
This building is one of the names that kids have to change their lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
In the &apos; 70s , I &apos;ve been doing a holistic job in the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 30s .
In the first class , I &apos;ve been able to take care of the United States in the United States to be pessimistic school .
But my father said , &quot; &quot; Yox . &quot; &quot; They wanted me to be a Muslim .
And after the same time , I was a member of the United States , a good way to get a good deal .
I don &apos;t want to love my work .
But my desire was to be the Chinese opera .
This is the map of the signal .
We need to be doing a lot of work to be the object of the opera , and I have to go back to the opera when I could go to the opera school .
And then I wrote that in the school for the first time to prepare our students to make it work .
But I didn &apos;t tell my idea .
Nobody believes I &apos;m gay .
But my friends would like me to ask me , &quot; &quot; They have no power .
So , I understood that I was going to be successful in the tea .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s what I think .
And I had to tell you that I had a second dignist in the end of my life .
But it was unthinkable .
I decided to find another way else .
No matter what &apos;s going on , no matter what ?
I negotiate books .
So I had a book called &quot; &quot; Cheler by the family , &quot; &quot; which was written by the inventor in the book , &quot; &quot; Fou Lei . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But if I had a school , I took the model of the &quot; &quot; Fou Lei email . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I &apos;ve learned that when I had a school , I took the model of the book .
&#91; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The other name is Echo Chan . &quot; &quot; ( Video ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) I &apos;ve been photographing the first one in the U.S.
Of course , it &apos;s a book that &apos;s been named in Chinese .
&quot; &quot; BIranian Toraus , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right now .
There &apos;s no use for it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a fan .
The Bible is interesting , a little bit of strange .
( Laughter ) This is the other day today .
But I &apos;d like to wear my fifth birthday , and I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to take care of the family . &quot;
So I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Had it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s different from &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s different from &quot; &quot; Hunting . &quot; &quot; And in this way , I was lucky , I was able to take care of myself from my daily experience in Concussion .
I didn &apos;t want to talk to you about the new level of information .
That &apos;s a lot of things .
For example , in the first beginning of this map , it seemed strange to me , because we &apos;ve got this map of this map .
I didn &apos;t agree that the Chinese couldn &apos;t be in the center of the world .
In fact , the map of the map shows you .
It &apos;s not new .
This is a standard practice in my hand world .
In fact , there are a lot of people who have a lot of science and literature .
And in the middle of the story , it helps to help scholarship the opposite .
And I thought , why don &apos;t you really think about it , if it works to work with a principal store ?
So , I began to read books in some ways .
It turns out that the people who have been involved in the same event , &#91; Benjamin Franklin &quot; &quot; printer : &quot; &quot; John Adams . &quot; &quot; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Adams &quot; &quot; type : David McCullogh , and a little bit of the same as the sound of the same air .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Fanti Tlix &quot; &quot; printer : The Kathhan Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Larking : Warren Buffett and Life &quot; &quot; printer : Alice Schrows .
For example , it was the case , it was the political and the political and the soul .
It &apos;s interesting to be here in the Buddha , which is a psychiatrist : probability and sociology .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re reading books about two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Chug Theo &quot; &quot; printer : Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; TO : &quot; &quot; FTTO : &quot; &quot; FTTO : &quot; &quot; Fantastic . &quot; &quot; Not the name of the Amy Walts .
For example , I understood the courage to contract in China , in China , in China .
China is called &quot; &quot; new key . &quot; &quot; Yes .
( Laughter ) The books that I &apos;ve been able to talk about is playing the segregated role in which I &apos;ve been able to connect with people in time .
I know that I wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to get there .
Now , what you &apos;re not doing is the gift of other people &apos;s suffering .
And I started to believe that the desire is not to the imagination .
That &apos;s what we need to do with the idea that we need to make sure that we should not be able to make sure that there is something .
The desire is to do that .
It &apos;s what I &apos;m going to see on this day , and this is what I am doing , and I live in a lot of time .
And I say , &quot; &quot; Have you ever got books ? &quot;
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in office , and you &apos;re going to see the people that you &apos;re going to see in your room and your room .
It just takes place .
Don &apos;t give the information to the information .
Today , to work today .
You couldn &apos;t fertilize that .
And what I &apos;m going to do is watch the picture and ask your question : &quot; &quot; Why did my hometown ? &quot; &quot; Yage on the morning , and you &apos;re in your office .
( Laughter ) And this is a woman who &apos;s seen as a witness from the beginning .
This is what we &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; I wish I could go back to those two hours , as I want to go back to the starch . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day our job is , how good people have to do .
And I talk about something much more valuable than the office .
Over time , from your time .
In fact , I believe that this is the Ranzi Razi , which is why a new killer of a new disease .
( Laughter ) I think that the Ranzi Shelf of the Ranzi Shelf should be considered to be in the United States . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s a reflex reflex , a reflex reflex , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I have to make it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know , it &apos;s the case ?
Every company is the opening of the success of success .
And I really think it &apos;s a little bit of a conversation .
But in the last couple of years , a couple of years of cobalation in the last couple of years of cobalation .
We &apos;re hungry . ( Laughter ) And why don &apos;t you know that the man &apos;s man doesn &apos;t get good enough to pass a man &apos;s man &apos;s name , DRS , to think about it .
In fact , I have the column that DRA is global epidemist .
I &apos;m talking to you .
So a couple of years ago , I put a video on YouTube , every few years that you could have been able to achieve this video .
This is about five minutes of video that we &apos;ve talked about about five minutes of video .
This is the gravitational pull of the people who don &apos;t have to drive .
They don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
And it went on a woodwestern way .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s important .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s look at scale .
( Video ) Today , we need to have a tendency to make a very specific argument .
So , Sam , who was a girl ?
Slah , Joe-Man . I work today .
( Laughter ) Shake Joe . Joe .
I said , there &apos;s a lot of people who we want to take care of , which we want to take care of .
And as a group — ( Laughter ) — it &apos;s burg dong , who is ?
Yox ? Tell me what you &apos;re doing . ( Laughter )
It comes to me .
A couple of weeks after a couple of weeks , 500,000 people in the middle of a couple of countries , in fact , were actually looking for this video .
And then three years later , this video takes a little bit .
If you look at these numbers and millions of stars , we use the user .
To find interactive galaxies , I &apos;ve been able to find out the signal .
I think it &apos;s useful to find the truth that we can use .
I started with a 30-grade airline , and I started with a 30-grade airline .
( Laughter ) And only 72 years with middle account , the quarks , the quarks , the toys that are bright .
( Laughter )
It &apos;s the first time you &apos;re sleeping .
People don &apos;t know that there are people who don &apos;t know , but they don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s one of the most important expression .
It &apos;s not the whole thing that we don &apos;t have to do .
The final equation of the Swedish University of Sweden .
I don &apos;t feel smiley health care of people who don &apos;t smile .
You know , when you were hungry , they got a tapestry , and they got a tapestry in the mouths of the mouth .
In the book &quot; &quot; Jeopards &quot; &quot; in the book &quot; &quot; Jeopards , &quot; &quot; a theory of theory .
After the botanies of the boat , and then a handle on the boat .
This is the theory of science , and it makes people feel better , and it makes people feel better .
And it can be a process .
( Laughter )
The people who don &apos;t smile , and I &apos;m not smiling .
You don &apos;t have to be able to afford to be able to afford your own weight before you or not , but you don &apos;t have to go through the village .
I &apos;m Maykl Stratter , the director of the Caribbean , the director of the Caribbean .
We can call the paranoremal claims of paranorelities , marginalized , marginalized , marginalized , and my hands , my hands , my shirt , my shirt , my shirt , my shirt , my shirt , and it &apos;s not like that .
If you don &apos;t live in the last time , if you don &apos;t live in the Marsar , you get more like this .
Some of us call us a nickname .
But if you think about it , there &apos;s a lot of things .
We need to make the groundwork of the Police of the Police arise , and we &apos;re going to find them out , and we want to change the ideas with the good ideas .
Let me show you a little bit of a bad idea .
I &apos;ve made it . I &apos;ve made it .
It &apos;s a willingness company in Virginia .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Quatro 2000 . &quot;
( Laughter ) They sell it to 900 dollars in the schools .
Radio Shack antennas is a plastic thing built .
You &apos;re going to use a lot of devices to look at things from devices . But this is a triple point of view .
( Laughter ) So it works : if it &apos;s going to be in the hallway , if you go back to where it &apos;s going to be when it &apos;s going to be in the hallway .
Something .
I &apos;m going to show you .
( Laughter ) Ham . This is a little bit of fruit .
So let &apos;s try to try to try to get that back to our hands .
And it &apos;s going to go on this side .
( Laughter ) You had no matter whether you &apos;re not smart . ( Laughter )
Of course , that &apos;s the question : What is the marijuana in your mind ?
And this is the answer : you can get your jurisdiction to your dignity .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) We need to watch our tapestry , not our tapestry .
There &apos;s a little bit of the light that &apos;s going on here , which is — you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do : the numbers , the dragonflies and so forth .
People would tell their tapirs , they memorize tapirs .
We &apos;ve done everything in my hands . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re not aware of the number of tapirs and the Bible .
So we did this .
We took two quars , which I had to put together in one of the DHC , which is a painting that &apos;s been recorded .
And we have 50 percent of the results . ( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to take that generation .
This is what we &apos;ve invested in , and it &apos;s a little nickness .
&quot; &quot; Scientist , &quot; &quot; released from three months . It &apos;s always going to happen .
This is the future of the future .
People don &apos;t have a mouthful ?
And I have a new idea of what &apos;s going on in my work , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to see .
Every decade has the average IQ 3 .
Very interesting .
Don &apos;t think that if you don &apos;t think anything about you .
Have some of my hands and religion ?
This is what I think is to ask you to be an idiot .
These are two different things .
My hands is not matter , it &apos;s activity .
It &apos;s a question about what &apos;s happening .
All phenomena for phenomena are the way we &apos;re looking for .

Let &apos;s take more control , science and science , and we have a niece between the theory .
For example , there were two problems in Saturn , Saturn &apos;s telescope .
First , there was no theory about placing the rings .
Secondly , we had a scholar , and we had to deal with it . And it didn &apos;t matter .
And he &apos;d seen what he saw : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve had a lot of objects out there . &quot;
And he insisted that he did this .

Have you ever ? You don &apos;t know you guys .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re not going to matter to your brain , and we &apos;re going to listen to your brain .
( Music words ) It &apos;s kind of possible .
I &apos;m going to finish with a little story about a small , cute story .

We don &apos;t have 12 billion people , 13.7 billion light years , and that doesn &apos;t laugh .
Sometimes it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be a small news .
So , if not just right , we can tell you that it &apos;s very good .
Now , the story is that after the summer of the summer , the author of the summer came to him . He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
I was selling it . He wrote his head .
And I end up with it .
( Music words ) We have 33,7 billion light lights that we can see in the history of the universe .
There may be a story in the middle , but that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
And the data that we have to do with the data , I think , is that I &apos;m going to be one of them .
( Laughter ) Not just ?
( Applause )
In the &apos; 60s , in the mid-1980s , when you &apos;re in a communist in Germans , you need to pass it out of it .
The machine had to pass through a piece of media .
But it could be the opposite of all the text .
Now , in a paper , when he thought about a paper that he had to think about , they could take the author of this idea .
And we &apos;ve been able to do this in the same way that we &apos;re going to have a big deal in the language that we &apos;ve been doing in the Bible .
We couldn &apos;t even invent in our economy .
But this day in the year 201-7-7-th , you can play a laser player , and you can play a laser , which is a laser , which is a laser , and you can play a laser , which is that you can play a laser , which is that you can play a laser in the first place , which is a laser .
This is what we are today .
Nobody has to do that .
This is what we need to eradicate ourselves from the technology of the technology .
This problem is one of these three main factors .
And even if you could have a theory of questions , we &apos;ll see the onset of people who can &apos;t tell the story .
These milestones are divided into three major people .
First , they are homulars .
This is the Dimitri Gatbov in this picture of the Ukrainian city .
And it &apos;s not hard to understand what &apos;s going on in the homage of homosexuality .
These guys have poll .
They &apos;re very , very , very , very much more likely to get more money .
In fact , we &apos;ve seen people who have a million people who are injured .
This is Vivasis Thastu from Estonia .
This is Alfred Gonzley .
This is Stephen West .
This is Bown Suntin .
This is Matthew Anderson , and the history of Historics is the Al-Dauuri .
These are men who are honored their strings , but they &apos;re doing this kind of ethanol , which we have to do as well , as we &apos;ve been able to take care of our funding calculations , which we have to do as well , in order to take care of what we &apos;ve had to do with our capacity to do , to take care of our credentials .
In the United States , the United States had been released two months ago called Sam Jin , who was in the United States , who had 13.9 million U.S. U.S. dollars in the U.S.
And it doesn &apos;t even know that the Samm Jews is hale .
And I think we should not be able to do this in the same way that we should not be the equals of the real world .
And it seems to be clear that it &apos;s going to be alive .
In the future , we &apos;re going to deal with the number of genes .
The second largest group of humanoids that have to do with this is not the case .
And the reason that we see them is that we can see them , the idea that we need to see them .
Anonymous , like Anonymous , who started to take place in the last year , started to take responsibility .
Three of the three main questions : these are the kinds of things that we have to do for money , like Anonymous , who are the ones who have to do this for money . The third key is , and then the third is , and then , the third key is that they are .
And we have to deal with the deal with our companies like Digimular .
This is the obvious aspect of what I &apos;m trying to humanize .
This is a certificate in the Diego Hospital — in fact — it &apos;s more .
We didn &apos;t get the first one in the next year .
It took the whole system into systems .
And I asked him , &quot; &quot; This is the Holocaust hunch , &quot; &quot; and I asked him , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you believe that the people that go to the Nethernesian halls are the people who are going to collapse ? &quot;
He said .
What happens to people like that ?
This is the University of Diego .
They sell it for performance .
What do they do with certifications ?
And if you want to use it , if you want to use it , if you want to use it , you need to use this certification service if you want to use it to use it .
We &apos;re using a lot of ethics , and we &apos;re using a lot of governments to read , like the Iranians , the Iranians , the Iranian regime in these countries , because they &apos;re more likely to use a lot more than the same as the same as SSL passwords , because the SSL passwords are much more likely to take place in the world .
But this is what &apos;s going on , this kind of effect , the implications of the moral performance .
It &apos;s possible to spread the surface of the landscape .
That &apos;s what happened to me .
So , what do you deal with ?
In Maialem , 2011 , 2011 , the Misalous police officer Misalers had taken the center of the secret police .
In between these sheets , &quot; &quot; FINFFISHER . &quot; &quot; And in this case , the Germans have been the same as the Germans in Germany , and in the United States , in the United States , the company Miss Misir had a lot to do with all sorts of things , and the program Misir Misir would sell to all sorts of things .
They sold these tools for the Misir hunch .
The center of the company can put the center here .
In the sliver , the governments have the same devices that allow governments to make their own citizens under their own body .
But governments do this in their own business .
For example , a few weeks ago , a few weeks ago , they called &quot; &quot; The Germans , &quot; &quot; which was created by the Germans , and this geeks were designed by the Germans of the Germans .
If you were to have Hansen , you have to have the same thing that if you &apos;re in your phone .
Now , here is the increase in that .
They &apos;re going to follow the Internet .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can tell your password to your audience .
And so many of the people who are consulting the rules like this : &quot; &quot; Exactly , no good job , no good work , I don &apos;t have a lot to tell me .
Why am I ?
There &apos;s nothing wrong . &quot; &quot; But that &apos;s a very isolation .
It &apos;s the magic .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This is not the security in the future , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
It depends on what &apos;s going on .
And if we believe that in this day , we believe that in the past , we believe that we believe it in the world , and what we do is we are .
But if we don &apos;t get the next 50 years , you can &apos;t get the 50 years to the other ?
And if you don &apos;t want to take care of it in 50 years , the water has to go .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you .
I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; Because I was 17 years .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said ,
My family , and my friends , and my friends , they &apos;ve got the Army to listen .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here to tell you that you &apos;re here , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m grateful for you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . &quot;
( Laughter ) Have you ever taken the 17 years in the middle of you and your mother &apos;s life .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; This is a joint , &quot; &quot; — I can handle it .
I looked at my journey , because I couldn &apos;t understand the sky .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know my voice in 17 years , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; My God , what &apos;s my thinking ? &quot;
And then I realized that I was sorry , and I was smiling .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s too important to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s too important . &quot;
This is what we &apos;re looking at in the extraordinary world of this journey .
And I think about the metaphor for our journey , and I want you to think about what you think about .
I was in my journey from 1979 to the first time that the Golden Gate of two neotarians have been in the Golden Gate of two neocortex , then a half millimeter of GDP .
I insist that I decided to use it to use the tools in the literature .
This is a huge thing for California .
This little Point Reayas was something that I lived in Individual Tayas , which is a great thing for the small Point , 350 grandmothers who lived there .
And I came back in the middle of the middle , and I came back in the middle , people — what they did .
They said to me , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; John , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure you &apos;re going to take care of us . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; You do it to make us embarrassing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you feel that if you &apos;re willing to make it worse ? &quot; &quot; And maybe they were right now , and people who were willing to join me in a million people .
Because , in my pocket , what we &apos;re looking for is because of what &apos;s going on .
And when I talk about it , I had a tendency to talk to people who are engaged .
I didn &apos;t tell you .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t use it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Why don &apos;t you use it to do that ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t know about it .
They lived in Philadelphia .
I said to my mother — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad to say anything . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t need to say anything . &quot;
So I decided to make a 27-7-77-77-7-75-year-old — I insist that I &apos;m not going to talk about a daily basis , but a daily basis .
So , I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did this — so I did
I didn &apos;t talk about a village .
And I think that this was a wonderful experience for me , because I started to listen to that for the first time .
And I had to think about what I did .
Because I &apos;ve always been able to listen to people , and when I listen to people , I don &apos;t listen to them , and when I listen to people , I don &apos;t listen to them .
And I would like to tell you , and I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you , and I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to tell you .
And then ...
And so that we ate a community of food .
And that day , I was really listening .
And that was my father because I had to learn about something in the world .
I had 27 years old , and I thought , I know everything .
But I didn &apos;t know .
So , for the next day , I &apos;ve talked about it , and then we &apos;ve got to go back to the next time . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell myself , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take care of it . &quot; &quot; I started to learn about it , and I needed it .
So , I didn &apos;t talk about a year , and then I thought , maybe I started to talk about some of the things I &apos;ve learned .
But it took 17 years .
I came back in the middle of this 17 years , and I went to the bathroom , and I had to learn about my career , and I had to learn to learn from my wife .
And I think I need to get education .
I went to Oregnon , I went to Oregnon , and there was a retractable .
800 kilometers in the middle range .
I went to the middle office office , and what ?
I &apos;ve shown that in my thesis , I &apos;ve shown that I &apos;ve been able to show the past .
Ah , you want to read here in the east ?
What ?
We have a remarkable program .
And after two years , I ended up looking at speeches .
It came back . He was doing it .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , my son , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do with you , but we don &apos;t know what to do with it .
You don &apos;t take care of them , if you don &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I grew up , and I came back from innovation and innovation .
Port Toward , I came to Washington , I came to Washington , and I went from the tree to Washington , from Idaho to Washington , Washington , Montana .
I went to the Montana University of Montana , and I said , &quot; I &apos;ve talked about two years ago .
Not only two years here .
( Laughter ) And it happened . I had two years in University of University , and the Army had to tell me so much .
In Montana , there are two stories .
The first is that we came to land in the forest .
And they said , &quot; &quot; This is the director of the program , &quot; &quot; the director of the program called &quot; &quot; Shabah innovation , &quot; &quot; and he said to me , &quot; &quot; Furthermore . &quot;
When you go to America , hutter ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Cayos and lasts , the hydics , the village .
So I did this .
He came back to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , John , John , you can take the angle of a book , you can take the opening of a book , you can use it from a book .
Now , I &apos;m sure that we can make sure that we could do it from all professionals .
You know , you know , you know , you know , if you want to take care of the data , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re on the floor .
It was big to help me to help me .
And what I &apos;d like to do is try to see that my life was a lot , and they tried to help me to help me .
And in this tattoo , I used to be able to talk back to me .
At the first time , I was 13 years old .
And I had to tell them about my friends , my friends , my friends , who said , &quot; &quot; My name is John Francis , I &apos;ve told them , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go anymore .
What &apos;s happening in the future ?
( Laughter ) I would have had a time when I was able to go out and grab it .
But I had to tell you that I had to call it .
After two weeks , he &apos;d been trying to go into our fly .
So I &apos;ve learned a lot about this pattern — that &apos;s what we do .
He would tell me — I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know — I don &apos;t know , I think it &apos;s the village of the tree of the tree .
Yox , no . That &apos;s not — this is a user user .
It &apos;s the best one .
You can see if you &apos;re there .
Yox , he talks about that choice .
So , it was a nerd , and we did it .
I took it back to this work and say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve moved away .
But what I &apos;ve learned is something I &apos;ve learned . &quot; &quot; And when I show you a job , they made sure that I didn &apos;t have any meaning in theory that I didn &apos;t have to do .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t tell you , if you &apos;re a teacher , and if you don &apos;t tell yourself , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t tell you if you don &apos;t learn anything .
So , I danced .
I had to put it in the field , and he said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t take care of it . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t take care of it . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to drive .
What do you think to do with a Magicime degree ? &quot; &quot; I went to college , and I went to University University .
I &apos;d like to have a couple of years to write about what &apos;s going on .
Heots of people would not be curious .
But something happened — Exxon Valdez .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a man who writes about what I &apos;ve written about in the U.S.
And it came back .
He said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know what this is , &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t know , you don &apos;t know what this happened .
And my father said , &quot; &quot; You need to put your cheese , because you &apos;re going to get better jobs . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So I got my tea with innovation .
I went back to the Atlantic Ocean , and I went to the Atlantic Ocean , and I got my feet to the Atlantic Ocean , seven years and a day .
And in 1997 , I started to talk about the 20th century of the Sun .
And I &apos;ve been working on that , because when there is no man in the middle of the room , there &apos;s no man on the same time when there &apos;s no man on the floor .
And I thank you , and I thank you , because I had to thank you , and I thank you .
And this is the celebration .
And they &apos;ve taught me to listen to me — they listened to me .
And that &apos;s something that I had to listen to .
There are really many — we need to listen to each other .
I was my journey .
He said , &quot; &quot; This is a joint . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t get this .
I &apos;ve been working on my fieldship , and I &apos;ve been doing the University of BMT-Sunni .
I &apos;m writing for the United States for the United States — what &apos;s going on for the U.S.
If someone asked me , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you want to do ? &quot; &quot; And what do you want to do ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , I want to do differently . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You can go back to the middle of the middle of the courtroom . &quot; &quot; And then they said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , I &apos;m going to go through the sky . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you want to be different . &quot;
What is that ? What ?
How do you get to get different from what &apos;s going on in the market ?
It has been a wonderful shot of the way that we had to have a conversation .
And then — I went to the next year — I said , &quot; &quot; This is a year I &apos;m going to see another year . &quot; &quot; And I went to the next year , and I went to Caracas , and I went to the United States .
And it turns out that I need to tell you why I started to talk to you .
I started to talk about my class , and I started to talk about it .
I &apos;ve learned that in the middle of this planet , I &apos;ve learned about the formula , but it &apos;s also a remarkable model .
And I had to learn about a remarkable surface — and I had to learn about what I learned about people .
And it &apos;s not because of the trees and birds and the birds , but not only in the educational landscape , and it &apos;s not just to look at all of us .
And if we don &apos;t do it , we can look around and see our behavior , and we can see each other &apos;s behavior .
And that was the name I wanted to make .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I have to go through this kind of theory , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have to put it in other words . &quot; &quot; And I was like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got my own life , and I &apos;ve done it . &quot; &quot; And I came back to the Venice .
This story is the result of that story , and I realized that I didn &apos;t have to use it .
I went around to the El Dorado — who was known as a prison , and a brick prison , and I didn &apos;t know what it was — Venice , and I didn &apos;t .
He said to me , &quot; &quot; Phasaitate , &quot; &quot; he said to me , &quot; &quot; Phasaitate , Phasaitte , &quot; &quot; and the M16-5th anniversary .
I said , &quot; &quot; Passport ?
I &apos;m not in the middle of the show , I &apos;m not in the kitchen .
I &apos;m BMT Scientist — a doctor Francis , and I went around .
What did he say ?
And it came back to the future .
They didn &apos;t laugh .
I &apos;m going to go down and see what I &apos;m going to say , thank God I &apos;m going to die ?
And after 150 miles , I realized that I had been surrounded by a product , and I was surrounded by a product .
I was in prison , and I had to go out there .
But I didn &apos;t have to use the community in the middle of Africa .
What happens ?
Because when I started to use it , it would be like if you could use it to use it .
But the difference is that I &apos;ve always wanted to take care of myself , I don &apos;t want to take care of my feet from my feet .
I &apos;m not going to be the BMT Scientist .
I &apos;m not going to be a professor .
And so I realized that I had another responsibility to change , and I had to change it .
You know , we can do it .
I was able to change the way I change .
And I had to change , because I &apos;ve always been told that I was always going to be moving .
Because I had to tell you that she didn &apos;t want the end .
I didn &apos;t know who I was .
But I could do it .
I could change it , because I &apos;m not here today .
And I know that we &apos;ve got to find ourselves in a place that we really want to take care of ourselves .
And we already have to put ourselves in an arena , which we already had to have new identity , and we already have a new identity .
And what I &apos;d like to do is take you into the next panel , and I want to take you back to where you &apos;re going to take care of them , and that &apos;s the way that you can go out of the prison , which is that we need to do something .
We now need to change .
We need to be able to act as much as we call Vitor Pretain .
And if my voice comes to you , if my voice says , &quot; &quot; If I want to tell you , if I &apos;ve ever experienced it .
I know , when I &apos;m here you &apos;re here , you can take some of you .
So , let &apos;s take this back to the world , and this is the world that we &apos;ve been able to take care of this , which is that we &apos;ve been able to put this thing in the world that we &apos;re going to share with each other , and we &apos;ve been able to put it in the world .
Because what we &apos;re seeing is our behavior , and our behavioral behavior is our behavior .
So I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m here to finish up with these five seconds , and I &apos;m going to finish here with five seconds .
Thank you . Thank you .

It turns out that in the United States , if you &apos;re in the United States , you zoom on on a chip , and I ask , &quot; Get it , this block is called ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; This is the Oak of Oak .
This is 26-digit . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Good , good , what is this block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; You know , we don &apos;t have blocks . &quot;
There are issues , the blocks of blocks , not just for the gravitational end of the spectrum , &quot; &quot; he called a little bit of hair .
Now , if you &apos;re in the future , if you &apos;re in the middle of the world , you &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; &quot; You cook , this is what &apos;s called ? &quot;
He says , &quot; &quot; This is a block of 17th , and that block is 16th , &quot; &quot; and you say , &quot; &quot; This is what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; CThree ? &quot;
They have names .
Google Mission . Here &apos;s 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , high-line blocks .
All of these blocks are the names of these blocks . The triangles are called the &quot; &quot; haupers . &quot;
And you &apos;re saying , &quot; &quot; How do you do ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Well , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
And this is what you &apos;re going to say to 17 and a house , &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; If you ask , &quot; &quot; When you ask , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t get home . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t get home . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s a lot of clubs .
The first one is the first of the first home of the first home .
And then the second is 2,2- .
This is an archaic . It &apos;s an artist , and it &apos;s light . &quot; &quot; Now , I love it to see that we don &apos;t even think about what we &apos;re going to do to see if we don &apos;t really think about what we &apos;re going to do to see if we don &apos;t think about it .
For example , who &apos;s in Chinese who are in Chinese who are in the Chinese need to make you robust .
You &apos;ve got people who are right , and if you &apos;re sick , and if you &apos;re sick , if you &apos;re sick , you don &apos;t get any money , because they don &apos;t have to come out of their own business . &quot; &quot; They &apos;re always going to be when you &apos;re strong when you &apos;re weak .
( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) So we &apos;ve got a &quot; &quot; one . &quot; &quot; And one , two , three , four .
But in the West Africa , &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a piece of music , &quot; &quot; which is the end of a sentence , is the end of a sentence .
So , just as you see it , it &apos;s not just about the limitations , but there &apos;s two , three , four , four .
And that map is true .
But there is a statement that you know about India , what you know , what you know about India .
So , if you don &apos;t forget about how ideologically , you know , you know , you don &apos;t forget about what &apos;s going on in other places , and if you don &apos;t do anything .
Tomo is the brownut . ( Applause ) Okay .
