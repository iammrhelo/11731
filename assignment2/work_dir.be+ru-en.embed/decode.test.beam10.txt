And yet , the end of this year is going to be about a <unk> person who is using a lot of <unk> .
They had to tell them about what they &apos;re going to do .
Now , this is a false thought , but I think it &apos;s in a serious way that I think I &apos;m going to do .
I thought about it and I thought about it , and I thought about it in a way that the cancer was in the hospital .
Her family had his family and friends write to write a post to her death .
That &apos;s what he said in the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s my death . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s my last job .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be wondering how only my body would get rid of the breast cancer , my family , my family , and my friends , and my friends , who would have been able to be able to be better , and more likely to be able to be better , and more importantly , the answer is that today , <unk> <unk> could be better , and more importantly , the answer is that today , we all have to be better than anything that was going on .
<unk> a little <unk> .
Take 48 hours of YouTube videos .
It &apos;s about 200 million hectares .
<unk> <unk> generates 90 <unk> per month .
When you look at your parents , if you &apos;re talking about your parents , you know , they &apos;ve created a few <unk> , or they take a video of a video , or a piece of a video , or a person who &apos;s going to get into the <unk> .
But today , we &apos;re going to be an incredibly good idea of the <unk> , which is going to live in the world as much time for our death .
And I think that this creates an incredibly powerful opportunity to serve .
For example , I &apos;m going to be angry , and I &apos;m not going to do it , because I &apos;d like to give you a sense of what we &apos;re going to do with what &apos;s going on and the future of the future .
We see some of the things that allow us to be able to figure out that we are going to be able to figure out that we are going to be able to deal with ourselves .
And one of them would be able to be able to find me in a way that I found that I had found that I was going to be able to put myself on a pedestal in the morning .
( Laughter ) Adam : <unk> .
TBP : Adam ?
And so .
<unk> : <unk> can take you anywhere in any hour , even in the same hour .
And the question is : Who is this ?
<unk> : <unk> on <unk> .
( Laughter ) And this is : <unk> , or not right ?
It makes a very simple thing to do , and it makes it easy to create a message or a video that can be written on Facebook after your time .
Number two , I &apos;m going to have 1,000 steps .
And it &apos;s going to allow the online to look at the Internet , and it &apos;s a video of the video , and it &apos;s a video of the video , and it &apos;s a video that they can do with your own .
But the next thing is that we &apos;re going to do it .
Many of you may have heard of <unk> Roy , which is in a <unk> way , as he had to do more than <unk> hours of video videos .
I think , with the ability to be able to understand the ability to understand the human language , and to be able to figure out whether it &apos;s going to be possible , it &apos;s going to be possible for the rest of your life , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , <unk> , a video , a video that we &apos;re going to do with a <unk> <unk> .
And I think , as soon as it is , for our own <unk> , it &apos;s going to be possible for us to be able to serve ourselves in a way that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to deal with our own , because we &apos;re going to be able to deal with the technology that we &apos;ve created , and the technology is going to make that meaning .
We &apos;re going to take a couple of <unk> .
There &apos;s such a <unk> — my <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> all your own records in front of me , everything you &apos;re going to do , and it makes sure you can write the next .
So , as you can see , it can be a <unk> device .
Imagine how to look at five or 10 or 20 years old or 20 years old , with a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s going to take a look at the test , and it &apos;s going to be able to figure out how people are .
And if you could be able to be able to be able to look at the <unk> <unk> , the hundreds of thousands of people who have been created for a whole bunch of <unk> , which is a common life .
<unk> , <unk> shots in the United States in 2008 when I was in the United States in 2008 , when I was to <unk> CNN in the U.S.
And what if we could use this technology for the <unk> of our <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that they created , as a rabbi ?
I mean , I think it &apos;s all possible that it &apos;s going to be a little bit more , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a data for them , and that &apos;s the ability for them to serve them .
So , as a result , I think we &apos;re all going to think of it , or we &apos;re going to be wondering , and if that &apos;s what it is going to be ? And if that &apos;s what is going to be true for your life and what it is .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You know , you &apos;ve heard that you &apos;ve heard the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
First of all , the first <unk> is the <unk> .
The other thing is that it &apos;s going to be dead .
We really understand more about the harshness of the reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer these questions .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
So this is what you want to understand .
And then you can do that , you know , they &apos;re going to do it .
that we have to do with the <unk> of the Universe .
And so these systems are <unk> , and it &apos;s called <unk> , <unk> fish , <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s interesting is that these systems are <unk> <unk> .
What are we going to do about this ?
It &apos;s kind of <unk> , even though it &apos;s a <unk> behavior .
And to try to understand the system , and to try to understand the system , and to try to understand the system that we want to do .
So on this system .
<unk> , literally , doesn &apos;t have a system from its own parts .
It &apos;s in the almond orchards .
But why not ?
Where is the infrastructure ?
We &apos;re going to look at <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
You may have noticed that no one has ever seen before .
&quot; How do they do it ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Are they angry ? &quot;
Or , <unk> , <unk> .
This is a company that &apos;s working on more than one degree , and there &apos;s 23,000 .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of all of them .
They &apos;re in the middle of the structure .
But what they &apos;re going to do is 95 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the answer to the question about who is going to be ?
You can do other things that you need .
<unk> through <unk> .
So one of the things that &apos;s going on is it &apos;s going to go through a <unk> net net .
And these are the main principles of the U.K.
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So I want to tell you , I want to worry about what &apos;s going on in the way that I &apos;m talking about .
In fact , if we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I imagine this , you can see the stage , and you see the stage , and you see the whole thing as a person , and he &apos;s going to be able to do it , and he &apos;s going to be able to do it in a way .
And I mean , it &apos;s like that , because it &apos;s not the <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s happening with us without our own .
I &apos;ve also been inspired by the English language , which means that I &apos;m talking about the words I &apos;m going to do .
You can say , and I &apos;d like to argue that there is a lot of things that we &apos;re going to be able to do , and that &apos;s perhaps a big part of them — there &apos;s a problem .
So , love , we &apos;re going to panic .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
<unk> makes us crazy , and it makes us tick .
<unk> hearts and then <unk> .
So what we &apos;re going to do is , of course , for somebody who &apos;s going to be married to sexual violence or not .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
And they take us as a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you look at the value of this word in <unk> — ( Laughter ) and if you look at the value of this word in <unk> — ( Laughter ) — you know , it means that it means that it means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot;
Only at the same time , there &apos;s 16 <unk> <unk> on the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; that &apos;s in favor of God .
( Laughter ) We have the same words to look for love in love , which is <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> ?
So how did this happen ?
How are we going to be able to do the same thing with <unk> <unk> and <unk> ?
And why are we talking about this as a kind of good experience , how would we do it ?
It &apos;s a hard question , but I have a few <unk> .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with that , I want to look at one of the <unk> <unk> that I &apos;m going to love as crazy .
When I first started studying the love of love , I was going to put these crazy things together .
Now , the story of the story of the <unk> culture , which is the ultimate love of kindness .
Here &apos;s a few examples .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> is just a crazy thing to do , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) There &apos;s always a lone nut .
I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> on me , I &apos;m going to get rid of it , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
I grew up in 20 years old , and this was a long way to do things from early days .
It was a lot of relationships for the last few years , because for me , it was a very high school , and it was a very high school .
I remember one moment .
I &apos;m going to go on a spoon in the <unk> in the Gulf of America , and I &apos;m going to be amazed at my door .
It was a <unk> , and it was almost a <unk> , and we looked at our bedroom , and if we went into our bedroom , he was doing things in the <unk> and <unk> .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t remember that I &apos;m going to look at this <unk> , and I &apos;m pretty sure that I remember it .
I was 22 , it was my first mother , and it was the first thing I was looking at .
I knew I was going to go home , and I knew the name of the city in which I knew the name of the city , and the name of the city in which I had to be able to be able to be able to do it , but I didn &apos;t have a clue like this .
I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , and I had no idea , and I didn &apos;t know it .
I had a little more <unk> for me , and I could do it as a moment , but I &apos;m going to panic .
I &apos;m just going to get there .
And then <unk> .
But no matter what it is , a small voice of my head in my head thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It was repealed .
I mean , I &apos;m really going to do this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because of course , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I &apos;m going to get the experience of myself in a way .
Now , this is pretty good for me , but at the age of 22 , I was going to have a <unk> <unk> , and at that moment , I was going to be quiet , and I thought this was just a little bit of me , but I thought this was just a little bit of me , but I thought this was a little bit of me , and I thought this was a little bit of me , and I thought this was a little bit of me , and I thought this was
I think , at the level of the level , I &apos;m going to be able to be <unk> <unk> , because I thought it was so love and it works .
It doesn &apos;t really need to be <unk> , and it &apos;s going to appreciate that there was eight <unk> , 14 songs , two <unk> and one of them , and one of the things that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> Love . &quot; &quot; She sat in front of his room .
We <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
But I &apos;m going to give someone to someone like mine , and it wasn &apos;t very good for me , and it wasn &apos;t very good for me or for him .
But I think that this kind of works is not very specific .
Most of us had to put themselves on a pedestal called <unk> <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a very good thing to do , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to do , because it &apos;s kind of <unk> , and it &apos;s not very easy for it .
That &apos;s really true .
It &apos;s about 1999 , 1999 , <unk> <unk> , so that the death rate is very similar to the people in the world with the <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , you know , it &apos;s also going to be connected to the end of the <unk> , and it &apos;s also going to be connected .
So there &apos;s a couple of things that love that love to do with our own <unk> and <unk> .
And the other thing that you know is , you know , most of the things that most people have learned to do is .
<unk> <unk> , which is the highest quality of the story of the teacher &apos;s experience on behalf of the <unk> , which seems to be a sense of feeling like someone else in your head .
And the majority of us , you know , when the first thing is .
A few months for a few months .
When I came out of my tour in my tour , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom .
I thought , if my friends don &apos;t know how to understand the mountain , I &apos;m going to put them together .
And so I &apos;m going to get rid of them with me .
And that was probably the same year in my life .
But I think I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be honest — that &apos;s my job , because if I was a teenager , then I &apos;m going to focus on how hard I am .
And if I &apos;m going to do that , then we would end up at the end of all of us together .
It &apos;s kind of a crazy thing to do , because there &apos;s no legal rule , it &apos;s not there , that &apos;s what a big deal is , but we &apos;re talking about love , as if it is true .
Our experiences and our experiences , and our experiences .
Our voice says that love is good , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s good , you know , it &apos;s good , you know , it &apos;s a good thing to do , when you look at it , and then she says , &quot; &quot; Well , love is going to be good .
In fact , you &apos;ve probably heard about this — you know , you &apos;ve heard about it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to hear about it .
( Laughter ) And then our culture is shared with our own , and it &apos;s going to be good for it .
In this case , we &apos;re talking about <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s crazy .
It &apos;s a very interesting thing to do .
And we &apos;re going to focus on the <unk> and the clock , and we &apos;re going to bring it through our words and the story , but then our minds and the story of us , and we &apos;re talking about the stories that we &apos;re talking about .
What &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s all happening in a culture that is <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to look at the wrong way , and we &apos;re crazy , and we want it to do it .
It &apos;s loud .
( Laughter ) To this extent , we need to change our culture , or change our culture .
Imagine that we &apos;ve all been less stressed out .
If we were more <unk> , more likely to be solved , more likely to be solved , and then instead of looking at it in love , we &apos;re going to do it .
I know that it requires a lot , but I &apos;m not the first person to do this .
In the book , we live in a book called Marc <unk> and George <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re kind of <unk> , and it &apos;s even more likely to be able to do that , and it &apos;s even more likely to do that .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m pretty good at this sort of thing .
The answer is , you know , you know , you know , you know , there &apos;s a way to do that , and there &apos;s a way to do that , and there &apos;s a way to distinguish all of them , or the ideas that go in .
And they tell them , and they tell me what they &apos;re talking about , and they say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And these ideas are good at the same time , and it &apos;s a good thing to do with that , but they &apos;re also working on the other side , and they also work on the other way , and they don &apos;t work , and they don &apos;t work , because these are fraudulent offenders are much more likely to sum up on the experience of someone &apos;s experience .
So , as love as love is , it &apos;s the ultimate <unk> of art , which is a dream experience .
<unk> <unk> , love <unk> , heart needs , love and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the love of love is with <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every single experience , every experience .
When I was an outsider , it never wasn &apos;t going to be a good thing , that it wasn &apos;t just loving love .
When you look at the first time , if you don &apos;t know , if you weren &apos;t going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be unable to be able to do anything , and she was missing four days ago .
Where is it ?
It &apos;s going to be exhausting .
Right ?
And as a result , at this point , this is a moment called &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is not the <unk> .
He <unk> , he <unk> , it &apos;s just a little bit of it .
I understand that I &apos;m going to understand that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when I read this <unk> , it was also about 14 years old , and I had the meaning for me .
I mean , love love as something that I &apos;m talking about , not what I &apos;m going to do with me , not what happens to me , not what happens to me , but I &apos;m not going to be able to do that , but I don &apos;t know what happens to me .
But it &apos;s still hard .
Now , when I was concerned about all the things that I &apos;m interested in , and when I feel like myself , I have to ask myself , my challenge to my partners about my partners on my partners about what I want to do with my partners .
It &apos;s also <unk> .
But that &apos;s a lot better than a second <unk> , which is a lone nut .
This is the number of things that you don &apos;t have to do on a <unk> or a loan .
Instead , they need to be able to do this , and they need to be able to do it , and they need to be able to deal with it , which is really hard , but , in fact , it &apos;s not easy , but , in fact , it &apos;s going to be very simple , but , in fact , it &apos;s going to be very simple .
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and whether you &apos;re going to be willing to think about yourself and to start thinking about how you &apos;re going to do it .
So this is the number of things that we can &apos;t say things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we are not very good <unk> . It &apos;s not for us .
Or , &quot; &quot; These are the things that were going to be <unk> than I am , but it was really great . &quot; &quot; Now , this was great .
So this is the first version of how we &apos;re going to look .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to be able to jump in a way that I was born with a little bit of a car , from a city called <unk> , which is in the <unk> , which is in the <unk> , which is in <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be if you &apos;re going to be dead , and you &apos;re not going to go on a <unk> , a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) Three miles away , and I &apos;m going to tell you about what I &apos;ve been talking about , and I wondered what I &apos;ve been talking about .
&quot; What is it that &apos;s going to be there ? &quot;
Her eyes on his forehead .
So you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to go , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to get a couple more <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to get a little bit of <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to panic because she understands .
That &apos;s me .
( Laughter ) Here he is , this <unk> <unk> site . ( Laughter )
Now , in the last five years , I &apos;ve been looking at a lot about this , and this is exactly why we &apos;re sometimes thinking about the dangers of us , and how we &apos;re going to be surprised if we &apos;re going to be able to do that , and that we &apos;re going to look forward to the human beings .
Now , I &apos;ve been studying the last five years in the morning of the Nigerian state .
I have a choice of a career in a way that you can imagine , but it &apos;s a huge <unk> competition for a <unk> room .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us would be able to get rid of ourselves , from the point of mind , if we don &apos;t want to think about what &apos;s going on , if you don &apos;t think about it .
We understand that .
We realize that the clock is in this room .
We are people , we &apos;re going to be angry . Excellent .
But if on the right side of me , at this moment , I &apos;ve got all this time in this time , and I &apos;ve got all of the things that I &apos;ve done in this particular time , and I &apos;m going to see that I can &apos;t even imagine that I &apos;m going to think that it is .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this unprecedented period of time .
So we &apos;ve got to go on a pedestal , and they have the same thing on the table , and they have the same thing to do with their voice .
We &apos;re all going to realize that we all live through the lives of belief that we &apos;re always right .
That &apos;s me the challenge .
And in my view , it &apos;s a problem , and every one of us , on a personal or a personal level , is that we all have a society .
What I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to talk today — this is a <unk> because we &apos;re going to have a <unk> .
Secondly , this is why it &apos;s going to be an approach .
And what I want you to do is I want you to stand up with the idea that I &apos;m going to stand with you , and when you do that , it &apos;s the best of all sorts of things that we have , and that &apos;s the best of all sorts of things that you can do .
So what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to focus on your own <unk> ?
And one of the things that happened is that I &apos;m going to have a piece of <unk> with a <unk> .
You can <unk> you , you know , because you &apos;re going to be here , you know , you &apos;re going to be here .
<unk> .
<unk> . Excellent . Excellent .
<unk> , from <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to give them to the other question .
You look at the question , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the sense of the belief that you &apos;re not supposed to be . &quot;
( Laughter ) So , you know , <unk> <unk> , how do you experience it , and yet a whole bunch of things , not ?
For example , it might be a sense of emotion , or a sense of awkwardness , or even though , as I &apos;ve got to do with my own <unk> <unk> .
But the truth is , it &apos;s not very dramatic <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
In fact , you know that in every single one of the things that &apos;s going to be , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
But every time you hit a rock with the rocks right now for a second .
And what happens is that it &apos;s only six years old , especially if you &apos;re only six years old .
It &apos;s just continuing to make sure that we don &apos;t pay attention to the dangers and they don &apos;t want to do it .
So that &apos;s what it is .
And if we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , but we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going to be wrong , and then we &apos;re going to get the wrong thing , and then we &apos;re going to get a rock .
<unk> , we &apos;ve been invited , we &apos;ve got to do that , but we still feel confident about the ground .
I &apos;ve got to give you a sense of what I said .
There is a sense in the <unk> , the sense of parenting .
( Laughter ) Now , this is what we learned to do with our own <unk> in our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to do that .
We have no idea , we don &apos;t have a <unk> , if we fail until we fail .
There &apos;s another reason why we &apos;re going to do it , and it &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s more unstable .
I mean , imagine a <unk> school .
You &apos;re going to be angry , and you &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , this is not my birthday .
( Laughter ) So that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and you know , think about what we think about , what we think is going to look like this .
He <unk> and <unk> , he never makes a difference .
So , as far as you &apos;ve learned , you &apos;ve learned that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be wondering , you know , you &apos;re going
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Most of us , and I think , especially , especially in this room , is treated by this <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Or don &apos;t , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the same thing , it &apos;s the same thing .
( Laughter ) So , as a movie , you all know , you &apos;re all going to be dead , and you &apos;re going to see it .
Go .
It &apos;s only when we realized that we may be able to figure out that we are perhaps in the wrong way .
Because in this case , if we do our <unk> , we &apos;re going to pretend that something is not about us .
So we &apos;re going to focus on your own , because we don &apos;t feel comfortable with ourselves , and we &apos;re going to be angry , and we &apos;re going to be angry .
Let &apos;s tell you about an accident .
A few years ago , a <unk> named <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This hospital lies in a <unk> .
At this point , this <unk> <unk> student students , and he &apos;s one of the things that he was doing .
There was a woman who was born and raised in the room .
And she was sitting in front of her classmates , and he sat down on her shoulder , and he snuck over her bedroom , and he snuck in her bedroom .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to do that ?
And when I was talking about this , he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; something really happened to me .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; that he was working on a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , why am I concerned about it , because what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , you &apos;re going to be a little bit like this .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is us all the time we feel , you know , no matter what happens in the world .
And if we &apos;re in our office , we only think about it as well as possible , and we don &apos;t even think about it , we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that , and we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
It &apos;s a big problem for a <unk> problem .
But that &apos;s even more important for society .
<unk> on the <unk> , which means their sense of self-worth .
That &apos;s what your mind is , you know , your heart rate .
Well , with this <unk> , the challenge is to tell people what to do with you .
<unk> that most of us have to do with some of the other things that most of us have to do with other people with their own <unk> .
So the first thing we think is , if somebody , we don &apos;t think they &apos;re wrong , they don &apos;t care about the answer .
They don &apos;t have access to the information that you have , and if you look at this information with them , they &apos;re going to get them out of your wallet .
Now , if it doesn &apos;t happen , if we look at what they &apos;re going to do with us , but we don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do with us , but we &apos;re going to get into the back of the second <unk> — that &apos;s what they are .
( Laughter ) Before they all have a lot of stuff to do , and they don &apos;t care about it .
And if it doesn &apos;t work , if we realize that people don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t know what people don &apos;t have to do , you know , they &apos;re pretty good at the same time , and they &apos;re going to know that they know , but for their own <unk> , we &apos;re going to know the truth , but for their own <unk> , we &apos;re going to know the truth .
It &apos;s a disaster .
Now , when you look at the end of the world , we don &apos;t have a very good thing to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re learning about , especially if it &apos;s not going to be true , and we &apos;re going to connect us to each other .
And what I &apos;m doing is , I think , more than all of this , I think , is this kind of thing that I think we &apos;re going to have to do with our humanity .
<unk> , we want to believe that our grandparents are the ones that we can see , that we can measure them in orbit , which is exactly what we do .
And what we want to do is to look at all the things that we want to look at , and we saw exactly what &apos;s happening .
It &apos;s the same thing , and it would be incredible .
Our mind is not that we can see the light that we can see .
It &apos;s what we can see in this way that we can see the light .
We can have a <unk> debate about the future , and we can imagine , as other people in other places .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s because everyone sees it , we can look at the end of the universe and see it , and that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s also because we are .
And over about the 200 years , as a result , as a result , I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
<unk> realized that the fact of the fact that the fact is that the fact is that we don &apos;t have any idea of the ethical system , it &apos;s not something that you want to do .
That &apos;s what we do .
Because we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t really know what this world is doing .
<unk> from other animals , we &apos;re not trying to do this light .
Now , I think that this is a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
I started to listen to a lot of medical programs , and I started to listen to a lot of medical programs , &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> life . &quot;
I &apos;m sure , listen , and I &apos;ve been thinking , and I &apos;m going to experience that all of the things I &apos;m going to do is that all of the things that I &apos;m going to do .
I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m always always going to be crazy .
She seems everywhere .
But as many months at the time , I had the opportunity to interview a program called a <unk> program .
I mean , I &apos;m going to do this with it , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really something . &quot;
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I mean , it &apos;s even going to have a program even though that in every single one .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I thought it &apos;s going to be something that I thought it was going to do , and it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which is interesting , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is that we have to do this .
We need a lot of things that we need to do , and we need to make sure that we &apos;re going to have these <unk> , &quot; &quot; What about all of us , &quot; &quot; you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
We have <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
What we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to have a <unk> .
But you know , you know , we &apos;re going to be aware that our own life is .
We think that will be true .
George Bush thought that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it happened .
And also , the reason for Mubarak was , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to be true for the end of your life as long as it wasn &apos;t going to be the end of the life of life as though it wasn &apos;t going to be broken , and then it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
And it happened .
And what you &apos;ve got to do is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to know that it &apos;s going to be wrong .
And it happened .
I &apos;ve got to tell you that I &apos;m going to write a book about something that I &apos;m going to write about something that I &apos;m going to write a book about something that would never be possible .
And it happened .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a life .
We &apos;re going to look forward to ideas about the gravitational light , which is not the best thing to do , and it &apos;s not the other thing that &apos;s going to do , and the rest of us would be .
You don &apos;t know , but the whole thing is that there &apos;s a little bit like a <unk> of our <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to put together a whole bunch of work with innovation , and we &apos;re going to be able to innovate , but you know why we need these innovations , and we &apos;re going to be able to innovate ?
Because half the ideas that were crazy , they had the ability to change the world , and they had the ability to change the world .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t worry , or not ? ( Laughter )
Where my <unk> <unk> , Chris Anderson ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we come over here .
And it &apos;s going to be exhausting .
So we did another idea .
We have another story .
We &apos;re going to do this with another .
<unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ve already heard seven million times , is like a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , I mean , if you really want to be able to do this , I mean , that &apos;s why the limits of the limits of the limits of the space and the <unk> of the space of your grandparents &apos; and the mystery of the Universe and the founder of the Universe , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m going to panic . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
5 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At the beginning , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So fortunately , these plans were the ultimate <unk> FBI .
But I &apos;m sorry to do that , but I don &apos;t want to do that , but I don &apos;t want to do that .
And as a result , as a result , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in <unk> , and I was born , and I was born in my family , and I had a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and he started to ask my childhood <unk> .
But if I was seven years old , I was born in our family , and I started <unk> .
My father showed me that I had a little friend of mine who had a little <unk> to see , including even most Muslims .
And my experience shows that when people do one of each other , they take a lot of time to understand that we want to do one of the same thing .
But in fact , in the same way , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , there &apos;s a lot of people who are willing to choose their own <unk> , so that they can make the rest of their own lives .
And for a few months , I had a father who sat me and told me that several years later , and I told me that a few years later , he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach in Long Beach .
He said that the next thing I was going to do with it .
We &apos;re going to look at the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> FBI .
I mean , that day , my last year was in the little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and it was a <unk> <unk> , and it was in my head , and she was in the middle of my mother .
My father was a friend of mine , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; My father was a father , a father .
They &apos;ve got very hard to do this , but only within a few years , I realized it was the meaning of it .
They &apos;ve seen me firsthand the same thing , which was my father .
Now , as a result of these people , they had a <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It was the men that I was doing .
<unk> people I &apos;m going to call &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means .
I &apos;m going to get a place for 20 times , and that &apos;s my childhood experience with me in my childhood <unk> .
Every time I started to experience myself in one place , I &apos;m going to take an hour of my life in one place where I &apos;m going to do something else .
<unk> is always a new teacher at the class , and I often had a little <unk> .
I &apos;m going to focus on my <unk> , because I &apos;m not going to get the attention , but I &apos;m not going to be able to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going
They &apos;re playing games playing games .
And what I &apos;ve learned is that my social media had been inspired by saying , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been able to put people on a pedestal called <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or race .
What does my eyes give me ?
First of all , the majority of them were inspired by the educational challenge , and it happened during 2003 .
I was able to figure out that I was able to jump in a way that I was going to be able to do with a <unk> <unk> .
My group had been violence .
Members of our groups are using the most different institutions .
Once again , I would argue that one of my new friends had been <unk> .
Because this is just a few days ago , a few days later , a few days later , I &apos;m going to be diagnosed with this .
I had never had my friends before , and I &apos;m honest , I &apos;m going to tell you that I was going to be able to speak that I was going to have a <unk> bar that I had never had my life .
<unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;ve been bringing people around the world and the cultures , and that experience is fundamentally fundamental in my personality .
It wasn &apos;t a good thing to do .
Like , I &apos;ve had an opportunity to be able to do this , and I had an opportunity to be able to do that , and I quickly realized that many of them were going to be the same thing , and I quickly realized that many of them were really impaired and I quickly realized that many of them were really impaired and I quickly realized that many of them were affected by <unk> and I quickly realized that many of them were affected by men and women , and I quickly realized that many of them
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , as a child , had a sense of embarrassment for me , and for me , for me , I &apos;m going to have a sense of appreciation for other people , and it &apos;s not like I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
It &apos;s a sense of what I was going to do with me , which I was born in the checklisted childhood , from the <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to be a coward .
And then , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and every <unk> John <unk> John <unk> me to be able to tell me about my own self , and I told me that race was not going to be a good thing to do with my own understanding of my own self .
And in many <unk> , he had a <unk> , which I had so <unk> .
<unk> , you know , when you don &apos;t , you know , I &apos;m going to understand that I &apos;m going to understand that I &apos;m going to understand that I &apos;m going to do more than I am .
And one day I was talking to my mother about how I started my mother , and she told me something that I &apos;m going to do in my heart .
She looked at me in front of me , and he looked at me on my eyes for more than a long time , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do a <unk> .
And at that moment , I realized how much energy the power of energy is going to make it happen .
Zack <unk> is not my name .
I &apos;m going to shake it when my family and my family , and I decided to do this .
So what I was going to do is encourage me to tell my identity and my grandparents &apos; ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I do that for me , I do that , I &apos;m doing this in a sense that somebody has to tell me , and I think that , instead of violence , there &apos;s a better way to do that , because I &apos;m not going to be disappointed .
Instead , I &apos;m going to take my experiences with my experiences in my experience with my experiences in <unk> .
I do this for a while , and I &apos;m doing this for both of them , and for them , for the fear and the dangers of the pain of the <unk> .
So , on my mind , I &apos;m going to talk about these <unk> , and I &apos;m going to talk to my parents .
I mean , I &apos;ve been able to see that violence is not the case that violence is not the dominant part of the race or the race , and that the son don &apos;t want to follow their parents .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you so much . ( Applause )
Or it might be a question of whether or not we &apos;re going to steal your kids .
They &apos;re not the best for another .
I can help make a big deal with less <unk> .
When I was an outsider , it was a <unk> , when I was an outsider .
You know , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my head in my <unk> , &quot; &quot; Olé !
And then you &apos;ve got to study <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
He <unk> , because the better thing is not there .
So you can see that it &apos;s going to be able to tell you a good choice .
But it can &apos;t be .
When you look at good good , I think it seems like a thought .
The hour at home , and so forth .
<unk> , a career , will allow you to allow you to give you a career .
We have <unk> <unk> .
When you look at the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be on a pedestal .
And you &apos;ve made a sense for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense for yourself .
( Laughter ) What we do is , if we do , we &apos;re going to be angry .
I &apos;m the one who love <unk> .
When we look at it for ourselves , it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Well , if we don &apos;t care for yourself .
You &apos;re going to celebrate the most <unk> .
A few years ago , and then I decided to go back to the path , and I decided to go back to the path , the <unk> <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go through these <unk> <unk> .
Instead of <unk> , it wasn &apos;t for months , an hour became a lot more <unk> .
This picture of my grandfather , when I was doing this , I was doing this for every day .
I &apos;m never going to get wet .
I &apos;m also <unk> .
In fact , <unk> <unk> is not to go to bed .
( Laughter ) But I &apos;m going to get rid of your <unk> <unk> .
She <unk> .
I wasn &apos;t talking to saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to look at the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to say I &apos;m going to say I &apos;m going to say I &apos;m going to say .
I realized that when I was doing this , I realized I was going to change the change , and I was going to look at it , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , what I did is I &apos;m going to do this .
And the truth is , they do .
( Applause )
I &apos;ve been incredibly excited about the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the world in the world to be <unk> .
In 1975 , if I was seven years old , women were in the <unk> .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , and they had a sense of whether or not they had a good place to do .
They came up with a <unk> <unk> <unk> — 90 percent of women and women who were invited to ask themselves about <unk> .
<unk> didn &apos;t work in a single day because it doesn &apos;t work for women .
( Applause ) Within five years , the <unk> had been awarded to be the first <unk> in the world , which is the <unk> path of a woman in the world .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , when the President of the congregation was going to be in front of us , came out on the balcony of his house , and they came up with a <unk> .
( Applause ) It became a <unk> <unk> for me and all of the people who grew up in that hour , including <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of a great story about the idea that she was going to do with her , and she said , &quot; &quot; How can it be possible to be a little girl , if you &apos;re going to win ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) <unk> models actually have a matter , but even with a lot of pressure , it &apos;s really a matter , but even with a lot of pressure , it &apos;s really a matter of value , but even with a lot of pressure , it was like , &quot;
Who am I going to be able to be compassionate ? &quot; &quot; <unk> that women are less vulnerable than men .
<unk> , <unk> in the United States in 2011 , would argue that 62 percent of the men who had been arrested for their <unk> , but only 45 percent women .
We see in 16 percent , and this is the same thing , and this is the same thing that &apos;s going to do .
It &apos;s a real <unk> , because I &apos;m going to argue that this world needs more and more inclusive leadership .
And so my decision is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I &apos;m going to do with my own <unk> , even without any <unk> <unk> , I want to stand ahead and take it back to the end of the world that &apos;s going to be the meaning of the world that will be the meaning of the meaning of the world that will be the meaning of the meaning of the world that we really want to do .
It was my life .
It was great .
<unk> started with 20 <unk> <unk> .
And then , after the last year , I was going to be able to go back to the end of the <unk> , and finally , we ended up being rejected , three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not another drama .
<unk> , you know , the United States has a drama , but I can tell you — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that and we are in the <unk> <unk> .
First of the last 20 years , the president of the last 20 years , of course , is that it wasn &apos;t going to be wrong , it &apos;s perhaps the effect of that .
And then he <unk> , when we got dressed in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who had had his family and his family .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , such as the president of the president , what the Swedes need to do .
And in a few days , the connection of his family and her family and her family and her family was born with a <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t the same way that he said , &quot; &quot; What does it do , because there are two men of men who are able to be able to be diagnosed with <unk> <unk> .
So , nine years old , for 45 days right now , on the right hand , the right thing for me was not very good .
I don &apos;t even know the room in the <unk> room .
<unk> <unk> , I had one percent , but every one , it was a <unk> <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got to make sure that I was going to be able to wear all of them to get their own room for her to get their place on a pedestal , because the <unk> decided that he was going to end up with two 2.5 percent of their voices on the top .
And the same thing that I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to be there with three men , and I &apos;m going to be there with three men , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have a couple two and a half .
( Applause ) And on behalf .
The problem with that , from which we had to do , was to be connected to the point , and they were going to be connected , and they were going to be connected .
<unk> .
Some of the things that the floor would have done is that the gender of my grandparents would be able to do it .
I couldn &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ve been able to have access to access to access , such as an hour in the media .
And I was talking about the <unk> , and I was going to talk about the <unk> media for a few months before they had a few months before I was born .
And I don &apos;t just tell you what it is .
And I thought that the reason is that the reason is that the reason in the media is , because in the media , there is a <unk> and a <unk> , and we have to do something about it when we want to change .
When I was going to get access to TB , the answer is , &quot; &quot; Are you going to kill your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And that was a final question .
<unk> , from one to two and a half , two percent of the voice on it .
But the media is really the value , and every time I got to TB , we saw , and it felt like I &apos;m going to be able to deal with it , and I know that it &apos;s important , and why we need to worry about it .
And I had a <unk> , and I had never been able to interview my first <unk> .
I was looking for a little bit beyond the question that the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the world are broken .
I &apos;m going to do this , but I &apos;m going to tell you this , but I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
There was no longer any way to get rid of me in front of me or <unk> .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s do it .
But there &apos;s one more important experience .
I &apos;m going to be able to do that , I &apos;m going to be like <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
It has to take a sense of understanding and access to the resources of our company , but also to make sure that we don &apos;t want to do it differently .
Our company was <unk> , and so we got the tone of the voice for others .
Mo in this reason , the reason I wanted to show you , is that I wanted to look at the other way .
If you have access to <unk> <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to do something about information .
I &apos;m going to focus on Facebook , while I &apos;m going to focus on Facebook questions .
All right , all sorts of things together , and we &apos;re going to look at that in front of us , because we believed in the <unk> , because we used to believe in the <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> .
And when it turned out to be inspired by a young man &apos;s attention , I started to use <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you how to do it , and I &apos;m going to look at each other , and I &apos;m going to look at each other at home .
I really got to find a lot of <unk> and <unk> , because I &apos;m going to panic .
But because of that , we grew up with a number of <unk> <unk> .
I think it &apos;s possible to have a company and a way to do it .
I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t care about a lot of money .
And what it does is , it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true , and it was less inclusive , and we had less resources .
<unk> , the reason it &apos;s partly was that , in my opinion , an hour of the story was to be able to focus on the <unk> .
And maybe I &apos;m going to do more with this more <unk> .
Some say that this is very specific .
But even with the media and the <unk> media , and it &apos;s just the same thing , but we had a lot of all of the things that we have had ever done in a daily basis when the first number of numbers .
I appreciate myself , as you can see on a pedestal .
( Laughter ) <unk> of the whole data , I was walking with a <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Well , too long , as a wound , because I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do it , but took another place , and we came out of the end , and we came up with the <unk> of the <unk> , which was 10 percent of the voices that were going to be 10 percent of the <unk> .
Now , these are some sort of <unk> , and I &apos;ve got a lot of people around me , and there are many people going to get me back .
But in fact , I &apos;m going to make a sense of what I was going to do , which is that I was going to be able to make a little bit more <unk> , and the big number of people I &apos;ve got to do with me , and the big number of people I &apos;m going to do in 2040 is by 2040 .
( Applause ) Now she &apos;s 13 , and it never happened before .
But in my seventeenth birthday , I was going to take her on her to TB , and she was <unk> , she was his mother .
<unk> , it was the <unk> of my company .
( Applause ) But it was another one .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
This is a picture for me .
We can achieve what you see .
Yes , fear and problems .
( Applause ) <unk> in the public needs , and the hour of the woman &apos;s office , let &apos;s say it &apos;s going to be a <unk> or <unk> .
And I &apos;m also going to tell you a little bit of what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; The New Yorker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I got a new quote : &quot; &quot; <unk> ergo <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;ve got a new <unk> , because women are too often deformed for me , because women are too often deformed for me , but I know , I know , I know what we &apos;re doing when we do .
( Applause ) And we need to be more useful .
And one day , we had a <unk> , because that &apos;s how we felt .
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> .
You &apos;ve got to go to that , and you &apos;re going to go to it , and your family , and all of you who are going to work with you , if you &apos;re going to feel good , you &apos;re going to be good at all .
We &apos;re going to be good at the time , and I &apos;m going to ask why I &apos;m going to do this journey , more than I can share with you on a pedestal .
But it wasn &apos;t obvious , it was a lot of work .
I was sleeping with my grandfather .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know , and I wasn &apos;t going to be able to figure out what I knew was one of the things that I knew was one of the things that I knew was one of the things that I knew was one of the things that I knew that I had had to do with one of the things that I was like to say .
As a parent , a good friend of mine , you know , you &apos;re going to get rid of your <unk> , but you &apos;re never going to appreciate you .
I want to share with you , and you all know , you all know , every single one of your most important things is your team .
The people around you , the obstacles of the values of the values and the integrity of the other .
For me , this is what &apos;s going to be successful , and I &apos;m going to tell you the amazing things that I &apos;m going to do today with my family — ( Applause ) and my friends and my friends , we &apos;re going to be able to figure out how to deal with the <unk> and <unk> things , in the words of the words .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to talk to you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a decision for what I &apos;m going to do if I &apos;m going to get seven percent .
I take it to the point of view , because perhaps he &apos;s going to be right , and I think it &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s going to be wrong .
But on one evening , I thought I was going to show you what it is .
It &apos;s a very important thing , because I really rarely slept , and I &apos;ve been working on working with me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to achieve a lot if you &apos;re going to look at a lot of it .
And I think it &apos;s really important for me to think about it , and it &apos;s really important , and it &apos;s really important , and it &apos;s not less important , it &apos;s not less important , it &apos;s not less important , it &apos;s not less important , and it &apos;s not less important , and it &apos;s not more important than that , but it &apos;s not .
So this has been completely different , and I decided to do something , and I wasn &apos;t going to focus on the <unk> , partly because of my power .
When I look at a moment at a moment — and this is an hour of the time , and it was an hour of the time , because I was an outsider , and I was going to focus on my creative understanding , and I &apos;m not just just like that .
And I called our company <unk> , where the H means &quot; &quot; Olé . &quot;
The first one of them is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to try to make sure that I &apos;m going to be able to deal with leadership as a coward , and I wanted to make the leadership as a coward .
Another word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or <unk> .
I decided to do that .
And you can see that there was a lot , no matter what it was , and it was a <unk> item .
And I &apos;m going to do all the things I want to do with that .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was a <unk> for all of this .
I had no idea , and I had no idea on Facebook or Facebook .
I mean , you know , I think you &apos;re going to ask the answers to your question .
There are less important words in the room that we don &apos;t need to do , we &apos;ve got to invest in public health care , which is the power of power .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m really excited about what I found was that I found a lot of patience , so that we can get the success in order to make sure that the success is going to be true .
I can &apos;t tell you what it was simple , but I &apos;m going to panic , and I think , on my team , a team of <unk> , it was <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not going to give you some of you . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) And I can &apos;t tell you that I can &apos;t tell you , I don &apos;t have any of you .
I mean , maybe all of the things in this room are willing to do that , and you &apos;re going to do it .
We &apos;re not going to be able to deal with the rights of the voice there , but there &apos;s something that we can take in the wrong way , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s long enough to remember the 1975 of a year where women are going to go on the street , and it &apos;s really become <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to look at it before , and you &apos;re going to look at it before , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to look at it .
And you can see , because the media of the media doesn &apos;t want to do it , but in the <unk> of women &apos;s women again . Right ?
TBP : Yes . PM : Should we tell us about this ?
<unk> : 41 years from now that we can measure the world in the world to be realistic , but we &apos;re going to be able to do that in the world as well as we &apos;re working on .
So , <unk> , the women in college have a job , because it &apos;s time for this hour , they &apos;re going to have their own <unk> .
( Applause ) So what happened was that there was something that was broken , and the young people were going to pay attention to the most than before , because it was an hour ago , because it &apos;s an hour of the day .
PM : I &apos;m not going to talk about it now , but I &apos;m not going to ask you , but I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be a big deal with this , if you &apos;re going to do it again .
Thank you .
CR : Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , I tried to think about my career , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to left my career , &quot; &quot; and the best example I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to go to The New Yorker , a few years ago .
<unk> <unk> , you know , &quot; &quot; Dad , if I grow up , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be dead . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to get the whole thing that the people in the world have ever seen before , to meet people from the world .
I was not only about 50 <unk> in the United States , but we have dinner with my wife .
We &apos;re not just talking about <unk> or <unk> , but it &apos;s also the <unk> of the <unk> that live in the most <unk> Africa .
I mean , it &apos;s a <unk> person , and knowing the light as I know that I can say , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; which is the violence on women and zeros .
There &apos;s a few of the reasons I &apos;m going to do .
<unk> for all this , this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
They put them together , so they said that women are obese in a way that women are obese compared to men in favor of God .
It was a few years ago , in 2000 , I was a <unk> , and I was a <unk> , and I was going to go back to the last 70 years , and I was going to be able to go back to the <unk> School of every year , and I &apos;m going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m also going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m going to be able to do that in 2000 .
So what they &apos;re going to do is , in fact , the <unk> of women who are supposed to be in the way that women are going to be angry , they &apos;re going to be dead in the middle , or a woman who is born in the classroom , and she doesn &apos;t know if she was born in the classroom , because you can find it in the room , because you can find out in the room , because you can find out in the room , and you can find a little bit
But you know , it &apos;s something that you want to do , and that &apos;s what you want to do with the men in a way that the men are in the world .
It &apos;s a critical problem because men can be capable of powerful power , for example , when the husband or whether or whether men are being able to understand women &apos;s power , for example .
So why should I be able to pay it with the same thing as a <unk> ?
( Laughter ) I mean , that &apos;s the problem with violence .
In the United States , for example , we &apos;ve had a <unk> increase in the United States , and the people who were exposed to the people and their peers who were in jail .
One of the 1,000 Americans are in <unk> .
Now , a lot of people are going to be able to do a 1,000 <unk> .
It &apos;s a huge increase .
From the time I left the house , I &apos;ve got an increase for 800 percent of the women in the hospital .
We are one of the things that we have to do with the planet , which I had in my head , and I had a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to put a place in one of the things that &apos;s going to be in the world .
We &apos;re now in California , and I &apos;m going to spend the other day that I &apos;m going to pay for four dollars per year by 13 people in the <unk> .
I mean , you know .
At this week , the law for this week is a legal law , which is a <unk> law , and it &apos;s not to be able to do it , and it &apos;s going to be like violence and <unk> , and it &apos;s the only one who &apos;s going to do with violence on women .
I &apos;m going to be able to panic .
And they &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> .
But in the few countries , in many countries , in many countries , in many countries , in many countries , there &apos;s a little girl in her life , and it &apos;s going to be in a way that &apos;s going to be a <unk> piece of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> so that the girl can do so that she can &apos;t be a girl .
And then , when she was married , it would be like to marry the same thing to be healthy .
It &apos;s not to do it , but it &apos;s not about law enforcement , but it &apos;s not <unk> .
<unk> , for example , 91 of the women living in the world today , and they &apos;ve been trained today .
In a few countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of women who have been willing to do so well .
It &apos;s <unk> for all women who live in countries .
The other thing is , &quot; &quot; One is a very serious thing , &quot; &quot; where I was in my head with my grandfather , isn &apos;t anything that I was going to do with my family , and when she was married or she was married or she &apos;s married to marry or sometimes , even if she was born .
It &apos;s done by their family , and so my family , as a teenager , when the girl was going to be a kid in her family .
It was not so recent , it was a <unk> , and it showed that 75 percent of those women were diagnosed with <unk> or <unk> or 25 percent of the women &apos;s leading women .
The biggest problem that there is in the world in favor of women is slavery , or human beings , as it &apos;s called .
About seven million people were born in the middle and 18 months .
30 million people live today in slavery .
In the United States , I &apos;m going to have the United States of the United States , every year , and <unk> <unk> , across the course of every year , 80 percent of those deaths — women who are competing with slavery .
In the United States , it &apos;s in that moment , 60,000 people live in the United States or in slavery .
Atlanta , <unk> , where are the <unk> and where I &apos;ve been growing up in the middle of the world , between 200 and 300 women .
This is the place in the middle of the room .
There &apos;s also a lot of <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the <unk> , you want to be able to do that for 1,000 dollars .
A 16-year-old student , a <unk> student , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , Wyoming .
So that &apos;s another really bad thing , because there &apos;s no way in the United States , because there &apos;s no way in the United States , but it &apos;s not a good thing to do , because we don &apos;t know it .
It &apos;s a big thing to do with the <unk> , the women in the world , the women in the world .
It &apos;s a good approach to this .
A year for a year , a year ago , decided to change the law , and women are no longer in law when they &apos;re born in slavery , but by the end of the <unk> — ( Applause ) — I went down to a decline .
The United States , the United States .
At the same time , <unk> 25 women were born in the United States .
Canada , <unk> , I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the other country is going to go right now .
It &apos;s one on the right that can be done .
We have two big things that we &apos;re going to do in our bodies , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that I did , says , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to be in the room .
Only 3,000 years old , and the reason is , the reason is that there is any organization on any organization , and the reason is that it &apos;s a <unk> boat , it &apos;s a <unk> , like May , a <unk> boat on a decision , and , of course , what they want is , of course , what they want to do , that they don &apos;t want to do that .
This law needs to be exhausting .
Now , it &apos;s going to be a very good thing to do , and this is now a lot of <unk> , partly from my book , but it &apos;s because of the other things that I &apos;ve been talking about , but because of the other things , it &apos;s in the United States , in the United States , because it &apos;s a great personality to protect them from domestic violence .
The <unk> says , at the end of the car , you know , on campus , because there &apos;s a great thing to do when they give someone to someone , but when they &apos;re sentenced to someone on campus .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
It &apos;s the things that we &apos;re going to have to do .
You &apos;re going to have a very serious sign on the right on top of that , and you don &apos;t know . ( Applause ) And this is the clock for the clock .
When I became a <unk> , it was about 39 <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to do this , and so forth — ( Applause ) — ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 hours for the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening now .
If you &apos;ve got 500 companies , in 23 of them , with 500 , and these dragons , I &apos;m going to tell you that at the risk of less than others .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on in our <unk> .
There &apos;s another problem with <unk> <unk> : we are the oldest ones on Earth .
We &apos;re going to be born in the world since World War II .
Our grandparents were on the ground .
<unk> together , we are focused on the <unk> , <unk> bombs .
<unk> , of course , now we have <unk> .
We were in an era of 25 different challenges or more of the World War II .
Over the years of age , I &apos;m not going to be saying , we &apos;re not <unk> — ( Applause ) — we &apos;re not going to be able to run bombs .
But in any case , the things that we have to do is , in any way , the people who are concerned about violence and the evidence of violence on women .
The other one is one of the reasons why the men , the men , the men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
A young man who might say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; I mean , if I was so small , it &apos;s very similar to what I was like when I was small , when I was so small , when I was a small kid .
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> , the end of the war between the <unk> , the war , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the Rights of the law .
But in the course of that time , there were many white people who didn &apos;t know what they were going to do , but they weren &apos;t good enough , because they would be humiliated , because it was the same thing to do today , because it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to exist today , because it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to exist today , because it &apos;s the same thing .
Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , they &apos;re using <unk> .
They are inspired by the self-organizing system , most of the men who are going to create the immune system , the vast majority of the people who are going to live in the world , and most of the men who are going to find a big deal .
Do we have to do today ?
I would like , well , the best thing that we could do for women with me , and where you &apos;re going to be willing to do that for women to be able to take care of it , to be more willing to be more willing to end up in order to be more willing to end up in order to be more concerned about the world .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m saying in my mind .
But I hope that , after this point , women have focused on their own , on college campuses , on college campuses , and in the future , and in the future , we need to protect our <unk> and <unk> .
I have 12 <unk> , and I &apos;m going to give up my kids and 10 <unk> , and I often think about them , and on behalf of them , not only if they lived in trouble with them , and I hope that all of you are going to be willing to be brave for women and women around the world , and protect them right now .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
When I was in the middle of it , I was going to be able to see the world seemed to be <unk> .
<unk> growth wasn &apos;t going to stop .
<unk> <unk> was a <unk> .
The cancer of cancer , the <unk> of cancer , is going to be born in front of our lives .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> would be <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t going to happen . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , if you look at the end of the population of the population on the head of the population on average on behalf of the United States , on average three times .
In fact , I &apos;ve had a <unk> life for 30 percent .
<unk> <unk> <unk> on two thirds .
There &apos;s a lot of food per capita on the population .
One of the things that I got more excited about the question is , how do you look at this ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In order to answer this question , you have to understand how to look at it , and you should be able to figure out how to deal with it , and you want to be able to figure out what &apos;s going on on your behalf .
In other words , you have to understand how sex is sex .
So I want you to imagine that we &apos;ve got to look at how we &apos;re going to look at how to create this kind of thing .
For 30,000 generations .
<unk> , and it was a few changes , but the app for the skeleton in those days .
It &apos;s a <unk> phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
I mean , at that time , on the right hand , on the top five years .
<unk> is the same thing .
And from the end of the course , I &apos;m going to be able to share some of the things that are going to be wrong , and it &apos;s going to be wrong .
And more than that , in terms of ideas — ideas , ideas , ideas , ideas .
They were <unk> together in this technology .
And this is a <unk> technology , and that &apos;s why I think this is the key to what &apos;s happening in the world .
The heart of the human body is also <unk> ideas : the idea of the idea of the brain , the idea of the brain , the idea of the <unk> of the brain .
They cook together .
How do you want to look at something like a <unk> ?
She <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> species , if you put two different pieces in different contexts .
One of the things that &apos;s going to do is to make a difference .
And one of the things that you can do is to be able to be able to do that in the same way that the person would be able to be able to do this , in the same way .
And so this is the kind of thing that you have to do with the <unk> innovation of all species .
It &apos;s not the ultimate <unk> .
So that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to do with the advent of the Industrial Revolution , which is going to be in my <unk> ?
I think that the answer is , this is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> doesn &apos;t do that .
Culture can be no longer .
Maybe a <unk> culture .
<unk> has a culture .
They &apos;re taught one of the women who were born from parents who were born .
<unk> <unk> .
But the answer is , you know , the answer is .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t have any <unk> .
So , why do you want to prioritize the standard ?
The answer is , the answer is that we are going to be born in college .
And I think it &apos;s an idea in the picture of the 20th century that it has to be in the middle of the 20th century .
Adam <unk> <unk> for four hours and three hours .
And &quot; &quot; Oz <unk> &quot; &quot; for one hour and two hours later .
Oz is the best for Adam and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> Adam <unk> .
He can do their own <unk> and <unk> .
Now , &quot; &quot; The Oz <unk> two <unk> and Adam <unk> two <unk> , &quot; &quot; and Adam <unk> two <unk> and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and
So for a while , it &apos;s going to make a difference for the <unk> , and so forth .
Adam and Oz is going to take their time .
I mean , you know , as long as long as you &apos;ve got to work , if you &apos;re going to work , you know , if you &apos;re going to be able to work , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to work with the book .
When you look at the first , you &apos;ve got to go out .
How much do you do that ? There &apos;s a lot of time .
How many are you going to work on an hour for an hour of an hour , if you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve got seven and a half seconds of yours compared to 1950 .
You &apos;re going to be waiting for 15 minutes to look at these numbers on the equivalent of the <unk> .
You should be working for six hours so that you &apos;re going to be willing to go on a pedestal , which is for an hour .
So let &apos;s go back and forth and ask the question of the question , &quot; Who has made them and for whom ? &quot;
<unk> on the right was made for me to do other people .
How much does it do it ?
<unk> ? <unk> ?
You know , I think millions .
For me .
And that &apos;s how it works .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at .
The clock is the clock when you were married , people literally worked on you .
They &apos;ve done it with a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s been able to do this . ( Laughter ) And what they did was , he said , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , they &apos;re going to do it , and it &apos;s in that way .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> pit .
But the <unk> <unk> , which is going to look at the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and it &apos;s going to give you a good food for an hour after that , and what they &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to give you a good food for an hour after that .
Think of each other .
In fact , there are other things that work on one .
<unk> is an example .
<unk> is <unk> .
Even though we don &apos;t , we don &apos;t have any <unk> .
( Applause ) So , what did these behaviors do ?
I mean , this is a <unk> <unk> .
But I don &apos;t have this .
There &apos;s a <unk> working on food .
<unk> men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that she &apos;s going to have a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> knows .
And the guy knows that he wasn &apos;t going to be able to do it .
Everything we need to do is , you know , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> didn &apos;t do that .
They were hired by <unk> <unk> .
They were very smart .
But there was no sense of what they were doing .
There is no <unk> for women .
<unk> women together with men .
There &apos;s no way to do this , but it doesn &apos;t have to be a <unk> , because you know , you know , you know , you know , the tools that they &apos;ve done , the tools that they &apos;ve done , are always taken from the <unk> .
For example , there &apos;s a place where there was a place where there was a <unk> device .
They &apos;ve always been done with <unk> <unk> .
The same thing is , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , there &apos;s a lot of people in the same way that you can see in the world , and you can see that it &apos;s a very long term .
And if the person started to do this , this is what they &apos;re talking about , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> for thousands of years ago in Africa where we look at that , and the other thing we see is that it &apos;s going to be big .
It &apos;s also <unk> — it was like a <unk> , a <unk> , a 200 miles away with a <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what a group of people started to do .
And this is led to <unk> .
They &apos;re going to put them in front of them , and they do things like this , and they look at them as a result , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do .
What &apos;s going to happen when you get rid of the locals , from the context of the suffering and the opportunity ?
The answer is , it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t even make it in a way .
This is what &apos;s going to do with it .
<unk> <unk> , compared to the people with their own , they &apos;re really lonely .
It wasn &apos;t because the population in 4,000 people have been paid enough to support the skills that they need to do with their technology .
<unk> wasn &apos;t going to be on a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , this is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Well , they were <unk> .
So to go back and forth , and not just who did it , not only who did it , but who knew how to do it ?
No one is literally no one .
There &apos;s a person who doesn &apos;t know .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be the same , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the 1950s .
And what we &apos;ve done in this is that we &apos;ve made a sense of what we &apos;ve done in order to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same thing .
But if you have the technology of the technology of the technology .
In fact , in fact , because I &apos;m not going to focus on the level of happiness , whether it &apos;s a little bit more specific IQ than other groups .
It &apos;s not my fault .
It has a matter of how good people do have their ideas , and how good it is , rather than what they &apos;re doing , rather than the moral one .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> brain .
We &apos;re just going to look at the <unk> .
We are neurons neurons .
<unk> ideas , <unk> and <unk> ideas are one of the same <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> are less than less or less .
Now , the future , as we take forward , is that we don &apos;t have anything .
<unk> war , depression , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> things in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also convinced that the way that people are connected to the idea of the idea of the people , and the idea of being able to get better , I &apos;m sure that technology is going to be wrong .
And because of course it &apos;s going to be through the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk>
Thank you .
