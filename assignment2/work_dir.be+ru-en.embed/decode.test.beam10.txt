I mean , it will be about the end of this year , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the human being able to use .
They told them what they &apos;re going to do .
Now this is a utopian thought , but I think it &apos;s a pretty good idea , but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s my own .
I thought about that , and I thought about it , and I thought about it as a leader in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , that died from cancer .
<unk> <unk> of his family , and the friends of his family writing the director of his death .
This is what he did at the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s me . &quot; &quot; I died , and that &apos;s my last chapter .
I wasn &apos;t interested in my heart , as I was getting rid of my heart , my family , my family , my friends , I had a message that I wrote as the first part of my blog with my blog , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s like a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be better , and more <unk> , and on the right , you know , all the things that are going to be able to be able
<unk> a little girl .
Today , 48 hours of YouTube videos on YouTube .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> builds up 90 pounds per month .
If you &apos;re talking about their parents or their grandparents , they &apos;ve created a couple of <unk> , or a colleague of mine , or a <unk> , who is a <unk> <unk> .
But today , we &apos;re going to be incredibly optimistic that we &apos;re going to live in <unk> <unk> that &apos;s going to live as long after we die .
And I think that this creates an incredibly powerful opportunity for <unk> .
For example , I &apos;m not going to be disappointed , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do that , because I would like to be able to make sure that the future and the future will be <unk> .
We &apos;ve seen some of the things that allow us to be able to decide what to do with us , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with our own , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that .
And one of them , in fact , had a very , very few people , and I found myself in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
( Singing ) Adam : <unk> .
<unk> : Adam ?
And so .
<unk> : <unk> can get you from any room at any time , even though it &apos;s even a <unk> .
And what is this ?
<unk> : <unk> .
( Laughter ) And if you &apos;re not true ?
It makes a very simple thing to do , to give a message or a video that can give a message or a video that can be translated on Facebook after that .
The average <unk> has a thousand memories .
It &apos;s going to allow the Internet to be online , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and a video of that , you know , they &apos;re going to be more likely to die .
But you can look at everything .
A lot of you , you know , you know , you &apos;ve heard about <unk> Roy , who is in the 1930s , as he gets older than a half hours of <unk> videos .
I think , with the ability to be able to understand the physical language of the physical language and the <unk> of the data , the ability to change the information that is possible for all the whole life — the <unk> , the <unk> , the video , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And I think , as soon as it is , for our <unk> , it &apos;s going to be going to be going to take the end of the conversation with the <unk> of our deaths from our deaths , because we have to be able to make sure that we &apos;ve created , and the technology of technology is that we &apos;ve created , and the technology of technology gives it meaning .
Now we &apos;re going to run a couple of <unk> .
There &apos;s such an ally — I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> , and this is what you &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be able to write next .
So as you can see , you can see that it can be a <unk> .
Imagine if you look at something like five , 10 or 20 years or 20 years old .
It &apos;s going to take a step back , and it &apos;s going to work on a pedestal , and that &apos;s how people are capable of .
And if they were able to be able to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the hundreds of thousands of people who have created a whole life .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> in the United States , in the U.S. in 2008 , when CNN <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What if we could use this technology for the <unk> of our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who they &apos;ve created ?
Now , I think that it &apos;s completely possible that it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s going to be able to take data on the data , and it &apos;s a data that &apos;s going to be able to be able to put them on the <unk> .
As a result , I think we &apos;re going to look at it , or we &apos;re going to ask , &quot; &quot; Are we going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And if this is what it &apos;s going to be for the life of life and what &apos;s going on .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You &apos;re going to have heard of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first one is from <unk> <unk> .
The other <unk> is from the <unk> <unk> .
We really understand more about changing reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer these questions .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
You want to understand what you want to understand .
And then you can do that .
In fact , we have to be able to run out of the Universe of the Universe .
And so these systems are <unk> , and these systems are <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , this is what this means is that these systems are called <unk> <unk> .
What are we going to know ?
Now , as a consequence of a <unk> behavior , it &apos;s like a <unk> behavior .
and try to understand the system , and try to understand the system , and try to understand the system , and try to understand the system , that &apos;s what we do .
<unk> this system .
<unk> , literally , a system that doesn &apos;t exist .
It &apos;s the infrastructure that you have to do , and that &apos;s the motor of the network .
But why not ?
Where is the electric system ?
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
You can see that nobody had ever seen before watching .
&quot; How are they ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Are they <unk> ? &quot;
Or <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s the companies that work with more than one <unk> , and there are about 43,000 .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
At that time , 75 percent of all of all of them are <unk> .
We are in the middle of the lab .
But they &apos;re about 95 percent of the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
But the answer to the question is , who &apos;s going to ask a question about who ?
They make other things like that .
<unk> through <unk> .
And this is the same thing with a <unk> grid .
And these are the principles of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Well , I want to tell you , I want to focus on what I &apos;m talking about is what we &apos;re talking about .
In fact , if we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but if I imagine that I &apos;m going to see this puzzle , it &apos;s like this guy , he &apos;s going to see the whole thing , he &apos;s going to look at the <unk> , and he &apos;s going to be able to do it as a person , and he goes back to the <unk> .
And I imagine that this is because it &apos;s not a <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s happening with us without our own .
I &apos;m going to <unk> and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;m going to tell you what I mean by thinking , I &apos;m going to focus on life .
And I would like to tell you , and I &apos;d like to argue that a lot of the things that we &apos;re going to do is , maybe a lot of the things we &apos;re going to do , maybe even a lot of them — have a problem .
So love , we <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We are stagnating .
<unk> makes us crazy , and it makes us <unk> .
<unk> the hearts of the hearts and then the <unk> .
So , our <unk> is going to be remembered in somebody &apos;s sexual discrimination or <unk> .
( Laughter ) Yeah .
And they <unk> us as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you &apos;re going to measure the exact same thing in the <unk> — ( Laughter ) you see that it means and it means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Being &quot; &quot; is that you see that it means and &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in a very , <unk> <unk> , with a <unk> .
Only at the same time , there &apos;s been 16 <unk> on the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the <unk> <unk> of God .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to do the same words to try to get a little bit of the love that you want . ( Laughter )
<unk> ?
So what happened ?
How are we going to be able to get rid of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> ?
And why do we talk about this as a kind of positive experience , how did we go ?
That &apos;s the hardest thing , but I have a few <unk> .
And so that &apos;s what I want to do , I want to take a look at the <unk> , which is loving love as crazy .
When I first started to explore the love of love , I &apos;m going to get these crazy things about crazy everywhere .
The story of the culture of the <unk> culture that is going to be inspired by love <unk> .
Here &apos;s a few examples .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; is just a crazy thing to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There &apos;s always a lone nut going on .
&quot; &quot; <unk> on me , &quot; &quot; <unk> , so I &apos;m going to get rid of the <unk> <unk> — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to go back 20 years , and that was pretty much good at the beginning .
And these were the kinds of relationships for me to be able to look at the first few years , because it was very low for me .
I remember one moment .
I &apos;m going to go on a bed in a hotel in the middle of the United States , and I snuck in , like my brother .
It was <unk> , and it was almost <unk> , and we went to our apartment , and it &apos;s going to be able to bring back into our apartment , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
I don &apos;t remember what I &apos;m going to remember about , and I &apos;m very disappointed to remember that I was going to remember it .
I was 22 , and that was the first thing I had in my mind was , and I was one .
So I got home to my hometown home , and I knew the name of the city , which is the name of the city , and the name of the city , which I had to do was to get a little bit of it , and I wasn &apos;t going to be able to panic .
I didn &apos;t have a lot of money , and I had no money , and I didn &apos;t know .
I had a lot more excited for me to do this as a moment , but I &apos;m going to panic .
I &apos;m just going to do it .
And then the <unk> .
But although I got a little bit of a little voice in my head , a little voice in my head , like , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It was a <unk> .
I &apos;m really going to change the way . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because the ultimate part of my experience is the experience of self in <unk> .
Now it sounds so weird to me , but in 22 years old , I was going to have a <unk> <unk> , and at that moment I was a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and that &apos;s pretty weird , but I thought that this was really exciting , but I thought that this was really exciting , but I thought that this was really exciting , but I thought that this was kind of exciting , but I thought that I was going to walk .
I think , at the same level , I &apos;m going to be able to be <unk> <unk> , because I thought it was like a love and works .
It &apos;s not supposed to be a <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t have to be <unk> , you know , there &apos;s eight <unk> , 14 songs , two letters , two and a <unk> called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; of Love .
We <unk> .
That &apos;s the real thing . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that my first love is going to be like crazy .
But somebody in this way , as if my grandfather was completely disconnected from the <unk> <unk> — wasn &apos;t very good for me .
But I think that this kind of <unk> is not very good .
Most of us have a little bit of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , there &apos;s a belief that is that , you know , you know , that &apos;s what it is , because it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s not so easy .
It &apos;s really true .
It &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , so you can see that the crime rate is very similar to the intersection of people in a very similar way to <unk> people with the <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , the average rate is also emerging from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a few more people that love to be able to do this with a little bit of our <unk> and <unk> .
And other people , <unk> , is that most of it is in this way .
<unk> <unk> , which is that the average rate of <unk> <unk> is a reminder of what a sense of feeling as somebody else is in their head .
And most of us , when we first hit the first time .
It &apos;s usually from several months to several years .
When I came back from my trip to my trip , I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my bedroom in my bedroom .
I decided that when my friends couldn &apos;t understand my own mountain mountain , I was going to take them away .
So I &apos;m going to run out of those of them .
It was probably the same year in my life .
But I think I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to be angry , because I was my job , because if I was a coward , then I would be able to shake it as much as I am .
And if I &apos;m going to do that , then we would end up with all of these things , and then we would end up with it .
It &apos;s not a lone nut , because it &apos;s not there , it &apos;s not there to be a <unk> rule that a lot of people are going to have , but we &apos;re talking about love like this .
Our experiences and <unk> and <unk> .
Our <unk> says that love is a good thing , and it &apos;s a good thing to do , and it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s a good thing to do , and it doesn &apos;t mean that your mouth is going to be like , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s going to be a good thing if you &apos;re going to get wet .
Well , in fact , you &apos;ve heard about this — you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , our culture is a very different culture to try and make it happy about love .
So this is what we &apos;re talking about in this particular way , and they &apos;re mad and crazy .
It &apos;s a pretty interesting thing to do .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , and we &apos;re going to take it through our minds and the stories , but then we think of our story and the stories of the story , and then we think of our stories , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Interestingly , this is what &apos;s happening in a culture that &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
And we &apos;re crazy and crazy and crazy , and we want it to improve the whole life .
It &apos;s cute .
( Laughter ) To do that , we need to change our culture , or change our culture .
Imagine that we were all less likely to be less <unk> .
If we were more inclined to be more optimistic , more <unk> , more <unk> , and if we should be willing to get better , we would be in it .
I know that it requires a lot of things , but I &apos;m not the first person to do it .
The book is , &quot; &quot; The Book of <unk> , &quot; &quot; which we live in &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and George <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; of this <unk> solution .
They are <unk> , and even more likely to be judged by our <unk> , as the ones that are <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> a new <unk> for <unk> : <unk> as a <unk> .
I &apos;m really going to love that way .
They say , &quot; &quot; Well , what you &apos;re saying is , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do , and there &apos;s a way to look at all of the other things , or the ideas that are going to occur in the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> are all the things that you see on the top of the drama of art , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And these ideas are good at all kinds of things that are good at the beginning of the clinical care , and they also work with other things , and they also work with others , and they also work with other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So if you &apos;re going to love it , it &apos;s a great curiosity that &apos;s going to love the truth of the love of the love .
<unk> <unk> , ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ You need <unk> and <unk> .
And the love is one of the things that I &apos;m going to love .
You know , you know , all of your experiences in your experiences .
When I was a coward , I never imagined that I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do anything that was going on .
When the teacher would open up for the first time , if you had a <unk> , you couldn &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a few four days in which she had four days ago .
Where is it ?
It &apos;s going to be exhausting .
Right ?
And as a coward , you know , we &apos;re going to have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> , he <unk> , it &apos;s just <unk> .
I mean , I understand that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but if I was reading this <unk> , it was also in 14 years old , and that was the meaning for me .
Love is just something that I &apos;m going to share with you , and not what I &apos;m going to do with me without what I &apos;m going to do with me , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do that with me without my niece , or I &apos;m going to be able to do it .
But it &apos;s still hard .
<unk> <unk> sometimes and <unk> , and when I feel like myself , I should be wondering : My job in this relationship is to talk to my partners that I want to do with my partners that I want to do .
It &apos;s also <unk> .
But that &apos;s a lot better than the other person , which is a lone nut .
It &apos;s not about <unk> or <unk> .
Instead of doing that , it needs to be a <unk> partner , and if it becomes difficult , it becomes difficult , and it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Because you &apos;ve got to stop thinking about yourself and thinking about yourself and thinking about it , and we start to think about what you &apos;re going to do .
And that one of the things that we give us is something like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not really good at all .
Or , &quot; &quot; Well , these kinds of relationships that I &apos;m passionate about , but it was that it was great . &quot; &quot; The good thing is that it &apos;s great .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to have to decide how it &apos;s going to look .
Thank you .
( Applause )
And I was also going to be able to go back to the New York City trip to my hometown , which is that in the &apos; 90s , I was like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry for the city , &quot; &quot; in the city , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , as if you &apos;re going to go , you &apos;re not going to go through the <unk> , a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I went to the <unk> , and I was wondering what I was going to do , and I wondered what I was going to have to do with me .
&quot; &quot; What is it for ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is that ?
Her eyes on his forehead .
And you know , you know , it &apos;s very common that the software has a very common thing to do right now .
( Laughter ) And so I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to go , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do is , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then she sat down on me for a couple of years , and then I &apos;m going to go back and forth , because she wakes up on me .
I am .
( Laughter ) So this is one of the <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
So in the last five years , I think a lot of things about this is why sometimes we have a tendency to understand ourselves , and how we look at ourselves , when we look at ourselves , and what we &apos;re going to do is , when we look at the action , and what we &apos;re going to understand about the human being .
I mean , I &apos;ve been in the last five years , I &apos;ve been diagnosed for the last five years .
My choice , I &apos;m going to share a career , and a lot of the things that you can do , but it &apos;s a big thing to do : the right competition on the ground .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us would be freed from the process of thinking about how you &apos;re thinking , if you don &apos;t want to think about the opportunity of your <unk> .
We understand it .
We understand that sometimes every single thing in that room .
We are people , we are <unk> <unk> . Okay .
But if on the right side of me , this time , I &apos;m going to spend this time in this time , all the sudden , all the sudden , all of the sudden , the human psyche of the human psyche , and I couldn &apos;t imagine what was going on .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this place that we live in .
And we have a <unk> on the <unk> , and they have the same <unk> on the table , and they have the same <unk> .
To do that , you know , we &apos;re all going through a whole life of belief that we &apos;re always going to be right now .
I &apos;m going to challenge the challenge .
And I think this is a problem that every single one of us , on a personal level , or a certain level of a society .
And what I &apos;m going to do today is that we &apos;re going to be <unk> today , because we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Secondly , that &apos;s why it works .
And what I want you to do is I want you to imagine that it &apos;s possible to be able to walk out of the <unk> <unk> , and when you look at it , it &apos;s the best of all kinds of different things in the world , and that &apos;s what you can do .
So why are we going to be able to get into our <unk> ?
And one of the things that is done with the <unk> <unk> .
Let &apos;s give you a <unk> , you know , because you &apos;re there , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> ?
<unk> . <unk> .
<unk> . Good luck .
<unk> , from <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and they are all the answers , and they &apos;re responding to another question .
You &apos;re wondering , &quot; &quot; What do you want to do is , &quot; &quot; What do you do is , &quot; &quot; What do you do . &quot;
( Laughter ) The <unk> <unk> <unk> that makes sense of experience , and yet a whole bunch of things don &apos;t ?
For example , you can have a sense of feeling , if you think of it , if you think of it , if you don &apos;t have a sense of feeling , if you don &apos;t have a sense of feeling , you don &apos;t even feel good .
But the rule is no longer a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
You know , it &apos;s almost that in every single one of that , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do with the <unk> , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to look at , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do .
But every time you get to the rocks of the rocks are at the same time .
What it is , especially when you &apos;re only six years old , is what it is , for example .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s not going to be a <unk> , and you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
So that &apos;s what he &apos;s going to do .
When we do something , it &apos;s not when we realize that we &apos;re going to look at that , and yes , we &apos;re going to go back to the <unk> and the rocks and the rocks of the <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to do that , we &apos;re going to be able to do that , but we can still feel confident on the ground .
I &apos;m going to have to worry about what I said .
There &apos;s a sense of the <unk> , the sense of parenting .
( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the <unk> <unk> of our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> this <unk> .
You know , we don &apos;t have an <unk> , and we don &apos;t have a <unk> , if we don &apos;t .
There &apos;s also another reason why we &apos;re going to get to this <unk> , and it &apos;s more innovative .
Imagine a <unk> school .
You &apos;re going to be <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have a <unk> .
In fact , that &apos;s not my May .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in your school , and you do know that we &apos;ve got to think about what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s <unk> , and he never does it .
So again , you &apos;ve learned that you &apos;ve learned that , you know , you &apos;ve learned that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have to be successful in life , you &apos;re never going to be a <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> .
Most of us , and I think , in fact , particularly in this room , is that it &apos;s been treated by the new <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Do you don &apos;t , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s the same thing , is it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s great ?
( Laughter ) So , you know , you &apos;re all these things , and you &apos;re all kinds of stuff , and you &apos;re going to go .
It will be .
It &apos;s only when we realize that we may be able to figure out that we might be able to figure out what we might be .
Because that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , when we make our <unk> , we know that something is wrong with us .
So we &apos;re going to focus on their own , because we feel like we feel <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Let me tell you about an accident .
A few years ago , a hospital &apos;s name for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This hospital lies in the hospital .
It &apos;s called the <unk> <unk> students , and he &apos;s one of the things that he has in this room .
There are women in the room and they &apos;re going to go into the room .
It was clinging to the <unk> , and he &apos;s going to be able to put it in front of her , and then he got her back to her house .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and he says , &quot; &quot; Why am I going to do not look at the hell ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I going to do not look at this ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to do that ? &quot;
When you &apos;re talking about this kind of <unk> , he said something very different .
&quot; &quot; In fact , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So why I &apos;m talking about this , because it &apos;s been working on a <unk> basis . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So why I &apos;m talking about this , because what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , you &apos;re going to have to believe that you &apos;re going to be able to do that .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we all know about , and it &apos;s not as good as it is , but it &apos;s true that it &apos;s true in the world .
And if we &apos;re in our own <unk> , we don &apos;t even think of the ability to do our own , and we do not think about the opportunity of the <unk> million <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a solvable problem for a <unk> .
But it &apos;s also a challenge for society .
<unk> on <unk> , what &apos;s the feeling of my mind .
This is what your mind is , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s a <unk> problem , which is the most important thing that people are doing .
And that &apos;s what most of us do for us to do with other people with the other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first thing that we usually think when somebody else is going to be , is that they don &apos;t have a good question .
They just don &apos;t have access to the information that you have , and when you get that information out of it , we &apos;re going to get them out of it , and they &apos;re going to look at it .
Now , if that &apos;s not the case , when we look at what they &apos;re going to do with us , we don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do with us , but we don &apos;t know that we &apos;re going to go on the other side of the <unk> — that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
( Laughter ) Before they &apos;ve got to do all of them , they need to be <unk> , and they don &apos;t have it .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , if we realize that the people that we don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t want to be compassionate , we &apos;re going to know the truth , but they &apos;re pretty good , we &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> — they know the truth , but for their own <unk> , we know the truth , but for their own <unk> , we know .
It &apos;s a disaster .
It doesn &apos;t give us a little bit of what you don &apos;t need to do , but it doesn &apos;t give us any mistakes , especially when it &apos;s going to be to each other .
And I think it &apos;s more for me , and I think that I think that this is something that was completely disconnected from our human human being .
<unk> , we want to believe that our <unk> is the kind of thing to believe that we &apos;re going to be able to see that we &apos;re going to be able to see that we can see that we can see that we can see what we &apos;re going to do , and what we &apos;re going to do is exactly what we can see .
And what we want to do is to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to make sure that we have seen the exact same thing .
This is the same thing , and if it was , it would be incredibly exciting .
We don &apos;t realize that we can see the light that it is .
It &apos;s what we can see .
We can have a tendency to think about the future , and we can imagine ourselves as other people in other places .
And it &apos;s because everybody else is going to see where we are going to look at the most <unk> sky and see it , and that &apos;s what it is .
And that &apos;s why we are .
In the next 10 years , it &apos;s like a <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; wrote &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
Now , grandpa realized that the fact that our <unk> is not a <unk> system , it &apos;s not a <unk> system , it &apos;s not something for the <unk> or the <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Because we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know that in this world .
<unk> from other animals , we try to try this light .
And I think that this is a good thing to do , and it &apos;s the <unk> and the <unk> of our grandparents .
<unk> , in different ways , I started to listen to a lot of <unk> program , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> life . &quot;
I mean , listen , I &apos;m listening , and I &apos;m going to experience the experience that all of them is about <unk> .
At first I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m always going to be crazy , and you can see it .
It seems to me everywhere .
But after how many months I &apos;ve ever had this opportunity to be able to participate in a <unk> program .
I &apos;m going to do this with me , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s exactly what .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not even what it is , you know , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> program .
It was like , &quot; &quot; I thought it would be something that you do , and it &apos;s actually going to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is , &quot; &quot; which is the kind of thing that we do .
We &apos;re going to need a lot of stuff that we need to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I mean , the other thing that &apos;s going on is that we &apos;re going to be compassionate .
But you know , you know , we are more important , because our whole life .
We think it &apos;s going to be true .
George W. Bush thought that the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it really happened to happen .
Also , the <unk> Mubarak thought that I was going to be able to make sure that the rest of his life until the rest of his life , as opposed to <unk> , and then , by the course of the <unk> <unk> son .
And it really happened to happen .
And you &apos;ve been wondering , and you &apos;ve been thinking , well , you &apos;ve got to think about that , and you &apos;ve got to be able to be able to come out of school with a lot of people who are going to be able to look at a lot of things together .
And it really happened to happen .
I have to admit that I &apos;m going to tell you that I write a book about something , which is something that doesn &apos;t exist , for example , it &apos;s never going to be wrong .
And it really happened to happen .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s life .
We <unk> the <unk> ideas of the world , which is the best thing to do — to the better force , is not . And the light is not .
It &apos;s not a <unk> , but the whole thing is , it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> .
So we <unk> a whole bunch of pieces of innovation about innovation , and it &apos;s going to be , but you know , why are we going to need this innovation , and that &apos;s what we need ?
Because of course , half the ideas that have been crazy , and we have the ability to change the light — the <unk> at TED , what &apos;s going on there .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t smoke , or anything ? ( Laughter )
Where are my <unk> ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we &apos;re again here .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> .
We put another idea .
We <unk> another story .
We &apos;re going to take the same thing .
<unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ve heard about seven million times , is like a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , if you &apos;re really going to want to be able to do this , you &apos;re going to be able to look at the enormity of the pyramid , and that is beyond the outside of the pyramid , and the <unk> of the Universe and the <unk> of the Universe and saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I am . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) <unk> <unk> . ( Applause )
Five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At the first time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but by the way , <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Well , fortunately , these plans were caused by the FBI by the FBI .
But I &apos;m sorry to say , you know , I &apos;m going to have a Ph.D. at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
As a result , there &apos;s a lot of people called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> — my father .
I was born in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
But when I got seven years old , I was born in our family .
My father showed me that a little bit of a young man who is a little girl who &apos;s going to see , including most of Muslims .
So my experience shows that when people take one of each other , they spend a lot of time to understand what we &apos;re going to do to understand what we want to do .
But in fact , in every instance , we have a little bit of people who are going to have a little bit of people who are going to be able to make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to make sure that they can make them better in order to make others live .
And in a few months , I had a great father of my father , and I told you that a few years ago , he said to my friends in Long Beach , <unk> <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do this with me .
We &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the FBI .
And that day , my last brother in a small <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s especially my own , but most of my sudden , I &apos;ve had a lot of <unk> .
My brother and I said to her friends , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the father , that &apos;s why the son .
And it was really hard for all of that , but just for a few years , I realized that it was completely different .
They had seen me as a result of my father .
As a result of these people , we &apos;ve got these people called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These were men that I &apos;m going to do .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means .
I grew up in the middle of 20 times , and that &apos;s my childhood , I had the opportunity to give me the possibility of friends .
Every time I begin to experience myself in one room , an hour of an hour and a half an hour and a friend of mine .
I &apos;m always going to spend a new class in the classroom , and I &apos;ve been educated .
I &apos;m going to be able to do my work in the wrong way , and I don &apos;t want to get rid of the attention , but as a parent , for a new child , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , in the classroom , I &apos;m going to be able
I &apos;m going to play with a video game .
And that &apos;s what my social skill skills were , and I think that my social skill , I think , is not the best part of the life .
I was inspired by the people on the top of the <unk> <unk> , as opposed to race or race .
What is my eyes ?
The first thing that we &apos;ve done is we have the original idea of this mysterious mindset , that happened during the year <unk> <unk> .
And I was able to do this for a while , and I was able to run with a team called <unk> <unk> .
I had a group of violent violence .
Members of our groups are the most different layers of society .
And one day , I learned to the end of my life , and one of my new friends was mesmerized .
Because this is just a few days ago , a few days ago , <unk> <unk> .
I had never had a friend of mine , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to be able to see that I &apos;m going to be able to make sure that I &apos;m going to spend a lot of my life .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> was born in <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to bring people most of the world &apos;s lives and the crops , and that experiences that are fundamental in my personality .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ends ) ( Applause )
So as a coward , I had the opportunity to be able to be able to be able to do this , and I &apos;m going to show you how many of them were , and I quickly realized that many of them were going to be more powerful , and I quickly found that many of them were the ones that were going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , in the checklisted childhood , who has a sense of pleasure in the checklisted childhood , and for me , to give me a sense of other good people , and for me , I don &apos;t want to make sure that I &apos;m going to get to me .
It &apos;s the feeling that I &apos;m going to get into my childhood <unk> , which I was born in a kid with a <unk> .
I &apos;ve been wondering how it is to be a <unk> .
And then there was &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and every <unk> John <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to tell that race , whether it &apos;s a parent or a <unk> , and I understood that race , a woman or a <unk> , has nothing to do with an individual personality .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> that I &apos;m going to have in a lot of time in which I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
<unk> are often going to come out , and I &apos;m pretty good at that , I know that I &apos;m going to know that I &apos;m going to know that I &apos;m going to have a lot more wrong than my <unk> .
And one day , I was talking to my mother , and she told me that I was going to be compassionate in the hearts of my life .
And so I looked at my eyes , and I looked at my eyes , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a lot of people . &quot;
At this point , I realized how much of the energy of energy is going to make this happen in order to make this happen .
Zack <unk> is not my name .
I <unk> him when I was my family , and I decided to start a new life .
So I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I &apos;m going to do , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m doing this in a belief that somebody who has an opportunity for me to tell you that somebody has a little bit of a story , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a better thing to do with that . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> .
Instead , I &apos;m going to share my experiences in the midst of the Classics , the <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m doing this for a lot of fun , and for them , for the lack of pain , and the ones that are exposed to their own share of the <unk> .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to talk about in my parents .
I &apos;m a family here , because the violence is not the best part of the race or the race , and that my son is not going to follow the path of his parents .
I wasn &apos;t my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
Or can it be a few of that may be a little bit of a way of thinking about that , or even a parent .
It &apos;s not the best for another .
You can help to make a lot of a lot less <unk> .
When I was a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to panic .
&quot; &quot; When my brother , &quot; &quot; where my brother and I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; in my head , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause )
Now , I &apos;ve spent the United States of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t exist .
So you can see that , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to tell a difference .
But it can &apos;t be .
Now , if you think about good luck , but it seems to be a thought .
It &apos;s an hour , and so forth .
<unk> , a career , a career that will allow you to allow you to afford to give you a <unk> , <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> .
When you look at the <unk> .
And you &apos;ve created a <unk> for yourself .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I &apos;m the one who love <unk> <unk> .
When we look at it as a matter of self .
You &apos;re going to do that same thing .
Some years ago , I decided to take a trip , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Morgan <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be able to go through these <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> months , an hour became a lot more <unk> .
This picture of my niece , when I was doing it all day every day .
I &apos;m never going to be <unk> .
I also <unk> .
In fact , <unk> <unk> is not to go to bed .
It &apos;s hard , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to run through the <unk> . &quot;
Don &apos;t , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go . &quot;
And I realized that when I was doing that , I thought , I think , when I was doing this , I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to look at it , and I &apos;m going to look at it , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it .
In fact , they <unk> .
( Applause )
I &apos;m incredibly passionate about the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the world in order to be <unk> .
In 1975 , when I was seven and a half a year in the women in the world .
So that day , they didn &apos;t work , whether or not , or have a special place , or not just a <unk> .
They came from <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 90 percent of women , and they asked them to come back .
It wasn &apos;t working in this day , because it doesn &apos;t work if women don &apos;t work .
( Applause ) A year for five years , the <unk> had to be the first place in the world , which was the first one in the world , which is a <unk> .
I &apos;m never going to forget that day when I was sitting in the front of the day , I was going to go on the balcony of my house , and it &apos;s going to be on the balcony of my house , and it &apos;s going to be on the balcony .
( Applause ) And it became a <unk> <unk> for me , for me and every one of the people who grew up in that hour , including <unk> .
So she said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;ve got to see a story about a character that is going to take her back to her and said , &quot; &quot; What can you do ? &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; Is it going to be possible if you &apos;re born ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the underlying model is actually a matter , but even with the skills of the powerful , but even with the skills of the <unk> , I was like , &quot; &quot; Who are I going
Who am I going to do to be brave ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , women are less likely to be more aggressive than men .
<unk> , in the United States , in 2011 , that was that 62 percent of the men who were diagnosed with their <unk> <unk> , but only 45 percent of women .
We &apos;re going to look at 16 percent , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to see in 16 percent .
It &apos;s a real good thing , because I believe that the world is going to be more inclusive and more inclusive leadership .
So my solution is that I &apos;m going to have a solution to the notion that I &apos;m going to make my own <unk> , even without the <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ll try to take that out of the face of the world that &apos;s going to take the meaning of the world that &apos;s going to make sense of the meaning of the world that &apos;s going to have the meaning and the courage to do what they want .
It was a trip to my life .
It was wonderful .
<unk> started with 20 <unk> .
And then after 9 / 11 , after 9 / 11 , and I ended up going up with us , three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the whole story .
<unk> , you know , you know , there &apos;s a drama in the United States , but I can say — ( Laughter ) — I can tell you that we are in the middle of the world .
First of the last 20 years , the last 20 years , the first 20 years , it &apos;s not a <unk> , it &apos;s possible , it &apos;s based on that .
And then he <unk> , if our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , he had his family and his family .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because of the people who are willing to be arrested .
And in a few days of the subject of his family and her family and her family , and he was also a <unk> , and he said again .
Now , as an outsider , it is what it does , because there are two people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to become a <unk> <unk> .
So 9 / 11 , for 45 days , I &apos;m not very good at all .
I don &apos;t even have a place in the <unk> .
I had one percent , and I had one percent , but it was a little bit of it , and it was a <unk> <unk> .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to tell you that I &apos;ve got to put all the stuff in order to get my own place in order to get my own place for me , and I &apos;m going to go back and forth , because it was only two and a half percent of the voices of the voice in the first <unk> .
Now , these days of these <unk> , I would argue that I &apos;m going to be able to be there with three men , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what it &apos;s going to be a 2.5 percent , a couple of percent .
( Applause )
The biggest problem that we &apos;ve got to do with this is that we had to be connected to the <unk> , and it &apos;s been connected .
<unk> .
Some argue that the floor of my life is a <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> .
You can &apos;t <unk> .
I &apos;ve been fascinated with a lot of access to access , and it &apos;s an hour of media .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I mean , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to be able to do it in 87 times for a few months before , before I was in front of an hour .
And I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to argue that the reason that the reason is that the reason that I &apos;m going to do is because the media in the media , in the media , is in the media , and you have to focus on that , you know , we &apos;re going to start thinking .
When I had access to TB , the first question is , &quot; &quot; Are you kidding me ? &quot; &quot; And that was the question .
<unk> , from 1 to two and a half percent of the voice that you can understand .
But the media is really important , and every time I &apos;ve been involved in TB , we &apos;ve seen and felt that I was born in TB , because I know it &apos;s important , and why we have to focus on that .
I had a friend of mine who had never been invited to interview the first day .
I was going to be more interested in the question that the rest of the rest of the rest of the world , and outside of the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to do that , but I &apos;m going to give you a visual media .
It wasn &apos;t almost any of my favorites .
( Applause ) It &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
But there &apos;s another very important experience .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> , without the <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
It has these kinds of experiences and access to the resources , perhaps the ability to harness our companies , but also to do it differently .
Our company was <unk> , and we would probably change the tone for others .
Mo in this cause is due to TB , because I wanted to show you something else .
And if you have access to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> information .
I &apos;m going to run on Facebook for Facebook , at Facebook , and I &apos;m going to put a message on Facebook .
All right , all sorts of questions together , and we &apos;re going to put on Facebook and Facebook access to Facebook , because we believed in <unk> <unk> when the <unk> <unk> .
When it turned out to be a <unk> stranger , I started using <unk> .
<unk> <unk> me , how do you do it , and I &apos;m going to take everyone in my lab at the same time .
I really had a lot of <unk> and <unk> , because I &apos;m going to go .
But because of that , we have increased the numbers of <unk> in the world .
<unk> , you might be able to lead a company and a way .
I &apos;m sorry to tell you , I &apos;m sorry to talk about a lot of money .
And that &apos;s what it is , but it &apos;s true , and we were less educated of our resources than other people .
<unk> , the reason for partly was that , in my view , it was a little bit of an hour , so I think it was a bit of an ally .
And maybe I &apos;m going to do more with a little bit of <unk> .
Some say that this is a very good thing .
But even with the media , even from the media and the <unk> , it &apos;s only from the media , and we &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a whole bunch of people on a daily basis , when you get the first numbers .
I &apos;m going to touch myself as you can see in the <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , the original data , I was going to go with the <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Well , I wound up the wound , because I &apos;m not going to be able to come up with the <unk> , but I took another place , and we ended up dragging the way back from each other to almost <unk> pieces of voice , which was 10 percent of the voices of the past .
There &apos;s a few of these pictures of me that have been inspired by me and a lot of people , and lots of people made me quiet .
But in fact , I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to be able to make sure that I &apos;m going to be able to get more <unk> on the side of the road , and a huge number of people I &apos;ve ever seen in 2040 .
( Applause ) Now , she &apos;s got 13 , and she never had surgery .
But in the afternoon , I was crying for her in TB , and she was <unk> , and she was <unk> , and her mother &apos;s mother .
<unk> , it was <unk> my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 16 years old , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
This is a picture for me .
We can do everything we can do .
Yes , fear and problem .
( Applause ) Now , you need to go , and it &apos;s an hour of women &apos;s time , and it &apos;s an hour of women &apos;s time , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
I &apos;m also going to be able to go through the New Yorker &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;ve got to do a new <unk> : &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , this is my favorite one , because women too often have a lot of women too often , because women are too often , and I know that we &apos;re just going to do that .
( Applause ) And we have to use that .
It &apos;s a day that we had a <unk> , like , because we felt .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
We need to go to that , and you , your family , I &apos;m friends , everybody who &apos;s going to work with you , if you &apos;re going to get good , you know , you &apos;re going to have a lot of people who are going to work with you .
We &apos;ve been good at the time , and I &apos;ve been wondering why I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time in this journey , more than I can tell you at the time .
But it was a big thing , it was the same thing .
I wasn &apos;t sleeping .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , and I realized that I knew a lot of what I knew was a day , and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re only going to do that in a moment , when you put yourself in your mind , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re going to do that , you &apos;re going to have a conversation with it .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh , a good thing , a good curiosity , you &apos;re going to <unk> your <unk> , but you &apos;re never going to give you away .
I want to give you a lot of stuff , and you all know that any individual of your individual is your team .
People are going to look at the value of the value and zeros , but it &apos;s going to be true .
For me , it &apos;s a single thing that I &apos;m going to do , I &apos;m an amazing curiosity that I &apos;m talking about here today , with a family — ( Applause ) and <unk> with my friends , we &apos;re going to look at something like this , in the words of the <unk> and the <unk> .
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , what I &apos;m going to do is tell you how good I &apos;m going to do when I was seven percent .
I &apos;m going to measure it , because maybe it &apos;s been true , and it &apos;s going to be true , and it &apos;s going to take it to the <unk> .
But at one point , I decided to tell you that he &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
It &apos;s an incredibly important thing , because I actually have a very small sleep , and it worked with me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to do a lot if we &apos;re going to be able to do a lot when we &apos;re going .
I think it &apos;s really important to me , and it &apos;s really important to me , and it &apos;s really important , and it &apos;s not less important if you don &apos;t have any more , but it &apos;s not less important if you don &apos;t have any more , you know , it &apos;s going to be more important if you don &apos;t have any more , you know , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
Now , this has been completely different , and I decided not to focus on my attention , and I &apos;m not going to be able to focus on the <unk> , partly because of my power .
And when I was a <unk> at a moment — and this is an hour of the hour , and it was an hour of the time , because it was a <unk> , I &apos;m not just doing that , but I &apos;m not just as simple as my own .
I called our <unk> <unk> , where I call &quot; &quot; G &quot; &quot; means .
The first of them is , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m going to try and make sure that I was going to try and to be honest , and I wanted to encourage the leadership as a <unk> of our work during the company .
Another word is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or <unk> .
I decided to do that .
You could take a lot of , although it was a <unk> item .
And I &apos;m going to focus on all of these things , so that it &apos;s different .
<unk> words , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was a <unk> for everybody .
I had no idea , and I had no idea for Facebook or on Facebook .
I think I think you &apos;re going to take the answers to your questions .
<unk> is less important to the word that this room is not going to be in this room , we &apos;re going to be able to run a company called <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> ) And I &apos;m so excited , I &apos;m so excited about it , to make sure that it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be done in many ways .
I can &apos;t tell you that it was simple , but I think I &apos;m going to be honest , and I think that &apos;s my team , and I think it was a good thing .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not going to give you anything . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now , I can &apos;t tell you that I &apos;m not going to get you wrong , I &apos;m not going to panic .
I mean , maybe everyone in this room is willing to be able to do the same thing , and it &apos;s going to be in the room .
We are hardly likely to be able to be able to get a voice in there , but there is something that we can do about it , but there is something that we can do in the world , and there is something we can do with it .
I mean , I mean , you know , a long old way to remember a 1975 , if women were born in the street , and it really became a little bit of <unk> in the street , and it really became an outsider .
You &apos;re going to look at it before , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do before , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , you know , it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
And you can know , you can know , because of the media , the media isn &apos;t going to look at this , but in the middle of the village , women are going to go on the street . Right ?
DH : Yeah . PM : What do we tell us about this ?
<unk> : 41 years from now , we can create a <unk> place in the world to be brave , but we &apos;re going to serve our work in the world , but our work is <unk> .
So , in the hospital , they have women who have a great job , because for that time , they &apos;re going to take their <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) So what I did was that was the fact that I was going to be able to do that , and I was going to be able to see that there was a <unk> and a black woman who was going to be able to do it before , because it &apos;s an hour of an hour .
PM : Well , I &apos;m not going to give you a little bit of what I &apos;m going to do , but I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to have a big idea of it , but I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be able to do it again .
Thank you .
<unk> : Thank you very much .
( Applause )
In fact , I &apos;ve been trying to think about my career , my career , and the best example I have to think about my career , and the best example I &apos;m going to do is New Yorker a couple of years ago .
<unk> <unk> , looking at <unk> , says , &quot; &quot; Oh , Dad , when I grow up , I want to be brave . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to bring a lot of stuff that people in the world have seen , because I have access to access that people in the world have ever seen people around the world .
I &apos;m not going to spend 50 degrees in America , but we &apos;re going to have a wife and a lot more on the world .
We &apos;re not just going to be <unk> or <unk> , but also , we &apos;re not just going to be <unk> or <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to live in the most marginalized societies .
It &apos;s the most powerful human being , and knowing the world as well as I know , I can tell you , I can tell you that I can tell you that I can tell you with no idea , and I can tell you that this is the violence of women &apos;s eyes , and that &apos;s the violence of women .
There &apos;s a few different versions that I &apos;m going to do .
<unk> for all of this , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
They &apos;re going to be able to put them in order to claim that women are usually exposed to the dangers of men in the face of God .
So a few years ago , 2000 , I was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> for 70 years , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to go back to the Royal School of <unk> , &quot; &quot; which I &apos;m going to be able to do , and I &apos;m going to be able to do that in the middle school in the year 2000 , and I &apos;m going to see that I &apos;m also going to be <unk> , and I &apos;m going to ask the men .
So , they <unk> , which , by the course of the race , women will be a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , when the woman &apos;s sitting in the class in the middle of the <unk> , she can &apos;t be able to do it if you &apos;re sitting in a room , and so you can find out in the room , and so you can find out in the room , and you can find out in the room , and you can see that a woman is not going
But it &apos;s what it is , it &apos;s what it is , you know , it &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do to get men into a more <unk> .
It &apos;s a solvable problem , because men can serve the power , for example , when a parent or a parent or a parent or a parent .
So why should I be paid to do that at the end of the world ?
And that &apos;s what we know about this problem , which is that we &apos;ve got to think about violence .
In the United States , for example , we &apos;ve got to have an increased increase in <unk> <unk> , and the people who were going to be buried in the <unk> .
One of thousands of thousands of thousands of people are in the <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be able to get 1,000 .
It &apos;s about growing .
Since I left the house , I started growing up on 800 percent of the women &apos;s women in <unk> .
We are one of the things that we &apos;ve seen from the Earth , which I &apos;ve seen in May of May , with <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to place a place in one of the things that we see in the world that is the most powerful part of the world .
We are now in California , and I &apos;m going to spend the last day that I was going to spend four billion dollars on average , 13 , 13 <unk> .
<unk> man .
You know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s called a <unk> law , which is a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what we have to do with sexual humiliation , and that &apos;s what we have to do with violence , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with sexual violence on women .
I &apos;m going to be pretty disappointed .
You know , they are a <unk> <unk> .
But in a few countries , in many countries , in many countries , if there &apos;s a little bit of a girl who &apos;s born , it &apos;s going to be a little bit more likely to be able to do that , but in a few countries , if you &apos;re born , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> portion of the <unk> .
<unk> , more <unk> , <unk> <unk> , so you can see that a young woman can be able to do that .
And then when she was married , it was the same thing to be able to do sex with sex .
It &apos;s not a <unk> .
<unk> , for example , 91 to the 91 of all the women who live in the lab today , have been <unk> today .
And there &apos;s a few countries that are 98 percent of women &apos;s countries that are born so far .
This is the <unk> <unk> for all the women in the world .
The other one is a very , very good thing , which is where the family I was with , and there &apos;s nothing in the wrong thing , and that &apos;s what it was like to be a <unk> person with her family , and if she had a parent or a girl , even when she gets married or when she gets married , sometimes even when she gets married or when she had a parent or a girl , even when she gets married or when she gets married , sometimes even when she gets married
It happens to be a family of her family , and that &apos;s how I &apos;m going to get older when a young woman was born .
It wasn &apos;t as long as the <unk> test , and it showed that 75 percent of these women will be diagnosed with <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , 25 percent of the women &apos;s women .
The biggest problem that there are in the world in the world in women is slavery , or creative people , as it is called .
About seven million people were born in the Arab world , in 18 months .
30 million people live today in slavery today .
The United States of the United States has to be able to do every single year , and we have the <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s where every year , 80 percent of those sex workers are the women who are affected by female slavery .
In the United States , in the United States , it &apos;s about 60,000 people living under gender or slavery .
Atlanta , <unk> , where you &apos;re going to be able to have a <unk> , between 200 and 300 and 300 women .
It &apos;s a room for one of that .
There &apos;s also a lot of <unk> , too .
And if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s how they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , Wyoming .
So this is a very good thing , a very powerful problem , because you don &apos;t have to believe in America , but you don &apos;t have to be able to do it .
It &apos;s going to be a place to be one of the <unk> , the women and the rest of the world around the world .
There &apos;s a nice good approach to this .
15 years ago , they decided to change the law , and women are no longer known to the law when they were born in slavery , but they <unk> and <unk> , and — ( Applause ) — he went down to a decline .
United States .
On the other hand , there were 25 women in the United States .
Canada , <unk> , I &apos;ve already said , <unk> , <unk> and other countries .
This is another one that can be done .
We &apos;re going to have two big <unk> in our <unk> , our <unk> and <unk> systems .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which I received , says that there was a <unk> .
Only 3,000 , more than one <unk> , and the reason is that there is any organization in any organization called the <unk> , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of my law , and , of course , in the past , what they want to do is that they want them to do that they don &apos;t do that .
This law has to be exhausting .
It &apos;s going to be <unk> , and this is now a lot of <unk> , partly because of my book , but because of other things , it would be impossible to 89 in the United States of the United Nations , because the people who are empowered to protect them from domestic violence .
<unk> <unk> says , on the back of the campus , it &apos;s because of the existence of life , when they put someone , but when they put them on campus , and when they put them on campus .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
These are things that are going to happen in our <unk> .
You know , it &apos;s really bad , you know , the <unk> on the right in the <unk> that you know . ( Applause )
When I got the <unk> , the shift was 39 .
So we <unk> <unk> , and so forth — ( Applause ) — ( Applause ) — but in the past 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 hours in the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening now .
When you take 500 of them , they &apos;re going to have 23 companies , 500 , and these dragons , I &apos;m going to tell you that there are less less than the ones on the ground .
It &apos;s what &apos;s happening in our <unk> .
The other problem with <unk> <unk> : we are the most <unk> on Earth .
We &apos;re going to grow up in World War II since World War II .
<unk> our <unk> in the room .
<unk> together , we <unk> over <unk> , <unk> bombs .
<unk> , of course , we have a <unk> .
We &apos;ve been in World War or more different than World War II .
Over the years , I &apos;m not going to tell you that we &apos;re not going to be afraid — ( Applause ) — we &apos;re not the <unk> bomb .
But in any other way , those things that are willing to be afraid of violence and the <unk> of the <unk> of domestic sexual violence .
The other thing is , the <unk> , the men &apos;s boss .
( Applause ) It &apos;s true .
And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I can tell you that I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s just like , &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s just like when I was small when I was a small and old lady .
<unk> <unk> , the World War II , the World War II , the World War II , if the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But for that time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t have thought that they were going to be , but they &apos;re wrong , because they have the <unk> <unk> of the courts , the <unk> schools , the <unk> schools , and the whole thing is the same thing that there are today , because that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do today , because that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do today , because that &apos;s what it is .
Even when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to run out of the <unk> .
And most men who have a global system , a lot of men who are going to create a legal system , a lot of men who are engaged in the world , and most of the men who are going to have the world , and most of the men who are going to make a big difference .
Do we have to do today today ?
I would say , well , the best thing that we could do for women is that we could be able to do that for women with disabilities like this , and where you &apos;re going to be able to do that , and so forth , who has an effect to take care of ourselves , to be more inclined to finish the world .
And I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to say in a black woman .
But I hope that then , after this conference , women are willing to take care of their peers , and in their careers , and in the future , in the future of jobs , we need to be able to protect our grandparents .
I &apos;ve got 12 pounds of children , and I &apos;m often thinking about them , and I &apos;m often thinking about them , and it &apos;s not only when they live in the wrong way , and I hope that all of you are going to make me care for women in the world and protect them right , and protect them right .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
When I was a <unk> , the future of the world &apos;s <unk> , the future of the world .
<unk> growth was not going to stop .
<unk> <unk> was <unk> .
<unk> cancer , <unk> <unk> in the world , was going to make our lives .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> would be <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t there . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) It wasn &apos;t there . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) But what you do is , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to look at , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to look at , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
In my life , I had an ally of life for 30 percent .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> food per capita .
And the only thing that &apos;s been inspired by this is the most competitive thing , how did you get in the trenches ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s population , and this <unk> shows in the world .
To answer this question , you have to figure out how to deal with this idea , and you have to figure out how to deal with it , and you have to figure out what &apos;s going on .
In other words , you have to figure out how many sex ideas are .
I want you to imagine what we &apos;re going to do in which we were going to be able to figure out what we &apos;ve done to create .
Over 30,000 generations .
<unk> , there were some changes , but the app would be able to change the skeleton in the skeleton .
It &apos;s a <unk> phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
The hour on the right is the one on the back of five years .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) <unk> and <unk> .
And more than that , with ideas of different ideas — ideas of <unk> , ideas and ideas .
They were volunteers .
And this is an amazing thing , because I think that I think this is the key to knowing what &apos;s happening in the world .
The heart of the body is also determined by the idea : the idea is , the idea is , this is the idea of <unk> <unk> , the idea of <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> together .
How do you look at something like this ?
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> species , if you have two different components of the world around the world .
One of the things that &apos;s going to happen is to make a difference .
Now , many of the things that have been able to be able to be able to be able to get the people in the midst of people who are going to be able to do a lot of people who are going to be able to do this .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to have to do with the <unk> of the <unk> innovation .
It &apos;s not a <unk> .
Now , what do I mean by thinking about this , as well as the advent of a revolution , is in a <unk> revolution ?
And I think that the answer is , this is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> doesn &apos;t do that .
The culture may not exist .
Maybe you can be a <unk> culture .
<unk> has a culture .
They are taught by one of their peers who are born from parents &apos; parents .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s going to be true .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t have a <unk> .
So what &apos;s going to do is , what &apos;s going on in the fetal mind ?
The answer is that the answer is that we &apos;ve got to go back to the U.K.
I think it &apos;s an explanation in the 21st century that he also had to be able to look at the World War II .
Adam <unk> <unk> for four hours and three hours .
The Oz is <unk> <unk> for one hour and two hours .
You &apos;re going to have the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; in the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> Adam Adam .
It &apos;s going to be able to do your <unk> and <unk> .
You know , if you &apos;re going to have two knobs and Adam <unk> and Adam <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which gives you the ability to be able to innovate and so forth and so forth .
Adam and Oz at the time of his time .
<unk> yourself : how long you would have to work , if you want to work , if you want to work , if you want to be able to do that , you want to be able to do that .
If you look at it , you &apos;re going to have to be <unk> .
How much of you do that ?
How many of you are going to work on an hour &apos;s time on an hour &apos;s license for reading if you &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
You &apos;re going to spend seven of a half seconds of your colonoscopy in 1950 .
You &apos;re going to be 15 minutes old , and you &apos;re going to get to that number 15 minutes in order to be able to do that .
You would have to work for six hours to go to the <unk> , which would be an hour of an hour .
So let &apos;s go back to the <unk> , and you ask , &quot; &quot; Who did it and for you ? &quot;
<unk> <unk> on the right to me .
How much people did it ?
<unk> ? <unk> ? <unk> ?
You know , I think it &apos;s millions .
For me .
And that &apos;s a society .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve been looking at .
<unk> hours , if you were angry , people literally worked on you .
They were making it <unk> , and they were doing it , and they were doing it , and they were doing it , and they were doing it , and they were doing it .
<unk> people <unk> <unk> .
But you know , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
They &apos;re in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re going to give you a little bit of food , and they &apos;re going to give you the food that you &apos;re going to do , and they &apos;re going to give you the food that you &apos;re going to be able to eat .
<unk> standards .
In fact , there are other people who work on each other .
<unk> is an example .
<unk> is <unk> .
Even though we don &apos;t have <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) Now , when they started this behavior ?
It &apos;s a good thing to do .
But I don &apos;t have that .
There &apos;s a great job of working on the food .
<unk> men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> knows .
And he knows that he &apos;s not going to be able to make sure that he &apos;s not going to touch the <unk> .
Everything that we need is <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t doing that .
They were strong <unk> .
They were very intelligent .
But there &apos;s no evidence that they had to be a <unk> job .
There &apos;s no good for women .
<unk> that women are born with men .
Now , there &apos;s no way that you &apos;ve got to be able to distinguish between , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to have to do with the <unk> , the devices that they were doing , they were always made out of the <unk> <unk> .
For example , there &apos;s a place where you have a place where it was a <unk> device .
They &apos;re always going to be made by the <unk> <unk> .
And in the same same way , there &apos;s a lot of people in the same way that we &apos;ve got to be able to do that in the same way that we don &apos;t want to be able to be able to do that , you know , if you want to be able to do that , you know , we &apos;re going to be able to do that , you know , we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
When the person began to master the <unk> , it &apos;s a little bit of what they &apos;re going to do with the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , thousands of years ago , in Africa , where we see that <unk> and other people have a big stranger with a big stranger .
Similarly , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the 200 kilometers of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what the groups started to do .
And that &apos;s what it is .
They put them together with these kinds of things that are more powerful , and as a result , some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What happens when you get older people from the oppressed , from the capabilities and the capabilities ?
The answer is that it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> , but it can &apos;t even take it in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of people who have been exposed to people from their grandparents , and they actually had the first run .
And that &apos;s because the population in 4,000 people have been not enough to support the <unk> skills , to support their technology .
It wasn &apos;t going to happen to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The thing is , in fact , <unk> <unk> <unk> from the United States , a lot more <unk> .
<unk> were <unk> .
Back then , again , again , it wasn &apos;t just who did it for a while , but who knew how to do that ?
No , literally seven .
The person on the <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which he has , and nobody knows how to do it , because people don &apos;t know how to do it , because they don &apos;t know how to eat , because they don &apos;t know how to eat trees , but they don &apos;t know how to wash the trees and all of them .
And what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve done that in the <unk> , the path of <unk> and <unk> , we have an opportunity to do things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same thing .
But with technology , the technology of the tech technology .
In fact , I &apos;m not going to work on a <unk> level , or maybe a group of more I.Q. than other groups .
It &apos;s not my mind .
It has a definition of how good people are going to take their ideas , and how good they are , not how good they are .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> brain .
We &apos;re just going to just jump into the <unk> .
We are neurons of this brain .
<unk> ideas , <unk> and <unk> ideas , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s not less than less or less things .
The future , as long as we &apos;re going forward , we &apos;re going to take the <unk> .
<unk> war , depression , <unk> <unk> .
There are more things in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I also believe that because of the connections that people , the ability of world-changing people , the ability of the ideas to be understood , and I also believe that technology is going to be a <unk> .
Because that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to go through , and so forth , you know , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to make sure that we are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the same thing .
Thank you .
