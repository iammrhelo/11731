And then the end of this year is going to be about a <unk> person who is using a lot of <unk> .
They &apos;re going to tell them about what they &apos;re doing .
Now , this is a false thought , but I think it &apos;s in a serious way that I think I &apos;m going to do .
I thought that I thought about it and I was going to be able to do this , and I was going to be able to do that in the hospital .
Her family had his family and friends write to write a post to her death .
That &apos;s what he said in the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s my death . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s my last friend of mine .
So I &apos;m going to be wondering how only my body would get rid of the cancer of the breast cancer , my family , my family , and my friends , and my friends , who would be able to be able to be better , and more likely to be able to be better , and more importantly , the answer is that today , <unk> <unk> could be better , and more importantly , the answer is that today , all of the things that are wrong with what was going on .
<unk> a little <unk> .
Now 48 hours of video YouTube videos .
It &apos;s about 200 million hectares .
<unk> <unk> generates 90 <unk> per month .
When you look at your parents , if you &apos;re talking about your parents , they &apos;ve created a few <unk> , or they take a video of a video , or a piece of a video , or a person who &apos;s going to get into the <unk> .
But today , we &apos;re going to be an incredibly good idea of the <unk> , which is going to live in the world as much time for our death .
I think this creates an extremely powerful opportunity for the <unk> .
For example , I &apos;m not going to be wondering , but I &apos;m not going to be able to do this , because I &apos;m going to be able to give you a sense of what &apos;s going on and what &apos;s going to happen in the future , what &apos;s going to happen .
We &apos;re seeing some of the things that allow us to be able to do that , and that we are going to be able to figure out that we are going to be able to be able to deal with ourselves .
Once one of them would be able to find me , I &apos;ve found that I found myself in a way that I found myself in the morning at the end .
( Laughter ) Adam : <unk> .
TBP : Adam ?
And so .
<unk> : <unk> can take you anywhere in any hour , even in the same hour .
And what do you do ?
<unk> : <unk> on <unk> , &#91; &quot; &quot; if I &apos;m not going to be dead .
( Laughter ) And the answer is , if you &apos;re not true ?
It makes a very simple thing to do , and it makes it easy to create a message or a video that can be written on Facebook after your time .
Number two , I &apos;ve got 1,000 steps .
And it &apos;s going to allow the online to look at the Internet , and it &apos;s the video of the video , and it &apos;s a video of the video , and it &apos;s a video that they can do with your own .
But the next thing is , it &apos;s just a <unk> .
Many of you may have heard of an expert by Roy Roy , who is in a <unk> way , as he had to do more than a half hours of video .
I think , with the enormity of the ability to understand the human language , and we &apos;ve got to look at the information of the data , going to be possible for the rest of the life — the <unk> , the video , the video , the things that we &apos;re going to do with the <unk> , the <unk> , the videos , the videos , the things that we &apos;re going to have to do with the <unk> .
And I think , as just as it is , for us to think about it , for our own <unk> , to be able to be able to serve ourselves in a way that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to deal with our own , because we &apos;ve got to solve the technology that we &apos;ve created , and the techniques that we &apos;ve created , the technology that we create .
Now we &apos;re going to take a couple of polygons .
There &apos;s such a <unk> — I &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> all your own records in the <unk> , everything you &apos;re going to do , and it makes sure you can write the next .
So , as you can see , it can be a <unk> device .
Imagine if something like this is going to look at five , 10 or 20 years old or 20 years old .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is how people can be .
And if you could be able to be able to look at the <unk> <unk> , the hundreds of thousands of people who are created in a few of thousands of people who are created for a whole life .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> from the United States in 2008 , when I was in the United States in 2008 , when he had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what if we could use this technology for the <unk> of our <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that they created , as a rabbi ?
And I think that it &apos;s a really good thing to do , and it &apos;s a little bit of a solution to it , and it &apos;s a little bit of a solution for them to make a difference in the <unk> .
So , I think , I think we &apos;re going to think about it , and we &apos;re going to be wondering , if we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and if it &apos;s going to be true , it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You know , you &apos;ve heard the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
First of all , the first <unk> is the <unk> .
The other thing is , from the <unk> <unk> .
We really understand more about the harshness of the reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer these questions .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
So this is a piece of what you want to understand .
And then you can do that , you know , they &apos;re going to do it .
that we have to do with the <unk> of the Universe .
And these systems are <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> fish , <unk> <unk> .
And what &apos;s interesting is that these systems are going to be <unk> <unk> .
What are we going to do about this ?
It &apos;s like a <unk> , even though it &apos;s a <unk> behavior .
And to try to understand the system , and to try to understand the system , and to try to understand the system , and that &apos;s what we do .
So on this system .
<unk> , literally , it doesn &apos;t have a system from its own parts .
It &apos;s in the middle of a <unk> network .
But why not ?
Where is the infrastructure ?
We &apos;re going to look at <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
You may not have noticed that no one has ever seen before .
&quot; How do they do it ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Are they angry ? &quot;
Or , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s a company that &apos;s working on more than one degree , and there &apos;s 23,000 .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Where about 75 percent of all of them were born .
It &apos;s in the middle of the structure .
But what they &apos;re going to do is 95 percent of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the answer to the question about who is going on ?
You can do other things that you need .
<unk> through a <unk> .
So one of the things that &apos;s going on is it &apos;s going to go through a <unk> net net .
And these are the main principles of the U.K.
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So I want to tell you , I want to worry about what is going on in the way that I &apos;m talking about .
In fact , if we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know about you , but when I imagine this , you see the stage , you see the stage , and you can see the whole thing as a person , and he &apos;s going to be able to do it , and he &apos;s going to be able to do it in a way .
And I mean , it &apos;s like that , because it &apos;s not the <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s happening with us without our own .
I &apos;ve been studying , and I &apos;m also going to get English in English , which means that I &apos;m going to live in life .
You can say , and I &apos;d like to argue that there is a lot of things that we &apos;re going to be able to do , so that we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a solution to that , perhaps , even a large part of them .
So , love , we &apos;re going to be disappointed .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
We are <unk> .
<unk> makes us crazy , and it makes us tick .
<unk> hearts and then <unk> .
So this is how we &apos;re going to have an opportunity for someone to do it for someone to do it .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like this .
And they take us as a result of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And then you know , you know , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you look at that word in a <unk> word , ( Laughter ) and if you look at this word , it means that it means that it means &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In fact , there &apos;s 16 <unk> on the word &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of God .
( Laughter ) We have the same words to look for the love of love , which is the <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> ?
So how did this happen ?
How are we going to do this for a while , and we &apos;re going to be wondering about how we &apos;re going to do this ?
And why are we talking about this as a kind of good experience , how would we be ?
It &apos;s a hard question , but I have a few <unk> .
And so that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with this , I want to look at one of the <unk> <unk> that I &apos;m going to love as crazy .
When I first started studying my love in love , I was going to put these crazy things around .
And the story of the story of the <unk> culture , which is the ultimate love of love for the <unk> .
Here &apos;s a few examples .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; &quot; <unk> is just a crazy thing to do , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) There &apos;s always a lone nut , and he said , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s always a lone nut .
I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> on me , I &apos;m going to get rid of the word &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
I was born in 20 years old , and this was a long way to do things from early days .
It was a lot of relationships for the last few years , because for me , it was a very high school , and it was a very high school .
I remember one moment .
I &apos;m going to go down in the bed in the Gulf of America , and I &apos;m going to be wondering how I &apos;m going to put the door to the door .
It was a <unk> , it was almost a <unk> , and we snuck in our bedroom , and when we went into our bedroom , he was doing things in the <unk> and <unk> .
I don &apos;t remember that I don &apos;t remember that I &apos;m going to remember this <unk> , I &apos;m pretty sure I remember it .
I was 22 , it was the first thing I was looking at , and I was the first one .
I knew that I was going to go home , I knew the name of the city in which I knew the name of the city , and the name of the city in which I had to be able to be able to be able to do it , but I didn &apos;t have a clue , as I was going .
I didn &apos;t have a <unk> , and I had no idea , and I didn &apos;t know it .
I had a little bit more <unk> for me , and I could do it as a moment , but I &apos;m going to do it .
I &apos;m just going to get there .
And then the <unk> .
But no matter what I &apos;m going to do , a little voice in my head in my head , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It was a <unk> .
I mean , I &apos;m really going to do this . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because of course , I mean , I mean , I mean , I mean , I think that I had the experience of myself in the experience of myself .
Now , this is pretty good for me , but at the age of 22 , I was going to have a <unk> <unk> , and at that moment , I was a <unk> , and I thought that this was a little bit of me , but I thought this was a little bit of me , but I thought this was a little bit of me , and I thought this was a little bit of my name .
I think , at the level of the level , I &apos;m going to be able to be <unk> <unk> , because I thought it was so love and it works .
It doesn &apos;t really need to be a <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t need eight <unk> , 14 songs , two <unk> and one of them , and one of the things that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> Love . &quot; &quot; She sat in front of his room .
We are <unk> .
It &apos;s a real <unk> .
But you know , you know , it &apos;s kind of like me , and it &apos;s kind of like my innocence , and it wasn &apos;t very good for me , or it wasn &apos;t good for me or for it .
But I think that this kind of works is not very good .
Most of us had to put themselves in a little bit , and we had a little bit of <unk> on a pedestal .
In fact , there &apos;s a belief that this is going to happen , because it &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s not very easy .
That &apos;s really true .
It &apos;s a <unk> , 1999 , <unk> <unk> , so that the death rate is very similar to the <unk> in the people with the <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So it also has also been to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
So there &apos;s a couple of things that love that love to do with our <unk> and <unk> .
And the other thing is that the majority of the things that most of you have learned is that most of the things that most people do have .
<unk> <unk> , which is the highest quality of the face of the conversation with the idea of being told , that a little bit like someone who looks like someone else in the head .
And the majority of us would be surprised to yourself when the first thing is .
It &apos;s only a few months for a few months .
When I came out of my trip in my tour , I spent a lot of time in my bedroom that I &apos;ve done in my bedroom , I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my bedroom .
I thought , if my friends don &apos;t know how to understand the mountain , I &apos;m going to put them together .
And so I &apos;m going to get rid of them with me .
And that was probably the same year in my life .
But I think I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be honest — that &apos;s my job , because if I was a teenager , then I &apos;m going to be able to figure out how hard I am .
And if I &apos;m going to do it , then we would end up with the end of the whole thing .
It &apos;s kind of a crazy thing , because there &apos;s no legal rule , it &apos;s not there , that &apos;s what a big deal is , which is a big deal , but we &apos;re talking about love , as if it is true .
Our experiences and our experiences , and our experiences .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Love says that love is good , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s not good , it &apos;s going to be a good thing , if it &apos;s going to be a parent or a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , you &apos;ve probably heard about this — you &apos;ve heard about this , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be talking about this .
( Laughter ) And our culture is a <unk> culture , so that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do about love .
And in this case , we &apos;re talking about <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s crazy .
It &apos;s a very interesting thing to do .
And we &apos;re going to look at the <unk> and the clock , and we &apos;re going to bring it through our words and the story , but then our minds and the story of us , and we &apos;re talking about the stories that we &apos;re talking about .
And what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s all happening in a culture that is the <unk> of the <unk> .
And we &apos;re going to look at the wrong way , and we &apos;re crazy , and we want it to do it .
It &apos;s loud .
( Laughter ) To this extent , we need to change our culture , or change our culture .
Imagine that we would all be smaller in the <unk> .
If we were more <unk> , more likely to be solved , more likely to be a new , more <unk> , and if we &apos;re going to be born in love .
I know that it requires a lot , but I &apos;m not the first person to do this .
In the book , we live with &quot; &quot; Richard <unk> , &quot; &quot; and George <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> , and it &apos;s even more likely to be able to look at what we &apos;re going to do with our own vocal tract , as the ones that are going on .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> is a new <unk> for <unk> , which is a <unk> of art .
I &apos;m really good at this way that I &apos;m going to look at this way .
Now , it &apos;s saying that you have a tendency to think about what it is , and there &apos;s a way to distinguish all of them , or the ideas that are going to be in the world .
<unk> and <unk> tell me about what they &apos;re going to do on the <unk> of art , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And so these ideas are good at the end of the <unk> , and it &apos;s very good at all , and it &apos;s also hard to work in the other way , but they also work with other <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because these are fraudulent offenders are much more likely to sum up ideas of someone &apos;s experience .
So if you love love — this is the ultimate <unk> of art , which is a dream experience .
<unk> <unk> , love <unk> , heart needs , love and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the love is , I &apos;m going to love the same thing with you .
<unk> , every single experience , every single experience .
When I was an outsider , you never had to do that , you couldn &apos;t do anything that was worthy of love .
And if you look at the first time , if you don &apos;t know the first time , if you don &apos;t even be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do anything , and she had four days ago , she wasn &apos;t going to be able to do it .
Where is it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> .
Right ?
And as a result , at this point , we &apos;re going to have a moment of <unk> , a little bit of a <unk> , a little bit of <unk> .
He <unk> , he <unk> , it &apos;s just a little bit of a <unk> .
I understand that I &apos;m going to understand that I &apos;m going to be able to do this , and I &apos;m going to understand that , but when I read this <unk> , it was also in 14 years old , and I had an amazing idea for me .
So I &apos;m going to love that one thing that I &apos;m going to do with that , and not what I &apos;m going to do with me , not what happens to me , not what happens to me , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
But it &apos;s still hard .
And when I was concerned about it , it &apos;s about the same thing , and when I get my sense of self , I have to ask myself , my job , my job , I have to ask myself : my personal challenge to my partners about what I want to do .
It &apos;s also <unk> .
But that &apos;s a lot better than a second <unk> , which is a lone nut .
This is the number of things that you don &apos;t have to do on a <unk> or a loan .
Instead , they need to be able to do this , and they need to be able to do it , and they need to be able to do it , which is not easy , but , in fact , it &apos;s not easy , but , in fact , it &apos;s going to be very simple , but , in fact , it &apos;s going to be very simple .
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and whether we &apos;re going to be willing to think about themselves and to start thinking about how you &apos;re going to be a <unk> .
And this is the first one that lets us say things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we are not very good at all . &quot; &quot; I mean , we don &apos;t know .
Or , &quot; &quot; These are the things that were going to be <unk> than I am , but it was really great . &quot; &quot; Now , this was great .
So this is the number of things that we can do , how they look .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m going to go in a way that I was born with a little bit of a <unk> car , from the city of the city , that I was sitting in front of my <unk> , right in the city , which is in the <unk> .
You know , you know , it &apos;s going to be when you look at it , and you &apos;re not going to go on a <unk> , a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I was going to get into a <unk> <unk> , and I was going to be wondering about what I was going to do with me , and I wondered what I &apos;ve been talking about .
&quot; What is it that &apos;s going to be there ? &quot;
Her eyes on his forehead .
So you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have a very good job for it .
( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a couple of <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to get a little bit of <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to panic , because she understands .
That &apos;s me .
( Laughter ) Here he is , this <unk> <unk> site . ( Laughter )
And in the last five years , I &apos;ve been looking at a lot about this , which is that we &apos;re sometimes thinking about this , and how we look at it , and how we do it , and what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to look forward to the human beings .
So I &apos;ve been studying the last five years in the last five years that I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
I have a choice of a career in a way that you can imagine , but it &apos;s a huge <unk> competition for a place .
( Laughter ) In fact , the majority of us would be from the end of our mind , or if I don &apos;t want to think about the opportunity to think about it .
We understand that .
We realize that sometimes everybody in this room is born .
We are people , we &apos;re going to be angry . Excellent .
But if on the right side of me , at this moment , I &apos;ve got all this time in this time , and I &apos;ve got all of the things that I &apos;ve got , and I &apos;ve got all of the things that I can &apos;t imagine , that I can &apos;t think of it .
What &apos;s interesting is that we live in this unprecedented period of time .
So we got a little bit at the same time , and they have the same thing to do with the same thing , and they have the same thing to do with their voice .
We &apos;re all going to realize that we all live through a life that we &apos;re always going to be right .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
And I think this is a problem , and every one of us , on a personal or a personal level , is that we all have a society .
What I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to talk today — this is a <unk> because we &apos;re going to have a <unk> in your <unk> .
Secondly , this is why it &apos;s going to be an approach .
And what I want you to do is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that &apos;s the best thing to do with you , and that &apos;s the best of all sorts of things that you can do .
So why are we going to do this ?
And one of the things that happened is that we have a <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> you , you know , because you &apos;re going to be here , you know , you &apos;re going to be here . You &apos;re wrong ?
<unk> .
<unk> . Excellent . Excellent .
<unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to give them to the other question .
And you ask the question , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the sense of the belief that you &apos;re not supposed to be . &quot;
( Laughter ) So , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> to make sense of how it was broken , and yet the whole thing is not ?
For example , it might be a sense of emotion , or a sense of awkwardness , or even though , as I &apos;ve got to do with my own <unk> <unk> .
But the state itself is not very specific about the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
Do you recall <unk> companies , where are the ones that are going to have an hour for an hour of the car , but not a <unk> <unk> ?
It &apos;s almost that in every single one of the things that &apos;s going on in every single one of the things that &apos;s going to be on the ground and the same thing with the rocks of the rock that is the <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
But every time you hit a rock with the rocks right now for a second .
And what &apos;s going on , especially when you &apos;re only six years old , is what it is to do with it .
It &apos;s just continuing to do it until it wasn &apos;t going to be on the floor , and it &apos;s not just that it &apos;s going to be wrong .
That &apos;s what he called <unk> .
And if we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , but we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s going to be wrong , and then we &apos;re going to get the wrong thing , and then we &apos;re going to get a rock .
<unk> , we &apos;ve been invited , we &apos;ve got to do that , but we still feel confident about the ground .
I &apos;ve got to give you a sense of what I said .
There &apos;s a sense of the sense in the <unk> , the sense of the self .
( Laughter ) Now , this is what we learned to do with the <unk> of our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to make this kind of <unk> <unk> .
We have no idea , we don &apos;t have a <unk> , if we fail until we fail .
There &apos;s another reason why we &apos;re going to be able to do that , and it &apos;s more unstable to culture .
Imagine a <unk> school .
You &apos;re going to be angry , and you &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , this is not my birthday .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in your school and you know what to think about what we think is going to look like this .
And he <unk> and <unk> , he never makes a difference .
So , even though it &apos;s an older age , you &apos;ve learned that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to achieve success .
We &apos;re going to put these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Most of us , and I think , especially in this audience , is treated by this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Or don &apos;t , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s the same thing , it &apos;s the same ?
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like you &apos;re all about the same thing , and you &apos;re going to be able to do it .
It will be .
It &apos;s only when we realized that we may be able to figure out that we may be in a little bit of something .
Because in this case , if we do our <unk> , we &apos;re going to pretend that something is not about us .
So we &apos;re going to focus on your own , because we &apos;re going to feel a little bit of yourself , and we &apos;re going to be angry , and we &apos;re going to be angry .
Let &apos;s tell you about an accident .
A few years ago , a woman &apos;s name has been <unk> <unk> a woman &apos;s name .
This hospital lies in a <unk> .
At this point , this <unk> <unk> student student students , he &apos;s one of his favorites .
A woman who was born and moved into the room .
And she was sitting in front of her classmates , and he sat down on her shoulder , and he snuck over her bedroom , and he snuck in her bedroom .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; Why am I not going to do that ? &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to do that ?
And when I was talking about this , he said , &quot; &quot; Well , when I was talking about it , he told something very specific .
&quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; that he was working on a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So what I &apos;m going to do is , because I think about it , because you know , what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , what you &apos;re going to do on your wallet is something that you &apos;re going to do with a little bit of something .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we all sometimes think of , is no matter what happens in the world that actually happens in the world .
And if we &apos;re in our own world , we &apos;re only looking at it as well as we don &apos;t even think about the power of our <unk> , and we do a <unk> , and we do a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and we &apos;re going to be able to do this .
It &apos;s a big problem for a <unk> problem .
But that &apos;s also a challenge for a society .
<unk> on the <unk> , which means the sense of parenting .
That means that your mind is a self-fulfilling <unk> reality .
With this , the biggest challenge is to tell people what to do with you , and that &apos;s what you do .
<unk> , most of us , for people to do with other people with their own <unk> <unk> .
So the first thing we think is , if somebody , we don &apos;t think they &apos;re wrong , they don &apos;t care about the answer .
They don &apos;t have access to the information that you have , and if you look at this information with them , they &apos;re going to be a little bit of them , and they &apos;re playing with your own .
If we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to tell them that they &apos;re going to take us off with us , but we don &apos;t have to do that , but we &apos;re going to go into the back of the second <unk> — that &apos;s what they are .
( Laughter ) Before they all have a lot of stuff to do , and they don &apos;t care about it .
And if it doesn &apos;t work , if we realize that people don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t know , you know , they &apos;re going to be wrong , and they &apos;re pretty good at all , and we &apos;re going to know that they know , but for their own <unk> , we &apos;re going to know the truth , but for their own <unk> , they &apos;re going to know the truth .
It &apos;s a disaster .
Now , when you look at the end of the world , we don &apos;t have a very good achievement , and it &apos;s not a good thing , especially if it &apos;s going to be true , and it &apos;s going to take us to each other .
And what I &apos;m doing is , I think , more than all of this , and I think that this is a kind of kind of thing that is the kind of thing that we &apos;re seeing in the human psyche .
<unk> , we want to believe that our grandparents are the ones that we can see , that we can measure them in orbit , which is exactly what we can do .
And we want to be able to look at all of the things that we want to look at , and we saw exactly what we saw .
It &apos;s the same thing , and it would be incredible .
Our minds are not in the way we can see the light that it is .
What we can see is that we can see light not like there .
We can have a <unk> story about the future , and we can look at the future of other people in places .
And it &apos;s because everybody sees it , and we can look at the end of the universe , and we can see it , and that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s about the idea of this .
Over the 200 years , as a result , as a result , as a result , I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
<unk> realized that the fact of the fact that we have to do this is not a very good idea of a system , not something that &apos;s going to be on a pedestal or something .
It &apos;s the <unk> of our own .
Because we don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t really know what this world is doing .
We &apos;re going to get rid of the other animals , and we &apos;re going to try to do this light .
I think that this is a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> of our own .
I started to listen to a lot of medical programs , and I started to listen to a lot of medical programs , &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> life . &quot;
I &apos;m sure , listen , and I &apos;ve been thinking , and I &apos;m going to experience that all of the things I &apos;m going to do is that all of the things that I &apos;m going to do .
I thought , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m always always like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m always crazy .
It seems to me everywhere . &quot; &quot; <unk> .
But as many months at the time , I have a chance to share a book called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a <unk> program .
I &apos;ve got to do that with it , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really something . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , I mean , it &apos;s even published that the program has even been published , that in every single one .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I thought it &apos;s going to be something that I thought it was going to do , and it happened to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which is interesting , &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting is that we have to do this .
We need this kind of thing to do with this , and we &apos;re going to be able to make these kinds of <unk> , &quot; &quot; What about all of us , &quot; &quot; and what we &apos;re all about , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
We have <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
What we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to have a <unk> .
But you know , you know , we &apos;re going to be aware that our own life is .
We think that will be true .
George Bush thought that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it happened .
And also , the reason for Mubarak Mubarak was that they &apos;re going to have a good job for the rest of his life until they were born and humiliated , and then she &apos;s going to have a great job of son .
And it happened .
And you would argue that you &apos;ve argued , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to know that it &apos;s going to be wrong .
And it happened .
I have to tell you that I &apos;m going to write a book about something that I &apos;m going to write about something that I &apos;m going to write a book about something that is never going to be .
And it happened .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a life .
We &apos;re going to focus on the ideas about the gravitational light , which is not the best thing to do , and it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s the light of the <unk> and the <unk> .
You don &apos;t know , but the whole thing is that there is a lot of the kind of thing that we &apos;re going to do with our <unk> .
We &apos;re going to get a whole bunch of work with innovation , about innovation and engineering , but you know why we need these innovations , and we &apos;re going to be able to innovate ?
Because half of the ideas that were crazy , they had the ability to change the world , and they had the ability to change the world , and the answer to TED , which is where there was a lot of things that were crazy .
( Laughter ) Don &apos;t worry about it , or not ? ( Laughter )
Where my <unk> <unk> , Chris Anderson ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we come over here .
And it &apos;s going to be exhausting .
So we did another idea .
We &apos;ve done another story .
We &apos;re going to do this with another .
<unk> <unk> , as you &apos;ve already heard seven million times , is like a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , I mean , if you really want to be a <unk> <unk> , which is the rise of the boundary of the world , and the <unk> of the space of your grandparents &apos; and the mystery of the Universe and the mystery of the Universe and the creator to say , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m going to panic . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At the beginning , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So fortunately , these plans were awarded to the FBI Department .
But I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to have a <unk> in the middle of the car , but I don &apos;t know .
And they got the same thing as a result in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is my father .
I was born in a <unk> , and I was born in my family , and I was born with my family , and I had a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he started to ask my childhood <unk> .
But if I was seven years old , I was born in our family , and I started <unk> .
My father showed me that I had a little friend of mine who had a little <unk> to see , including even most Muslims .
And my experience shows that when people do one of each other , they take a lot of time to understand that we want to do one of the same thing .
But in fact , in the same way , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , every single one of the people that makes them feel that they are capable of using their wallets , that they can make the rest of them live .
And in a few months , the father had a father who told me that a few years later , he had a colleague of mine with a colleague of mine at the University of Long Beach .
He said that the next thing I was going to do with it .
We are focused on the <unk> <unk> , which is the FBI <unk> .
And that day , my last year was in the little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and it was a <unk> <unk> , and she was in the middle of my mother , and she was in my head .
My father was a friend of mine , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the father of the father was a father .
They &apos;ve got very hard to do this , but only within a few years , I realized it was the meaning of it .
They saw me the same thing as a dad , which was my father .
Now , as a result of these people , they had a <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It was the men that I was doing .
<unk> people I &apos;m going to call &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; That means &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; that means &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; meaning .
I &apos;m going to get a place for 20 times , and this is my childhood experience of my childhood and my childhood <unk> .
Every time I started to experience myself in one place , I had an hour of my life with a little bit of things , and I &apos;m going to get an hour of the world .
<unk> is always a new teacher at the class , and I often had a little <unk> .
I &apos;m going to put my <unk> in the wrong way , but I don &apos;t have the attention , but I &apos;m not going to be able to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m not going to get paid , but I &apos;m going
They &apos;re playing games playing games .
And what I &apos;ve learned is that my social media had been inspired by telling me , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;ve been studying the people on the top of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or race .
What does my eyes give me ?
First of all , the majority of them were inspired by this dream , and it happened during the year <unk> <unk> .
I was able to do a <unk> program , and I was able to do this with a <unk> , and I was able to put in the <unk> .
My group had been violent violence .
Members of our groups are using the most different institutions .
Once again , I would argue that one of my new friends had been <unk> .
Because this is just a few days ago , a few days later , a few days later , a little bit of a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
I had never had my friends before , and I &apos;m honest , I &apos;m going to tell you , I was going to give the point that I was going to have a <unk> bar that I had never had my life .
<unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> , and it was a <unk> park .
And I &apos;ve been bringing people around the world and the cultures , and that experience , and this experience is fundamental in my personality .
It wasn &apos;t a good thing to do .
Like , I had an opportunity to be able to do this , and I had an opportunity to be able to do that , and I quickly realized that a lot of them were going to be published , and I quickly realized that a lot of them were going to have been published , and I quickly realized that a lot of them were going to have been published , and I quickly realized that a lot of them were going to have been published , and I quickly realized that a lot of them were going
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , as a child , had a sense of appreciation for other people , and for me , I &apos;m going to give you a sense of appreciation for other people , and it &apos;s not like I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
It &apos;s a sense of what I &apos;m going to do with this , which is that I was born in the checklisted childhood , and I &apos;m going to have a <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to ask you how it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
And then one of the things that happened then was the <unk> of John <unk> , and each of John <unk> John <unk> me to be able to figure out that race , whether the race , whether or not that , is not a common thing to do with the underlying human personality .
And in many <unk> , he had a <unk> , which I had so <unk> .
<unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I &apos;m going to understand that I &apos;m going to understand that I &apos;m going to understand that I &apos;m going to do more than I am .
And one day I was talking to my mother about how I started my mother , and she told me something that I &apos;m going to do in my heart .
She looked at me in front of me , and he looked at me on my eyes , and she looked at me , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do some people . &quot;
And at that moment , I realized how much power the power of energy is going to be in order to make it happen .
Zack <unk> is not my name .
I &apos;m going to shake it when my family and my family , and I decided to do a lot of things .
So what I was going to do with my brother and I was going to make my own identity , and I was going to ask myself ?
Well , it &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m doing this for me , that somebody who has a privilege to tell me , and I think , instead of violence , there &apos;s a better way to do that , but I &apos;m not going to be able to do that , but I wasn &apos;t going to be able to do that .
Instead , I would take my experiences with my experiences in the <unk> , in my face , in the <unk> .
I do that for a while , I &apos;m doing this for a while , and for them , for the fear and the dangers of the pain of the <unk> .
So , on my mind , I &apos;m going to talk about these <unk> , and I &apos;m going to talk about the actions of my parents .
I mean , I &apos;ve been able to see that violence is not the only part of the way that violence is , and that the son don &apos;t want to follow their parents .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) Thank you so much . ( Applause )
Or , it might be a matter of about how much of it is , or not that it can be a solution to your kids .
They &apos;re not the best for the other .
Maybe we can help make a large choice of less <unk> .
When I was an outsider .
So my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m in my head of <unk> , and I &apos;m in my head of <unk> .
And then you &apos;ve done that , and you &apos;ve got to study the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He <unk> , because the better thing is not there .
So you can see that it &apos;s going to be able to tell you a good choice .
But it can &apos;t be .
When you look at good good , I think it seems like a thought .
It &apos;s time for a family , and so forth .
<unk> , a career , will allow you to allow you to give you a sense of <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> .
When you look at the <unk> , it &apos;s going to be on a pedestal .
And you &apos;ve made a sense for yourself , and you &apos;ve made a sense for yourself .
And what we do is , if we do , we &apos;re going to be angry .
I &apos;m the one who likes to love with this .
And if we do , you know , if we &apos;re going to make a sense for yourself , if we &apos;re going to make a sense for yourself , if we &apos;re going to make a sense for yourself , if we &apos;re going to make a sense of it for yourself , if we &apos;re going to make a sense of it for yourself , if we &apos;re going to make a sense of it for yourself , if we &apos;re going to make a sense of it for yourself , if we &apos;re going to have
You &apos;re going to celebrate the most <unk> .
A few years ago , and then I decided to go back to the path , and I decided to go back to the path , the <unk> <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Morgan <unk> , Morgan <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go through these <unk> <unk> .
And instead of <unk> , it wasn &apos;t for months , an hour became a lot more <unk> .
This picture of my grandfather , when I was doing this , I was doing this for every day .
I &apos;m never going to be able to panic .
I &apos;m also going to do it .
In fact , <unk> <unk> is not to go to bed .
But I &apos;m going to get rid of the <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
I wasn &apos;t saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to look at the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to say I &apos;m going to say I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go .
I realized that when I was doing this , I realized that I was going to change the change , and I was going to see that I was going to be able to do this , and I was like , &quot; &quot; Well , what I did was I was going to do this .
The truth is , they do .
( Applause )
I &apos;m incredibly excited about the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the world in the world to be <unk> .
In 1975 , if I was seven years old , women were in the <unk> .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , and they had a sense of whether or not they had a <unk> room .
They came up with a <unk> <unk> , <unk> 90 percent of women — and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> percent of women &apos; women are going to ask them to ask themselves .
<unk> didn &apos;t work in the morning , because it doesn &apos;t work for women .
( Applause ) Within five years , the contractor had been diagnosed with the first <unk> in the world , which is the <unk> path of a woman in the world .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , when the President of the <unk> , I went to the balcony of my house , and they came up with the <unk> , and they came up with the <unk> .
( Applause ) It became a <unk> <unk> for me and every one that was growing up for me and every single time that I was growing up .
It &apos;s often a great story of the story of the teacher , and she said , &quot; &quot; How can I be able to do it , and then you say , &quot; &quot; How could I be able to become a feminist ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , the model is really important , but even with a lot of pressure , it &apos;s a matter , but even with a lot of strong <unk> , which I was like , &quot; &quot; Who am I going to be able to do this ? &quot;
Who am I going to be able to be compassionate ? &quot; &quot; <unk> that women are less likely to go on to the <unk> than men .
<unk> , <unk> in the United States in 2011 , is that 62 percent of the men who had their own <unk> , but it &apos;s only 45 percent of women .
We see the only 16 percent , and this is the same thing , which is the kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s a real <unk> , because I &apos;m going to argue that this world needs more and more inclusive leadership .
And so my decision is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a sense of what I &apos;m going to do with my own <unk> , even without any <unk> <unk> , I want to stand up and take care of the world that is going to be the meaning of the world that will be the meaning of the meaning of the world that will be the meaning of the meaning of the world that we really have to do with the meaning of our children .
It was my life .
It was great .
<unk> started with 20 <unk> <unk> .
And then , after the last year , I was going to be able to get paid for the first time , and finally , we ended up being rejected , three men and me .
( Applause ) But that &apos;s not the entire drama .
<unk> , you know , the United States has a drama , but I can tell you — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that , and we are in the <unk> <unk> .
First of the last 20 years , the president of the last 20 years , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong , it &apos;s perhaps the effect of that .
And then he got a <unk> , and it was a <unk> , and it was a <unk> <unk> , and he had a parent and his family .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , because the president of the president would argue that the <unk> needs a <unk> .
And in a few days , the connection of his family and her family and her family and her family , and he again was born with a <unk> .
But before I was thinking , he said , &quot; &quot; What does it do , because there are two men who are able to be able to be able to be able to be diagnosed with <unk> .
So , nine months of <unk> , for 45 days , on the right hand , the right thing for me was not very good .
I mean , I don &apos;t even know the room in the <unk> room .
<unk> <unk> , I had one percent , but it was the same thing , and it was a <unk> <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I was going to be able to put all of them together to get their own room for her to get their place in front of me and to get her to the <unk> , because the <unk> decided that I was going to have a couple of two and a half of his voice on the top .
And the same thing that I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to be there with three men , and I &apos;m going to be there with three men , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have a couple two and a half .
( Applause ) And on a pedestal .
The challenge that we had to do with this journey was to be connected to the same way , and they were going to be connected , and they were going to be connected .
<unk> .
Some of them would argue that the gender is going to be a little bit more like the gender and <unk> .
I can &apos;t do it .
I &apos;ve been able to have access to access to access to access , such as an hour in the media .
And I was talking about the <unk> , and I was going to be talking about <unk> media for a few months before I was born , and that hour , I had three times .
And I don &apos;t tell you what it is .
And I think the reason is that the reason is that the reason in the media is that the reason in the media , in the media , are the ones that are the <unk> and the <unk> , and we have to look at that when we want to change .
When I was getting access to TB , the first question was , &quot; &quot; Are you going to kill your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; It was a final question .
<unk> , from one to two and a half percent of the voice on it to understand it .
But the media is really the value , and every time I got to TB , we saw , and it felt like I &apos;m going to be able to deal with it , and I know that it &apos;s important , and why we need to worry about it .
And I had a little bit of a <unk> , and I had never been able to interview the first <unk> .
I was just looking at the whole thing that I was looking at from all the other things that the rest of the rest of the world are broken .
I &apos;m going to do this , but I &apos;m going to tell you this , but I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
There was no longer any way to get rid of me in front of me or a <unk> .
( Applause ) And what they &apos;re going to do is to do it .
But there &apos;s one other really important experiences .
I &apos;m going to be able to do this with a <unk> <unk> , without a <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
It &apos;s about understanding and testing , and it &apos;s possible for the resources of our company , but also to be able to do it differently .
Our company was <unk> , and so we got the tone of the voice for others .
Mo in this reason , because I wanted to show you a little bit of <unk> .
If you have access to the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to connect with an idea of information .
I &apos;m going to focus on Facebook , and I &apos;m going to look at Facebook , while I &apos;m going to play a little bit of this .
All right , all kinds of questions together , and we &apos;re going to look at that in front of us , because we believed in the <unk> , when we were in the <unk> , when we were born with a <unk> <unk> .
And when it turned out to be a little bit shaky on a young boy , I started to use the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell you how to do it , and I &apos;m going to look at each other , and I &apos;m going to look at each other at home .
I really got to find a lot of <unk> and <unk> , because I &apos;m going to get a little bit .
But because of that , we grew up with the numbers of <unk> <unk> .
I think it &apos;s possible to have a company and a way to do it .
I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t care about a lot of money .
And what it does is , it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true , and it was less important , and we had less resources .
<unk> , the reason it &apos;s partly was that , in my opinion , an hour was going to be a good thing to do with the <unk> .
And maybe I &apos;m going to do more with a little bit more with a <unk> .
Some say that it &apos;s very good .
But even with the media , the media and the <unk> , and it &apos;s only about the <unk> , but we &apos;ve got a lot of all of them in the afternoon , when you get the first numbers .
I &apos;m going to appreciate myself as you can see on a <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> of this data , I was walking with a <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) Well , too long , as a wound , because I wasn &apos;t going to get wet , but I took another place , and we came up with the same thing , and we came up with the <unk> of the <unk> , which was 10 percent of the voices that were going to be 10 percent of the <unk> .
And then I had to do that , and I had some sort of <unk> , and a lot of people were going to take me back .
But in fact , I &apos;m going to make a sense of what I &apos;m going to do with a little bit of a little bit , which is that I was going to be able to make a little bit more <unk> with a <unk> , and a large number of people who are going to have to do with me in 2040 .
( Applause ) Now she &apos;s 13 , and it never happened to be wasted .
But in the afternoon , I was going to put her on her to TB , and she was <unk> , she was his mother , she was his mother .
<unk> , it was the <unk> of my company .
( Applause ) But it was another one .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
This picture , for me , for me .
We can achieve the rest of what you see .
Yes , fear and problems .
( Applause ) <unk> in the public needs , and the hour of the women would be trained , let &apos;s say it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do .
And I &apos;m also going to tell you a little bit about your New Yorker called &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I got a new <unk> , &quot; &quot; The New Yorker <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , I &apos;ve got a new <unk> , because women are too often deformed for me , because women are too often deformed for me , but I know , I know , I know that we &apos;re just going to be doing that .
( Applause ) And we need to be more useful .
And the day we had a <unk> , because we felt that we felt .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to go to that , and you &apos;re going to go to that , and your family , and all of you who are going to work with you , if you &apos;re going to feel good , you &apos;re going to be good at the top that you &apos;re going .
We &apos;re good at the time , and I &apos;m going to ask why I &apos;m going to be able to do this , more than that , more than I can share with you on a pedestal .
But it wasn &apos;t obvious , it was a lot of work .
I was sleeping with my grandfather .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t want to go , and I &apos;m going to be able to figure out what I knew was one of the things that I knew was one of the things that I knew was one of the things that I knew was one of the things that I knew that I had had to do with one of the things that I was like to say .
As a parent , a good friend of mine , you know , you &apos;re going to be a little bit uncomfortable with your <unk> , but you don &apos;t have to appreciate you .
So I &apos;m also going to do this with you , and you all know , in any way , any kind of thing you know , any good thing is your team .
The people around the world are the obstacles that are going to take their values and their peers .
So for me , this is a matter of success , I &apos;m going to have an amazing question that today , a lot of the things that I &apos;m going to do with my family — ( Applause ) and my friends of friends , we &apos;re going to be able to look at ourselves as a <unk> , and we &apos;ll be able to figure out something , in words .
Well , I was talking about an outsider , and I said , &quot; &quot; How am I going to make a decision to make a decision , what would be good if I was seven percent .
I &apos;m going to give it a piece of view , because perhaps he &apos;s going to be right , and I put my message on a pedestal .
But one of the things that I thought was that I was going to show you what it is .
It &apos;s a very important thing , because I was really small , and I &apos;ve been working on working , and I &apos;ve worked with me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to achieve a lot if you &apos;re going to look at a lot of things about yourself .
And I think it &apos;s really important for me to think about it , and it &apos;s really important , and it &apos;s really important , and it &apos;s not less important if it &apos;s more important , and it &apos;s less important , it &apos;s not less important , and it &apos;s not less important , and it &apos;s not less important , it &apos;s a <unk> .
And this is all about me , and I decided to do something , and I wasn &apos;t going to pay attention to myself , partly because I &apos;m going to focus on the power of that time .
When I look at a moment at a moment — and this is an hour of the time , because it was a little bit of an hour from the time , because it was <unk> , and I &apos;m not just going to be able to do that , and on my own <unk> .
And I called our company <unk> , where the H means that the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means .
The first one of them is &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to be able to do the same thing , and I wanted to make the leadership as a coward , and I wanted to make the leadership as a coward .
Another word is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; or <unk> .
I decided to do that .
And I had a lot of money on this , no matter what it was .
And I &apos;m going to do all the things that I want to do with that .
It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was a <unk> for all of this .
I had no idea , and I had no idea on Facebook or Facebook .
And I think that you have the idea that you &apos;re going to ask the answers to your question .
And it &apos;s less important to say that the world is less important , we &apos;re going to have a company called <unk> <unk> , which is the power of power .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m really excited about what I found was that I found a lot of patience , so that we can get the success of the <unk> , and the success of the great <unk> .
I can &apos;t tell you what it was simple , but I &apos;m going to panic , and I think , on my team , a team of <unk> , and it was <unk> .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not going to tell you . I &apos;m not going to tell you . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) And I can &apos;t tell you that I can &apos;t do that , but I don &apos;t have any of you .
I mean , maybe all in this room are willing to be willing to do that , and you &apos;re going to have to do that .
We &apos;re not going to be able to deal with the rights of the voice there , but there &apos;s something that we can take in the wrong way , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s long enough to remember the 1975 of a year when women are going on the street , and it &apos;s really become <unk> by the way that the women are going to launch .
You &apos;re going to look at this <unk> before , and you &apos;re going to be able to figure out how to do it , as a <unk> <unk> , which is in the <unk> .
And you can see , because the media of the media doesn &apos;t want to do it , but in fact , it &apos;s not going to be on the street . Right ?
RS : Yeah . PM : Should we tell us about this ?
<unk> : 41 years from now that we can measure the world in the world to be able to be realistic , but we &apos;re going to work in the world as well .
So , in fact , <unk> , women in college have been working , because that hour after that time , they &apos;re going to take their own <unk> .
( Applause ) So what happened was that there was something that was going to be on the book , and the young people who were going to see the same thing before , because it was an hour for a moment , because it was an hour of the day .
PM : I &apos;m not going to talk to you now , and I &apos;m not going to focus on it , but I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be a big deal with this , if you &apos;re going to do it again .
Thank you .
CR : Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , I tried to think about my career , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to left my career , &quot; &quot; and the best example I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to go to The New Yorker , a few years ago .
<unk> <unk> , you look at the labels , says , &quot; &quot; Leonardo , if I grow up , I &apos;m going to be dead . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to have access to the world , because I &apos;ve got access to access to the people in the world , because I &apos;ve had access to access to people around the world .
I was not only about 50 <unk> in the United States , but we have my wife with more than a <unk> world .
We &apos;re not just going to get rid of the <unk> or the <unk> , but also the <unk> of the <unk> that live in the most <unk> Africa .
It &apos;s a kind of a <unk> person , and knowing the light so that I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , I can tell you , &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t tell you , &quot; &quot; which is the violence on women and zeros .
There &apos;s a few of the reasons I &apos;m going to do .
<unk> for all this , this is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the New York City , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the New York <unk> , the
They put them together , so they can tell that women are obese by a prisoner compared to men in favor of God .
A few years ago , 2,000 years ago , I was a sophomore , and I was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the 70 years , and I was going to be able to go back to the <unk> School of every year , and I &apos;m going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m also going to be able to do that , but I &apos;m going to be able to do that in 2000 , and I &apos;m going to be able to do that in 2000 .
So they &apos;re going to have a <unk> , which is , in fact , the women who are going to be brave , and they &apos;re going to be angry , and they &apos;re going to be dead in the classroom when the woman is born in the classroom , and she can &apos;t be able to speak in the room , because you can find a <unk> in the room , and you can find a <unk> in the room , and you can find out that the woman &apos;s going to be able to go out
But you know , it &apos;s something that you want to do is that , you know , they &apos;re going to have a lot of men in a way to send men into more <unk> .
It &apos;s a critical problem because men can be capable of powerful power , for example , when a husband or a woman or a woman would be able to do it .
So why should I be able to pay it for the same thing as a <unk> ?
And that &apos;s why the problem is that we are going to have this problem , which is the <unk> of violence .
In the United States , for example , we &apos;ve had a <unk> increase in the United States , and the people who were in the United States , and they would have been in the <unk> .
One of the 1,000 Americans in the world .
Now , there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be a thousand <unk> in a <unk> .
It &apos;s a huge increase .
For the time I left the house , I &apos;ve got an increase for 800 percent of the women in the hospital .
We are one of the things that we have to do with the planet , which I had in my head , and I had a <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to have a place in one of the things that &apos;s the most ardent of the world .
We &apos;re now in California , and I &apos;m going to spend the other day that I &apos;m going to pay for four dollars per year by 13 people in the <unk> .
I mean , you know .
At this week , the law of this week is a legal law , which is a <unk> law , and it &apos;s not to be able to do it , and it &apos;s not to be able to do it , and it &apos;s the only one who &apos;s going to do with violence on women .
I &apos;m going to be able to panic .
And they &apos;re going to have a <unk> <unk> .
But in the few countries , in many countries , in many countries , in many countries , in many countries , there &apos;s a little girl in her life , and it &apos;s going to be the same thing that &apos;s going to do , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a <unk> element .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> so that a girl can be a girl in a way that a girl can do so that they can &apos;t .
And then , when she was married , it would be like a <unk> <unk> , so that she could be healthy .
It &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s not the law enforcement , but it &apos;s not <unk> .
<unk> , for example , 91 of the women who live in today , who live today , have been tested in this way .
There &apos;s more than 98 percent of women in the world who are going to have so much more than 98 percent .
It &apos;s a <unk> for all women who live in countries .
The other thing is , I mean , one of the big things that I &apos;m saying is that there is nothing to do with my family , and it &apos;s nothing that I &apos;m going to do with my family , and when she gets married or she &apos;s married or she &apos;s married , even when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s married , even when she &apos;s married or she &apos;s married .
It &apos;s going to be a very good thing to do with your family , and as a girl , as a girl , as a girl , a young man who was in her family .
It was not so recent , but we showed that 75 percent of those four women were diagnosed with <unk> or <unk> or 25 percent of the women &apos;s leading women .
The biggest problem that there is in the world in favor of women is slavery , or it &apos;s slavery , it &apos;s a kind of slavery .
About seven million people were born in the middle and 18 months .
30 million people live today in slavery .
In fact , the U.S. Department of United States has been to take every year in order every year , and the <unk> <unk> , and 80 percent of those women are dying of slavery .
In the United States , it &apos;s in that moment , 60,000 people live in the United States or in slavery .
Atlanta , <unk> , where you are sitting in the room where I &apos;m going to be able to get into the <unk> , between 200 and 300 women , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people , people
This is the room of the number one on this .
There &apos;s also a lot of <unk> , and you have a lot of <unk> .
When you look at the <unk> , you want to do that for 1,000 dollars , which is what they can do for 1,000 dollars .
A 16-year-old student , a young woman , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , Wyoming .
So that &apos;s another really bad thing , because there &apos;s no way in the United States , because there &apos;s no way in the United States , but it &apos;s not a good thing to do , but it &apos;s not a good thing to do .
It &apos;s a big thing to do with the <unk> , the women in the world .
So I &apos;m going to have a good approach to this .
For a year , a year ago , an idea of change law , and women are no longer in law , and women are no longer in the law where they are in slavery , but by the <unk> , the <unk> and — ( Applause ) — went down to a decline .
The United States , the United States .
At the same time , there was 25 women in the United States .
Canada , <unk> , I &apos;ve been told , I &apos;ve been talking , <unk> , <unk> and other countries , right now .
It &apos;s one on the right that can be done .
We have two big things in our <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and we &apos;re going to build a system .
<unk> <unk> .
And the kind of thing that I did is tell you that I said that I was going to be in the <unk> — a <unk> .
Only 3,000 years old , and the reason is , the reason is that there is any organization on any organization , and the reason is that there is a <unk> boat , or it &apos;s in the <unk> of my law , and I &apos;m sure what they want , of course , what they want to do , that they don &apos;t want to do that .
This law needs to be exhausting .
It &apos;s going to be a little bit shaky , and it &apos;s now in my book , and it &apos;s in my book , and it &apos;s because of the other things that I &apos;ve been talking about , but because of the other things , it &apos;s also about 89 <unk> in the United States , because it &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s a great personality to protect them from violence .
A <unk> says , on a <unk> campus , because there &apos;s a lot of pressure on campus , if they give someone to someone else , but when they &apos;re sentenced to someone on campus .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
These are the things that are going to be in our own business .
It &apos;s very bad , it &apos;s very serious about the <unk> on the right side of the <unk> , as you know . ( Applause ) And this is the clock .
When I became a <unk> , it was about 39 <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and so forth — ( Applause ) — ( Laughter ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 / 24 hours for the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening now .
If you &apos;ve got 500 companies , we have the 500 and the 500 , and these dragons , I &apos;m going to tell you that we &apos;re going to burn less than the rest of the others .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on in our <unk> .
The other problem with the <unk> <unk> : we are the oldest ones on Earth .
We &apos;re going to be born in the war since World War II .
Our grandparents were on the ground .
And we &apos;re going to get rid of the <unk> , <unk> bombs .
We know , of course , now we have a <unk> .
We were in an era of 25 different challenges , or more than World War II .
For years , I &apos;m not going to be saying , we &apos;re not <unk> — ( Applause ) — we &apos;re not going to be able to complain — ( Applause ) — we don &apos;t know .
But in any case , the things that we have to do is we have these kinds of people who are concerned about violence and the underlying majority of sexual assaults on women .
The other one is the same for the reason , the men , the men , the men .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
A 16-year-old guy who might say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to be able to say , &quot; &quot; I was a little bit like this , when I was small , when I was small , when I was small , when I was a kid , I was very small when I was bored .
<unk> <unk> from <unk> , the end of the war between the <unk> , the war , and the World War II , when it was published to the Declaration of Human Rights .
But for that time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t think they were going to know that they were missing , but they would be humiliated , because they &apos;re going to have the same thing , because it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to exist today , because it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to exist today , because it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to exist today , because it &apos;s the same thing .
Even though they say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , they &apos;re using <unk> .
They &apos;ve been inspired by the self-organizing system , the vast majority of men who have inherited the immune system , the vast majority of the men who are going to live in the world , and the majority of the men who are going to have a big deal .
Are we going to have to do today ?
I would say , well , the best thing that we could do for women to do is to do that , and you know how to do it , and where you are going to be willing , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and that &apos;s what you need to take for granted , to be more willing to finish the world .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m saying in my mind .
But I hope that , after that , the women have focused on their own , on college campuses , on college campuses , and in the future , and in the future , we need to protect our <unk> and <unk> .
I have 12 <unk> , and I &apos;m going to give up my kids and 10 <unk> , and I often think about them , and they &apos;re not only if they were living with the same thing , and I hope that all of you are going to be willing to be brave for women all over the world , and I hope that all of you are right now to become brave .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
When I was in the middle of a cliff , the future seemed to be <unk> .
<unk> growth wasn &apos;t going to stop .
<unk> <unk> was a <unk> .
The cancer of cancer , the <unk> of cancer , is going to be born in front of our lives .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> would be us .
It wasn &apos;t going to be there . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s not there .
And I had a <unk> life for 30 percent .
<unk> <unk> <unk> on two thirds .
There &apos;s a lot of food that &apos;s growing up in the population of the population .
The only thing that I &apos;ve got more excited about , is to be more innovative , by the way , in terms of what &apos;s going on ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To answer this question , you have to figure out how to look at it , and you have to figure out how to deal with your attention , and you have to be able to figure out how to do it .
In other words , you &apos;ve got to understand what sex is sex .
So I want you to imagine that we &apos;ve got to look at how to create this kind of thing , which is to create a <unk> .
For 30,000 generations .
<unk> , it was a few changes , but the app has been published in the skeleton in the next hours .
It &apos;s a <unk> phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
I mean , at that time , on the right hand , on the top five years .
<unk> <unk> is the same thing .
And from the end of the course , I &apos;m going to be able to share some of the things that are going to be dead .
And more than that , with the ideas of ideas — ideas of lasers , ideas , ideas .
They were going to get together in this technology .
And that &apos;s what it is , it &apos;s a <unk> technology , and so I think it &apos;s the key to what &apos;s happening in the world .
The human body is also a brilliant idea : the idea of the idea of the <unk> , the idea of the brain , the idea of the <unk> of the brain , the idea of the <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> together .
How do you look at something like this , or something like that ?
She <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> species , if you put two different pieces in different contexts .
One of the things that &apos;s going to do is to make a difference .
And one of the things that you can do is , in a variety of a sudden , you can find a person who &apos;s going to be able to do this in the same way .
And so this is the same thing that you can do with the individual <unk> innovation of all species .
It &apos;s not a very good thing to do .
What is the same thing that &apos;s going to do with the advent of the Industrial Revolution , which is going to be in my <unk> ?
And I think that the answer is , is that the answer is to be a little bit of something on a different way .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> doesn &apos;t do that .
A culture can be no longer .
Maybe a <unk> culture .
<unk> has a culture .
They &apos;re taught one of the women who were born from parents who were born .
<unk> <unk> .
But the answer is , you know , that is , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t have any <unk> .
So why do you want to prioritize liberal standards ?
The answer is , the answer is , the answer is in 2003 .
And I think it &apos;s an idea in the picture of the 20th century that it has also been translated into the <unk> of the <unk> .
Adam <unk> <unk> for four hours and three hours .
And &quot; &quot; Oz <unk> &quot; &quot; for one hour and two hours later .
Oz is the best for Adam and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> Adam <unk> .
He can do their own <unk> and <unk> .
And the Oz of the Oz , and Adam <unk> two <unk> and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk> two <unk> , and Adam <unk>
It &apos;s going to make a difference for the <unk> , and so forth .
Adam and Oz is on the front of his time .
I mean , you know , as long as long as you should be working , you should be able to work with that , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to work with the book .
When you look at the first , you need to be a little <unk> .
How much do you do that ? There &apos;s a lot of time .
How many of you are going to work on an hour for an hour of an hour , if you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> .
You &apos;ve got seven and a half seconds of yours compared to 1950 .
You &apos;re going to have 15 minutes to look at these numbers on the equivalent of the <unk> .
You should be working for six hours so that you can go on a pedestal , which is an hour for an hour .
So we &apos;ll go back and forth and ask the question to ask , &quot; Who has made them and for whom ? &quot;
<unk> on the right was made for me to do other people .
How much does it do it ?
<unk> ? <unk> ?
You know , I think millions .
I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make a difference for me .
And that &apos;s how the society works .
It &apos;s what we &apos;ve been looking at .
The clock is the clock , when you were married , people literally worked on you .
They &apos;ve done it with a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s going to do it . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And what they did was they were going to be able to do it , and it was in the way that they were born .
<unk> people are going to get into pit <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> , which is going to look at the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and it &apos;s going to give you a good food for the hour after you know , and they &apos;re going to give them a good food for an hour after that .
Think of every other .
In fact , there are other things that work on one .
<unk> is an example .
<unk> is <unk> .
Even though we don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) So , what did these behaviors do ?
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But I don &apos;t have this .
There &apos;s a <unk> working on food .
It &apos;s a <unk> of men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that she &apos;s going to have a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> knows .
And the guy knows that he doesn &apos;t need to be an ally , to make sure .
And everything we need to do is , you know , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and everything that we need to do , is that we need to be <unk> .
It didn &apos;t do that .
They were going to be growing up .
They were very smart .
But there was no sense of what they were doing .
There is no <unk> for women .
<unk> women together with men .
There &apos;s no way to do this , but it &apos;s not the same as a <unk> , because there &apos;s a lot of things that you &apos;ve done about , and the tools that they &apos;ve done , are always taken from the <unk> .
For example , there &apos;s a place where there was a place where there was a <unk> device .
They &apos;ve always been made with a <unk> <unk> .
In the same same way , there &apos;s a whole bunch of people in the same way that you can see in the same way that you can see in the same way that you can see , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the Higgs boson .
When the person started to get into the <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of what they &apos;re talking about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for thousands of years ago in Africa where we look at that , and the other thing we see is that there &apos;s a big distance from the <unk> .
It &apos;s also <unk> — it was like a <unk> , a <unk> , a 200 miles away with a <unk> <unk> .
And that &apos;s what the groups have started to do .
And that &apos;s led to <unk> .
They put them together in a <unk> way , and they do things like <unk> <unk> , and then some of them have a little <unk> .
What &apos;s going on , when you get the people out of the <unk> , from the context of the world ?
The answer is , it &apos;s not just a <unk> <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t even make it in a way .
And this is what &apos;s going on .
<unk> <unk> compared to the people with their own , and they &apos;ve really experienced the <unk> .
And because the population in 4,000 , the population in 4,000 , they had nothing to do with their reproductive skills .
<unk> didn &apos;t happen to the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> .
Going back to asking ourselves , not only who did it do that , but who knew how to do it , but who knew how to do it ?
No one is literally no one .
A person on a <unk> doesn &apos;t know .
I mean , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; because people don &apos;t know how to do it , because people don &apos;t know how to do it , because people don &apos;t know how to do it , because people don &apos;t know how to do it .
And what we &apos;ve done in this is that we &apos;ve made a sense of what we &apos;ve done in the way that we don &apos;t even know .
It &apos;s not the same thing .
But if there is an exponential technology of the technology of the United States .
In fact , in fact , because I &apos;m not going to focus on a level of happiness , or that I &apos;m not going to focus on the social media that other groups are .
It &apos;s not my fault .
It &apos;s a matter of how good people do have their ideas , and how good they do , and how good they are , rather than the moral one .
We &apos;ve created a <unk> brain .
We &apos;re just going to look at the <unk> .
We are neurons neurons .
<unk> ideas , <unk> and <unk> ideas , one of the same <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s not less than less or less .
Now , the future , as we take forward , is that we don &apos;t have any good stuff .
<unk> war , depression , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> things in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also convinced that the way that people are connected to the idea of the idea of the people , and the idea of the idea of being able to get better , and I &apos;m sure that technology will be wrong .
Because in a way , in a way , in a way , in a way , in a way that you can see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
Thank you .
