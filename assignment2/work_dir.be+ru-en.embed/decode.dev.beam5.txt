( Water ) I &apos;m going to get into the <unk> <unk> , and the name is <unk> and the name of the <unk> .
I was born in my family and I was born .
<unk> <unk> was five years old when the death of the father was born .
It wasn &apos;t the same thing , and it wasn &apos;t going to be a little bit shaky , and they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother had 16 children .
With 16 children , only five <unk> <unk> .
Imagine that that was my childhood .
I &apos;m going to bring women out of women who are going to be diagnosed with <unk> , or children who are going to serve the <unk> .
When I went to school , I was going to get a little nervous .
I wanted to be a storyteller to help women and children .
So here I &apos;m going to go to school .
I had no idea , and I wasn &apos;t going to do it , and so I wasn &apos;t going to do it .
And my father sat in a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get into a <unk> .
I &apos;ve done my education .
And while I &apos;m going to get older , I &apos;m going to have a <unk> <unk> .
You know , when I was going to college , I didn &apos;t even know that I was my family with my family , and I had to do that .
<unk> months after months , I didn &apos;t know nothing .
My family was in front of me .
And as I did , I was going to breathe on my family in my family .
I wanted them to live in a <unk> .
Where was my heart ?
The heart was in the barn .
When you look at what &apos;s going on , my heart is my heart , my heart .
I really wanted to go back to my alma mater , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that .
I got a good job .
<unk> is a <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to do that , right now .
If I &apos;m going to do it in a way that I &apos;m going to be able to do this , I &apos;ve seen 4,500 million <unk> .
About 90 percent of them were women and children , and most of them were <unk> , and you know , when I was in my head , I was in my <unk> , and I was in a <unk> <unk> , and I was in a <unk> <unk> , and I was in a <unk> <unk> , and I was in my head .
So I &apos;m going to make some of the things that I &apos;m going to find out of the things that you can &apos;t imagine .
I saw a little bit of a kid with a kid who was crying and crying , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a young woman who couldn &apos;t wait to go to school , not a team of education that was not a place for life .
I &apos;ve seen a lot of my parents and my homes and my homes , and I was able to see my parents and my family , and I was able to see my family and my family , and I was able to see my family and my family .
It was very exciting .
And at that moment , we talk about <unk> .
And at that moment , I was wondering , &quot; What can I do for these people ? &quot;
How can I help them ?
And at that moment , I realized that education changed my life .
She changed me to my status .
And at that moment , I realized that I should be able to encourage the public health professionals and our health , and I started working on work .
What was it that was easy to me ?
It &apos;s not , because at that moment , education is completely ignored .
And because of the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s because it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
And it was a <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Who am I going to do that ?
Would you like to give me a sense of it , not .
That &apos;s why I have to be able to do this , and that &apos;s why I was supposed to do this .
How would I do that ?
I &apos;m going to do a <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> was 80 years old .
It was a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get into it in the <unk> .
And he looked at me and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to be like , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> . How can I be ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> .
So we &apos;ve had 25 schools , and 15,000 children , and 15,000 children , and these schools are extraordinary .
( Applause ) Thank you .
<unk> , we &apos;re working , we &apos;re going to be working , and we &apos;re going to be honest , and we are right now , and we are right for women , right ? We &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , and one day I &apos;m going to tell you .
One day , I was in the office in a <unk> office .
Suddenly , I saw myself in my head , and I had to see my door and my father , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to do that . What do you do ?
You &apos;re going to panic . You know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , you know , your life is your life .
But as a receiver , you have to be authentic .
You have to adjust and empower the strength .
I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
So I got them wrong .
They &apos;re <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> people .
I &apos;m going to put them together , and I &apos;m going to do it .
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , they said , &quot; &quot; they said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not going to happen .
<unk> , their voice , the voice that they were talking to me , really me . I really did .
But I was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ?
What are you going to do here ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them , and I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m just going to look at them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to go down here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is a <unk> .
Yes , we &apos;ve tried some students .
And the Koran says that if you give the Koran for women , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to be able to speak up .
And in this moment , I &apos;m going to get back to them , and I was going to get back to them .
And I had a <unk> , and I had a <unk> .
They &apos;re about three students , and we &apos;re going to have a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
The mother and children .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve got all the things that you can look at .
I was a <unk> . I was going to give you my job .
And one day , four <unk> , one of the things that I was going to do with the Kabul , and I was going to go down to the hills of Kabul .
And I have to go on a pedestal , and they &apos;re going to give us my way .
I &apos;m going to go down to you , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) And my supervisor came out and said , &quot; &quot; I can answer it .
What do you need ?
We have all of them <unk> .
And yet , at the end of the moment , if you &apos;re going to be strong .
You know where you are .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
By the end of the birth , it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
And I went back and I said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to go to you . &quot; &quot; And I went to the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I
I want to leave them in school , and they don &apos;t care more .
All right . No . No .
And I was just an outsider . I had no voice .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; How do I challenge that problem ?
They are in countries for women to get education .
So , I &apos;m going to get a little bit further , and that moment , we &apos;re going to focus on this moment , and at that moment , one of my favorites has been published , and that moment , one of my favorites has been published .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to break it .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What happened ? What happened ? &quot;
But anyway , I don &apos;t want to do that .
You can do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot;
Today , these people — I &apos;m going to do this .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education is going to change people .
When you get older people .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m sure ...
I live in a <unk> , which was a <unk> and <unk> .
I want to share with you .
It was a beautiful <unk> .
We could go to where we wanted .
You know what happened to me ?
Today , people can &apos;t stand out of the house , don &apos;t worry about the <unk> .
But we want to go back to our <unk> .
They &apos;re going to get a lot of them on a pedestal .
So you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
I &apos;d like to share with you to share this with you .
So he told me that compassion and <unk> can be the Universe .
<unk> : <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> , let &apos;s let go .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to ask you , I &apos;m going to be able to do this with a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> on steroids ?
We &apos;ve got a little bit of a dataset .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you a little order .
( Applause ) My <unk> : I &apos;m going to get a couple of people with a couple , like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to do this with three <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to ask you who are all these things .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know how many kids don &apos;t know .
When I realized that it was the ones that don &apos;t do the same thing that I &apos;m going to put on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to be a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and Charles I &apos;ve always been <unk> <unk> .
But by the way , the <unk> of this idea is to create the idea to create an idea called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , &quot; &quot; <unk> ergo &quot; &quot; — I tried to get rid of it , and I got to get rid of it , and I got to get rid of it , and then I got a little bit of it , and I got out of it , and I had a little light on my computer computer ?
Maybe there is a <unk> where they &apos;re going to get together ?
So we &apos;re born with &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
When I was an old scientist , I showed that it showed me how to make a computer computer on the pieces and gave it a <unk> .
So I &apos;ve got a whole bunch of <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to do that , I &apos;m going to get into the language of the <unk> , and now I &apos;m going to be able to imagine this for a moment , and I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
I &apos;m also going to do a new <unk> called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; She &apos;s about bees and other things that are in the world , and why they do it .
If you don &apos;t have the flowers of these <unk> , all the things that we &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to get to the plant , and we &apos;re going to be angry .
So I &apos;m going to use these <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to use these <unk> .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Coughs ) DH : Yeah ! Who else !
We have to <unk> <unk> .
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my favorite ideas from ideas , but what is ideas ?
<unk> can do this .
<unk> is a <unk> and new <unk> .
( Laughter ) Because the world is really the light of the light <unk> .
If you don &apos;t , we wouldn &apos;t be where we were going to be there , wouldn &apos;t it be if it wasn &apos;t going to be true , it would be a culture , it &apos;s not a culture , it &apos;s our own life .
When I was eight years old , I gave my ideas and my ideas called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a foundation for the planet .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to do the same thing , and I &apos;m going to go .
I &apos;m now 13 , and it &apos;s not that I &apos;m going to be 13 , and it &apos;s not that I &apos;m going to get the growth in the world .
All right , I always had a great impact on my own art , and I wanted to shake it for everything that I was doing , and I was doing something I &apos;m doing .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; I had a lot of <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; I had a lot of <unk> .
And I would argue that if I was going to break my head , I &apos;m going to go on the street from the question , &quot; How do you know ? Where are you going ? &quot;
And I thought , well , I thought that I could do that , and I thought , well , that &apos;s what I thought to do .
Because I was only eight years old , and I wasn &apos;t going to do it .
I just knew that I wanted to know that I wanted to know that I was going to be able to tell you , and that I wanted to share with the ones that are less than me in life .
My mom sat me down , and I sat down on my head , and I sat down on my <unk> and I sat down on my head and I snuck in my head with a <unk> , and I was going to be able to do the same thing .
I started to do more <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got this <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to go around the world , and I &apos;ve come from <unk> , <unk> , Australia , <unk> and other countries .
Well , I was going to have to learn so much that I would learn to learn a lot of things , like , like , say , &quot; &quot; Well , you know , you know , there was a lot to learn about how to do it , like , like , say , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s better than worse .
<unk> <unk> started to start .
And one day I was 10 years old , and I was talking about Forbes .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me , and I was going to write about it .
Who am I going to ask , why am I going to <unk> ?
Since I &apos;ve been growing older , I &apos;ve been hard to do a lot of things , and I think that they live .
My parents wound up with me from the ones who were less stressed out , and they were less quiet , and they would be able to go back and forth .
And I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to do that for a piece of cloth , or even the process of making it dangerous for the people and the planet , and I started exploring my research and I realized that even after there &apos;s a problem there &apos;s been a problem for a challenge that I &apos;m going to do .
With a <unk> , a <unk> process , or a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> of the air that gives it a difference for all of the things that they &apos;re going to do .
And so , when I started in my mind , I knew I had the idea of the things that I had , and I knew that I had to be honest , and that 10 to 20 percent of my life had to come up with the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) And I think I think that part of the new kind of thing that we don &apos;t just want to do , but also the <unk> of the world .
I believe that I can take my belief that I &apos;m going to be able to do that , and I &apos;m going to be able to live a lot of life with a better life of life .
We live in a <unk> , and we live in the world , and then I &apos;m more inclined to protect it .
And what happens in the world is that there is nothing in the world , and it &apos;s not enough .
All of you have to go through the heart , because it &apos;s the end of the idea of the <unk> .
And that &apos;s the end of the beauty , and it &apos;s going to look at the light and the ideas of the world .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : Have you heard me , like my parents talking about their parents who are going to have this female women . Where are they ?
If you ask yourself , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be dead .
( Applause )
Here &apos;s a couple of things that you &apos;ve got to do about this .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be able to get a sense of <unk> <unk> , connected to each other .
Most of the things that you see on the screen are not the stars of the stars , but the stars are the stars .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you some of these things , and I &apos;m going to argue that you &apos;re soon saying that you &apos;re going to be surprised that you &apos;re going to be surprised , but more of this , I think that you &apos;re going to find a little bit of a <unk> , and more than that , I think we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
<unk> is the source of the Universe .
And in the same way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to look at it in a way that you can look at them .
I think there &apos;s four main principles that we have to do , and the first kind of thing that &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , what &apos;s going on ?
Okay , so that &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to be on one of the things that we &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s so powerful that the light that is going through it is that the light that comes from it , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And when you really look at that , you &apos;re going to be able to see a little peek around the box .
In order to be able to be able to do this , I don &apos;t want to be able to be able to figure out that I &apos;m going to have one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that can be these systems .
But more of them , they have <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to have the whole system , and if you look at it , we can think of them as a <unk> version of the Universe .
And so on a lot of things that might be more of us , about the root Universe , like , &quot; How do you do this ? &quot;
You can answer these systems .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about .
First of all , these things are very different .
So , if you look at it , you &apos;ve got a little bit of a <unk> , and it &apos;s a whole thing that &apos;s going to do , and then it &apos;s going to be the big thing that &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And what we &apos;re seeing here is , it &apos;s actually a phenomenal light .
And then the question is , if it wasn &apos;t a hint , what does it do ?
And it &apos;s going to be called <unk> gas , gas <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can find a <unk> <unk> .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got to look at the greenhouse gas , and you put them on top of them , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s what it is , but it &apos;s just a little bit of the meaning , but it &apos;s just <unk> .
There are many other parts of the plasma that we &apos;ve been able to do with the plasma , and yet we stopped our own understanding of the physics of physics , and yet we began to think of ourselves , and yet we began to understand the physics of the physics of the physics .
<unk> is a <unk> .
To tell you about this , I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that I &apos;m going to tell you about the fact .
The majority of the Universe is not made with the <unk> .
You &apos;re going to be dead .
Most of the things that we do with something that we call <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is something that is not very good at all , except for the cost of the <unk> , and we have to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re going to be able to do this , you &apos;re wondering what &apos;s going on , you &apos;re wondering what &apos;s going to happen when we do something about each other .
And it &apos;s not the same as a <unk> .
So how can we do that ?
So to answer this question , I &apos;m going to answer a little bit more , &quot; What will be if you &apos;re going to be able to do this ? &quot;
<unk> .
We &apos;re going to figure out what we &apos;re going to have to do , as a result of the Universe from the Universe , just to be diagnosed .
They &apos;re going to get a little bit off with a <unk> , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing in this <unk> .
<unk> is an organic gas , and you can see a lot of <unk> .
And what &apos;s going on here is that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in a very , very <unk> .
And that &apos;s really important , because it means that it &apos;s very , very specific , and it &apos;s hard to look at the lab , and it &apos;s able to do it with something that we can see in the lab .
So , it &apos;s very exciting .
<unk> , why don &apos;t you care about how much it is to teach us how to teach us something about what is the result of the so-called <unk> , the reason why you write about how to teach us how to teach us a very good thing , that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
<unk> is a great thing : physics is pretty good .
Now , the rest of the time that I was going to do with my head .
If there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , it has to be a <unk> energy .
When I cut the ball off the air , I would argue that he &apos;s a <unk> ball .
But I &apos;m not going to argue that it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do with all the things that I &apos;m going to do with it .
So this is the same way that the Universe is going to be the Universe .
They don &apos;t really understand why it is , and it &apos;s going to work on top of it .
They &apos;re going to look at this <unk> <unk> &apos;s name , and they called it the <unk> .
So we &apos;ve got to learn more about this .
And then one final question , the question is , is that the power of the sun is going to look at the Universe from the <unk> ?
And the way that you can do is , it &apos;s a structure that makes a difference in a way that makes a difference .
And the problem in the Universe is in the middle of the universe , which is the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We need something to do .
I &apos;m happy to think about this , and I &apos;ve always been thinking .
For the beauty of the <unk> , the most important thing is , it &apos;s not a model for the most important thing that is the most important thing that &apos;s going on .
An important thing is , to be able to look at an important thing , to try to look at the <unk> <unk> .
So I can learn a lot about the Universe that I could learn so much about the Universe , and the pieces are on the side of it , and those pieces are on the board .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to give my TED Talk , but you can experience yourself a little bit .
What I &apos;m going to do is what I started to do with that , how much would I start thinking about how much it is , and how is it possible ?
Well , for the answer , I &apos;m going to give you a Nigerian Ford Ford , when he asked him to tell her story .
That &apos;s what he said , &quot; &quot; Well , if I &apos;m going to get into the people that they need to do , they would say that they need to have a good deterrent to serve a lot of <unk> .
And this is not a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
They ask for the number of <unk> <unk> .
So we need to be able to do this , and we need to remember , but we also need to remember the innovation , and we also need to remember the things that we are facing in our own field , when we &apos;re doing a little bit backwards , if we &apos;re going to take a step back , if we &apos;re going to jump back .
And to me , the best way to do this is to study the Universe around us . Thank you .

So imagine what you &apos;re going to be on the street in the United States , and you &apos;re going to get a little Japanese and says , &quot; Hey , what &apos;s called this block ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Okay . So what &apos;s called this block ? &quot; &quot; And you said , &quot; &quot; You know , you don &apos;t have the name of it .
There &apos;s a name ; it &apos;s just a little bit of the name ; it &apos;s just a little bit of a difference between the <unk> .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be on the street , and you &apos;re going to go down on the street , you know , you &apos;re going to go on the street , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Hey , what &apos;s the wrong ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is the block block , and this is 16 . This is 16 . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well good , but how is it going to be like this ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s going to say is that the Indus script is called .
There &apos;s a name .
Here &apos;s a website on Google Maps , which is 14 , 16 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 18 , 19 .
In all of these things , there &apos;s a name . It &apos;s just a little bit of a <unk> relationship between the <unk> .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how is you really good , but how do you know your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> says , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s simple : It &apos;s a <unk> .
There &apos;s a block of 17 , a house in a row , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to be dead . &quot; &quot; But I noticed that in the neighborhood , I noticed that in ladies , I noticed that there was no sign on the board when the ladies were born .
The house that was going to be used in front of the first time , the house was home in the room .
The house , which was the <unk> , was the house of the number two .
The house is the house of the number three . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s a <unk> . ( Laughter ) So I &apos;m pretty good at that sometimes , that sometimes we have to go to the second side of the ground to understand something that we even don &apos;t even want to do , and to understand that it is absolutely impossible to understand .
For example , there &apos;s a lot of things that are going to do that is that they &apos;re working in what they &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do .
So every month , if you don &apos;t shave , you &apos;re not going to eat it , but you don &apos;t want to be healthy , because they don &apos;t pay attention to them , because they don &apos;t want to be healthy , because they &apos;re not going to be dead .
( Applause ) You know , you know , every single one of the word &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s three four .
However , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
You can &apos;t do it in a <unk> , but in terms of how they think they think about two , three , four , four times .
And this is also <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> , in fact , is that in every single one that &apos;s talking about <unk> , it &apos;s also a <unk> , which is also a <unk> .
So let &apos;s not worry about whether or at TED , or something else that is not a bad thing to do with you , it &apos;s a little bit of it , it can be a <unk> , it can be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
