( Recording ) I &apos;m going to get into the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
I was born in a family .
<unk> <unk> was five years old when I was born .
<unk> didn &apos;t have been <unk> , but they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother had 16 children .
It &apos;s only 16 children with five children .
Imagine that was my childhood .
I &apos;ve been inspired by women who are willing to be inspired by women , or children who are inspired by the <unk> .
When I went to school , I was going to school .
I wanted to be brave enough to help women and children .
So I went to school .
( Applause ) So I wasn &apos;t going to be a <unk> , and I wasn &apos;t going to panic , so I wasn &apos;t going to do it .
And my father took me into the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to go into the <unk> .
I challenge my education .
So I &apos;m going to panic , I have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know , I wasn &apos;t even aware that I was my family , and I wasn &apos;t even aware that I was born with my family .
<unk> months , years old , but I had no idea .
My family , I was in <unk> .
As soon as I was reading my family , I &apos;m going to get my family .
I wanted them to live in <unk> .
Where was my heart ?
The heart was in the <unk> .
If you look at what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s happening with my heart , my heart of the <unk> .
I really wanted to go back to my alma mater , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that .
I had a good job .
<unk> .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
When I was born , I saw a couple million million <unk> .
About 90 percent of them were women and children , and the majority of them were born , and the majority of the people were born , and you know , when I was in a <unk> <unk> , you know .
I &apos;m going to create the things that I &apos;m going to imagine , if I &apos;m going to make things that you can &apos;t imagine .
I saw a couple of young kids who were crying and crying , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I &apos;ve seen a young woman who wasn &apos;t going to be able to go ahead , didn &apos;t have an education that wasn &apos;t even a place for life .
I &apos;ve seen a lot of my parents &apos; parents and my house , because they were born , they were born .
It was very common .
And at that moment , we speak about a contradiction .
And at that point , I ask myself , &quot; &quot; What can I do for these people ? &quot;
How can I help them help ?
I realized that education was changed my life .
It changed me , my status .
And at that point , I realized that I should give a public education education and the health , and on that , I started working on working .
Would I be comfortable with it ?
It &apos;s not , because at that moment , education is completely different .
And it &apos;s because of the <unk> <unk> .
And he said , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Who are I like this ?
Can I tell you ? I don &apos;t .
So that &apos;s why I &apos;ve had to be inspired by this community .
How did I do that ?
I &apos;m going to <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> .
It was 80 years old .
It was a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to put it in front of him .
And he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to come out of you . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to come up with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to come out of you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to come out of you . &quot; &quot; And he
<unk> in one year , we &apos;ve got 25 schools , and 15,000 children who are in these schools . It &apos;s amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
You know , we &apos;re going to work , we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be born right in women &apos;s right , right , right , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
One day , I was in an office in <unk> .
Suddenly , I saw myself in my head , and I looked at the door , and I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot; &quot; When you look at me , what do you do ?
You &apos;re <unk> . You know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
You know , you know , you &apos;re looking at your life .
But you have to be compassionate .
You have to educate and raise the strength .
I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to panic .
They <unk> . <unk> .
( Laughter ) Very encouraging people .
I picked them up and <unk> .
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , they said it &apos;s not going to happen .
<unk> , the voice , the voice , the voice that they share with me , I &apos;m really excited .
But I was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They asked , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ?
What are you going to do with you ? &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m just looking at them and I &apos;m just looking at them . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And then they got me into the eyes , and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to go there . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a <unk> .
So we put some students together .
And the Koran says that if you ask the Koran of women , you know , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , you don &apos;t know , you know , you don &apos;t want to be able to do it . ( Laughter )
And at that point , I &apos;m going to go back and forth , and so forth , and so forth .
And I had this idea of <unk> <unk> .
Three students are <unk> . We are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother and children .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have all kinds of things that you can imagine .
I was <unk> . I &apos;m going to <unk> my job .
And one of the things that happened was four <unk> , a friend of mine , and I was going to get rid of Kabul .

I said , &quot; &quot; What happens ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I can tell you the answer for her .
What do you need ?
So this time we &apos;re all about <unk> <unk> .
And yet , at least , if you have to be strong .
<unk> where you &apos;re going .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
On birth of birth , it &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> .
I went and they said to me , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to send you to drive . &quot; &quot; I went to the car , sat in the car , sat down .
In order to put them in school , they don &apos;t know what else .
Everyone &apos;s going to go home . No , no .
In fact , I was alone . I had a lost voice .
I thought , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this challenge ?
They have hundreds of thousands of women to improve education .
So I &apos;m going to go back and suddenly — at this moment , we &apos;re going to look at the <unk> — in this moment of one of my favorites , and one of my favorites is one of my favorites .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sakena Sakena ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it .
She said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not what you do . What happened ? &quot;
But anyway , no matter me .
You &apos;re going to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) So you &apos;re going to look at it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what it is .
Today , these people are the best ones .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education is going to change people .
When you get older .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now , the potential of the women , the potential of women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women , women ,
I believe ...
I live in a closet , and it was <unk> .
I want to share with you .
It was a beautiful <unk> .
We could go wherever we wanted .
Do you know what happened to me ?
Today , people are not going to walk out of the house , don &apos;t do it .
But we want to go back to our <unk> .
They &apos;re getting sick and they &apos;re <unk> .
So you can see that , you see , you can see that , you know , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
I want to share with you this .
And what he said is that compassion and what you can see is that compassion and what you can do .
<unk> : What do you do ?
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and so forth with the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to ask you , I &apos;m going to be able to get out of the <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to panic , you know .
<unk> : <unk> ?
We have <unk> data data .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to break your order .
( Applause ) My brother : I &apos;m going to run out of a couple of pairs , as I called <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to have a <unk> in the <unk> of the ages .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you who are these things .
In fact , this is the idea that most kids don &apos;t know .
And as I realized , it was the ones that are the ones that are the ones that I put on the screen , and I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , but I &apos;m not sure if I wasn &apos;t , but it was a lot of fun in my life .
<unk> <unk> and art was always a <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of my computer , I tried to get rid of my computer , and I tried to get rid of it , and what I saw when there was a small light in the center of the computer center ?
Now , maybe there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be able to deal with them ?
And so by born <unk> .
When I was an old age , I showed up a couple of years ago , as a computer computer , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
So I had a team of <unk> .
I &apos;m going to look at what I &apos;m going to look at , and I &apos;m going to look at the language of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to do it in a language that I &apos;m going to do .
I &apos;m also going to make a new <unk> , which is called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about bees and other things that are happening there .
If the flowers don &apos;t do that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to make sure that the plants are removed from the plants , we &apos;re going to be able to eat .
So I &apos;ve been able to use these tools to use these tools to do that .
( Applause ) ( Piano legs ) ( Music ) ( Coughs ) DH : Yeah !
We need to have a <unk> <unk> .
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my assistants know how to change , but what is ideas ?
<unk> can be helpful .
<unk> is <unk> and new .
( Applause ) It &apos;s really the light of the <unk> .
If we don &apos;t have ideas , we wouldn &apos;t be there , and if you don &apos;t have any idea , if you don &apos;t have any kind of art , you wouldn &apos;t be art , it wasn &apos;t going to be art , it wasn &apos;t going to be art .
When I was eight years old , I took my ideas and I put my ideas out of the book , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a foundation for the planet .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to run out of the interior .
I &apos;m now 13 , and though , I &apos;m going to be 13 , and though I &apos;m going to be able to see that I &apos;m going to get a lot more early .
It &apos;s very important for me to have the consequences of art , and I wanted to take it to the whole thing that I do , and I wanted to take it to the whole thing that I do .
<unk> <unk> in the house , and I thought , well , I thought , well , I could do that , if I was going to do that , I had a lot of <unk> shit .
I &apos;m going to tell you that if I &apos;m going to take my <unk> , I &apos;m going to go on the street with the question , &quot; &quot; How do you do that . Where do you do ? &quot;
And I thought , well , that &apos;s what we could do with this and discover that we could be discovered .
Because I was just eight years old , and I wasn &apos;t going to go .
I just knew that I wanted to know that I wanted to know that I wanted to make sure that I wanted to share an outsider , and that I wanted to share with some of the things that I live in life .
My mother picks me up , and I &apos;m going to focus on my niece and I snuck in my head and I snuck in my head on my head , and on my head , and I &apos;m going to make a beeline for each of my knee .
I started to make a more <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> .
Now , my colleague of mine started pouring around in the world , and I &apos;ve got to have a drug of <unk> , <unk> , Australia and other countries .
Well , I &apos;ve been able to learn a lot that I &apos;ve been learning about , a lot of people who are willing to learn , like , like , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to learn how to do the same thing as a parent , and what is more likely to be worse .
<unk> <unk> started .
And one time I was 10 years old with me with a documentary with me .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me , and I &apos;m going to write a little bit of it .
Who am I going to ask for me , why am I going to do this ?
I &apos;ve been obsessed with <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;ve been living in them .
I had my parents caught up with me , and the people who were less stressed out of me , who are less stressed out , and with a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to be able to take this cloth , or even the process of making things dangerous for the people and the planets , and I started my research and I think , even after that , there &apos;s a problem with a solution to what is going on .
And as a result , it would be a <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a little bit of the air that you have to do for all of them , and it &apos;s a <unk> of it .
Because when I started with the <unk> , I knew that all of my intentions , all I had to be aware of , and that you have to be honest , and you have to be honest , and you &apos;ve got to have 20 percent of my life .
( Applause ) I think that I think it &apos;s a part of the new <unk> that we don &apos;t just want to raise money , but we &apos;re going to create a <unk> .
I believe that I could be inspired by my <unk> , <unk> <unk> to live a long life for generations .
We &apos;re going to live in the <unk> , and we live in the world , and from that , I &apos;m still going to protect it .
And what &apos;s happening in the world is that there is not enough .
And you have to move through the heart , because that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to be a <unk> idea .
And this is the essence of the beauty of the world , and the idea of the <unk> , the <unk> .
Thank you , everybody <unk> .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : You &apos;re going to listen to my parents &apos; talk to their parents &apos; parents &apos; &quot; &quot; Where are they going ? &quot;
If you want to ask , you know , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> , you can do it .
( Applause )
Here &apos;s a couple of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be able to be able to look at the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re related to each other .
Most of the things you see on the screen are not the stars of stars , but the stars are stars , or <unk> .
Now , you know , you &apos;ve got some of those kinds of stuff , I &apos;m going to tell you what you &apos;re going to be able to do , I &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be aware that it &apos;s not just a <unk> , but it &apos;s not just that , I think , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; but more of that , I think , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; they <unk> , and they <unk> .
<unk> the source of the Universe of the Universe .
And in the course of &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means that you can look at them .
I think there are four main principles that I think there are four principles , and the first kind of thing that I &apos;m going to say is that there are four main principles that have a <unk> .
In fact , how much ?
All right , so good news is <unk> by one <unk> .
It &apos;s so clear that the light that &apos;s going to flow through it , the light that &apos;s going to be able to move through it , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
And if you really look at it , you &apos;re going to be able to see that you &apos;re going to be able to see <unk> around the <unk> .
You don &apos;t have to be able to do that , in order to be able to do that , which is a little bit more than a friend of mine .
So this is a <unk> , how much can be this system .
But the more of the things that they &apos;ve done is they have <unk> .
They &apos;re looking at the policy system , and when you look at it , we can think of them as a human version of the Universe .
And many of the things that are going to be going to be able to be able to be able to think about the Universe , like , &quot; &quot; How do you work ? &quot;
You can answer these systems .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve said about <unk> <unk> .
First of all , these things are very different .
So if you take a look at what you &apos;re going to do , and you put the whole thing , you know , the whole thing that &apos;s going to be done , and then you &apos;ll see this big , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
And what we &apos;re seeing here is actually a <unk> light .
And then the question is , if that doesn &apos;t know , what &apos;s going on this light ?
And it &apos;s going to be a <unk> gas , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And you can find that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of these <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
So this is something that matters , but it &apos;s just a <unk> .
There &apos;s also a lot of other things to do that , as far as possible for us , and there &apos;s a lot of other things to do with us , and we &apos;ve seen our understanding of our understanding of the underlying particle physics .
<unk> is a <unk> .
To tell you about this , I have to tell you that I &apos;m going to have to tell you that .
Most of the Universe that the Universe did not exist .
You &apos;ve ever heard .
Most of the things that have done is we call a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is something that &apos;s not very good at all , except for the cost , and we &apos;re going to learn more about this .
Now , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re curious what &apos;s going on when we take something to each other .
And that &apos;s not the same thing .
So how can we do that ?
To answer this question , I &apos;m going to answer something different , which is what is going to be , what is going to be like this ?
<unk> .
And we said , &quot; &quot; Well , what we &apos;re saying is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; is just a <unk> version of the Universe .
They are <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at in it .
<unk> is <unk> gas , and you can see a lot of <unk> .
And what &apos;s happening here is that this is a <unk> <unk> , very <unk> .
And it &apos;s really important , because it means that this is a very , very powerful thing that is hard in the lab that you can see in the lab that you can see in the lab that we can see in the lab .
So that &apos;s pretty good .
The question is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; the question is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the reason why it &apos;s going to be able to teach us a lot about what we &apos;re going to do is , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the reason why it is that we &apos;re going to be able to teach ourselves a little bit about what they &apos;re going to do .
<unk> : physics is very good .
And that &apos;s actually going to look at my head .
If there is a little bit more odd , it should be healthy , that should be healthy .
When I got a ball in the air , I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the air that it is .
But I &apos;m not suggesting that it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be able to follow .
So that &apos;s the same way that the Universe is going to make the Universe .
They don &apos;t understand how they &apos;re going to go through all of them .
They are <unk> that <unk> the name , and it &apos;s called it <unk> .
Well , we &apos;ve learned more about this .
Now , the question is , you know , you know , you know , you know , how do you get the energy to the Universe in the Universe ?
It &apos;s based on it , it &apos;s a structure , it &apos;s a structure , it &apos;s less or less .
And the problem is , in fact , the Universe , in fact , is that the Big Bang .
<unk> <unk> .
We need to do it .
I love to think about it , by the way .
To realize that the most important thing is , the most important thing is , is that this is not a part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The most important thing is , when you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I can learn a lot about the Universe from the Universe , and I can learn a lot about the Universe in the universe , and these pieces are on the basis of the <unk> .
<unk> , I &apos;m telling my TED Talk , but you can experience yourself a little bit .
I mean , what I &apos;ve been talking about is what I &apos;ve been talking about , the importance of thinking about the things that I &apos;ve been working on , but how are they using it ?
Well , for the answer , I was inspired by Dr. Ford , when he asked him to ask .
And this is what he said , &quot; &quot; If I &apos;m going to get into the people , what they need to do , they would say that they need a <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> our society .
It &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
They &apos;re asking to be able to multiply the numbers of <unk> .
So we need to go ahead , and we also need to remember the innovation , and we also have to remember the innovation that we &apos;re going to look at , and we also have to remember the innovation that we &apos;re going to do when we take a step back when we get a step back when we &apos;re going to melt .
And by me , the best way to do this is to explore the Universe around us . Thank you .

So imagine that you &apos;re going to look at the street in the street in America , and you &apos;re going to get a Japanese and say , wow , what is this block ?
And you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Well , this is a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Okay , so what &apos;s going to be called this block ? &quot; &quot; You said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s no name .
There &apos;s the name of the names ; it &apos;s just a little bit of it , you know , it &apos;s just a little <unk> between the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he goes , a little bit of it .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and what you &apos;re looking at is what you &apos;re going to do on the street , you know , in the street , you know , you &apos;re going to look at the street , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; Hmm , what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know , this is a block of 17 , but it &apos;s a block of 16 . &quot; &quot; And you said , &quot; &quot; Okay , well , but what &apos;s going to be like this ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s good , but what &apos;s going on ?
There is no name .
Here &apos;s a website in Google Maps .
In all of these things , there is a name for all these names .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Okay , so good , but how do you know your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> says , &quot; &quot; Well , this is simple : this is the <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a block of 17 , the house of the room , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; But I noticed that in the neighborhood , I noticed that in ladies are not running around . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to run through a wide range of stuff . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s going to run around .
The house that was published in a weekly book , is the only door to the house .
The House , the house , was the New York City , the house that was <unk> .
The house is the house of the room . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s easy . &quot; &quot; This is a very nice thing .
Let &apos;s say that there is a lot of people who are arguing about what they &apos;re going to do — you know , your health .
So every month , if you don &apos;t panic , you &apos;re going to get them wrong , and if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not going to do it , because they &apos;re not going to be paid for them , because they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
( Applause ) Almost every single one of them is , &quot; &quot; One is the &quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is , two three four .
But that &apos;s the end of the word &quot; &quot; time , &quot; &quot; which is the end of the sentence , the <unk> <unk> .
You can hear it &apos;s not just in the wrong way , but as they think they think about two , three , four , four times .
And this is also <unk> .
( Laughter ) And that is , in fact , in every single one of the things that you talk about , you know , there &apos;s a character that is also a <unk> .
So let &apos;s not realize that if you &apos;re at TED , or you think about it , whether it &apos;s one of the things that you &apos;re going to do , you can &apos;t be able to do it , it can also be a little bit of it .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
