( Water ) I &apos;m going to get into the <unk> <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter ) The name is <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
I was born in my family and I was born .
<unk> was five years old when she died , but when I was born , I was born .
It wasn &apos;t the same thing , and it wasn &apos;t going to be a little bit shaky , and they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother had 16 children .
With 16 children , only five <unk> <unk> .
Imagine that that was my childhood .
I mean , I &apos;m going to bring women out of the women who are going to pay attention to the kids who were going to pay attention .
When I was going to school , I was going to get a little school .
I wanted to be a storyteller to help women and children .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
I had no idea , and I wasn &apos;t going to do it , and so I wasn &apos;t going to do it .
And my father put me in a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get into a <unk> .
I took my education .
As I do , I &apos;m going to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You know , when I was going to college , I didn &apos;t even know that I was my family with my family , and I had to do that .
<unk> months after months , I didn &apos;t know nothing .
My family was in <unk> .
As soon as I was focused on my family , my family &apos;s family .
I wanted them to live in <unk> .
Where was my heart ?
The heart was in the barn .
If you look at what &apos;s happening in my head , my heart is my heart .
I wanted to go back to my alma mater , but I knew I couldn &apos;t do that .
I got a good job .
<unk> is a <unk> .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
And I &apos;m going to do it in a way that I &apos;m going to be able to do it in a <unk> , and there &apos;s a thousand million <unk> .
About 90 percent of them were women and children , who were women and children , and you know , when I was in <unk> , I was in a <unk> , and you know , when I was in my head , I was in my head .
So I &apos;m going to make a sense of the things that I think you can &apos;t imagine .
I saw a little bit of a kid with a kid who was crying and crying , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a young woman who couldn &apos;t wait to go to school , not a team of education that was not a place for life .
I &apos;ve seen a lot of my parents and my homes and my homes , and I was able to see my parents and my family , and I was able to see my family and my family , and I was able to see my family and my family .
It was very exciting .
And at that moment , we talk about <unk> .
And at that moment , I was wondering , &quot; What can I do for these people ? &quot;
How can I help them ?
And at that moment , I realized that education changed my life .
She changed me to my status .
And at that moment , I realized that I had to give birth to education and our health , and that I started working on work .
Would I be easy for it .
It &apos;s not , because at that moment , education is completely ignored .
And so that &apos;s because of the <unk> <unk> .
And I was wondering , &quot; &quot; I want to do that . &quot; &quot; Who I want to do .
Are you going to get me wrong ?
That &apos;s why I was supposed to be able to do this in this community .
How would I do that ?
I &apos;m going to do a <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;m <unk> .
<unk> was 80 years old .
It was a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get into it in the <unk> .
And he looked at me and he said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; and how can I be ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it with you . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it with you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> .
One year we &apos;ve had 25 schools , and 15,000 children , and 15,000 children in these schools . It &apos;s amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you .
<unk> , we &apos;re working , we &apos;re going to be working , and we &apos;re going to be honest , and we are right now , and we are right now , and we &apos;re talking about the right thing , and I &apos;m going to tell you that one thing I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you .
At one point , I was in the office in a <unk> office .
And all of all I saw , I saw that I was going to be able to tell me how I was going to put my door down to my door , and I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to be wondering what you do ?
You &apos;re <unk> . You know what it is .
You know , you know , your life is your life .
But as a receiver , you have to be a <unk> .
You have to adjust and empower the strength .
I said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
So I got them wrong .
They <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> people .
I &apos;m going to put them together , and I &apos;m going to put them together .
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , they said , &quot; &quot; they said that they weren &apos;t going to die .
<unk> , their voice , the voice that they were talking to me , really me . I really did .
But I was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you going to do ?
What are you going to do here ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them , and I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m just going to look at them . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to go down here . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the <unk> .
So we tried some students .
And the Koran says that when you give the Koran , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they &apos;re going to be able to speak up .
And in this moment , I &apos;m going to get back to them , and I was going to get back to them , and they came back .
( Laughter ) So , I was going to be able to go out of <unk> .
It &apos;s about 3,000 students . We have a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
The mother and children .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
We do all the things that you can look at .
I was a <unk> . I &apos;m going to give you my job .
And one night , one of four <unk> , and I &apos;m going to go down to the hills of Kabul , and <unk> , suddenly we had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to focus on the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to break us .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And my supervisor came out and said , &quot; &quot; I can answer it .
What do you need ?
We &apos;ve all got <unk> .
And yet , at the end of the moment , if you &apos;re going to be strong .
You know where you are .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
By the end of the birth , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And I went back and I said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re going to go to you . &quot; &quot; And I went to the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I sat in the car , and I
I want to leave them in school , and they don &apos;t care more .
All right . No . No .
And I was just an outsider . I had no voice .
I thought , &quot; &quot; What should I do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
There are hundreds of women for women to get education .
So what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to panic and suddenly , at this moment , we &apos;re going to focus on the <unk> — in this moment , one of the things I &apos;ve learned about this is one of my favorites .
She said , &quot; &quot; Sakena ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What happened ? What happened ? &quot;
But anyway , I don &apos;t want to do that .
You break it .
I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot;
Today , these people — my best job .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That &apos;s what education is going to change people .
When you get older people .
( Laughter ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m sure ...
I live in a <unk> and a half .
I want to share with you .
It was a beautiful <unk> .
We could go to where we wanted .
You know what happened to me ?
Today , people can &apos;t stand out of the house , don &apos;t worry about it .
But we want to go back to our <unk> .
They &apos;re going to get rid of them , and they &apos;re going to go on a pedestal .
So you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do .
I &apos;d like to share with you to share this with you .
So he told me that compassion and <unk> are the Universe .
<unk> : <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> , let &apos;s let go .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : I &apos;m going to ask you if I &apos;m willing to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to give you a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ?
We &apos;ve got a little bit of a dataset .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to give you a little order .
( Applause ) My lesson is : I &apos;m going to get a couple of people with a couple , like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to do this with three <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of it .
You know , it &apos;s a <unk> program that most kids don &apos;t know .
When I realized that <unk> is the ones that don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to be a <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and Charles I &apos;ve always been <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> <unk> , the idea of creating the idea to create &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So , &quot; &quot; <unk> ergo &quot; &quot; — I tried to get rid of it , and I got to get rid of it , and I got to get rid of it , and I had a little bit of it , and I got out of it , and then I had thought , what if there was my little light in the middle of the computer ?
Maybe there is a <unk> where they &apos;re going to get together ?
So we &apos;re born &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
When I was an outsider , it showed me how to put a computer on the pieces and gave it a <unk> .
So one of the things that I &apos;ve got to do is , I &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> .
I mean , I &apos;m going to look at the language of the <unk> , and now I &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to imagine the same thing , and I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
I &apos;ve also done a new <unk> called &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s also about bees and other things , and why they do it .
If you don &apos;t have the flowers of these <unk> , all the things that we &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to get to the plant , and we &apos;re going to be angry , you know .
So I &apos;m going to use these <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to use these <unk> .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) ( Coughs ) DH : Whoa !
We have to <unk> <unk> .
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) All of my favorites with ideas , but what is ideas ?
<unk> can do this .
<unk> is new and new <unk> .
( Applause ends ) Because the light is really the light of the <unk> .
If you don &apos;t , we wouldn &apos;t be where we were going to be there , wouldn &apos;t it be like a <unk> or a <unk> , a culture , a culture , a human life .
When I was eight years old , I gave my ideas and my ideas called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; which is a foundation for the planet .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to do the same thing , and I &apos;m going to go .
I &apos;m now 13 , and even though I &apos;m going to be 13 , and it &apos;s not that I &apos;m going to get my growth in a way .
All right on me , I &apos;ve always been fascinated with my own art , and I wanted to shake it all the way that I was doing , and I wanted to shake my own .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; I thought , &quot; &quot; I thought to myself , &quot; &quot; I was able to do that , and I was able to do that , I had so much <unk> .
And I would argue that if I was going to break my brother , I &apos;m going to go on the street from the question , &quot; How do you know ? &quot;
And I thought this was what I thought to do , and I thought that I could do it .
Because I was only eight years old , and I didn &apos;t have it .
I just knew that I wanted to know that I wanted to know that I wanted to share some of the things that I wanted to share , and that I wanted to share with the ones that are less than me .
My mom sat down to me , and I sat down on my <unk> and I snuck in my head on my head , and I snuck in my head on my head , and I was going to be able to do the same thing for every time .
I started to do more <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And I was going to be able to go around the world , and I came across the world , and I came up with <unk> , <unk> , Australia , <unk> and other countries .
Well , I had to do a lot of that , and I had to learn so much that I would learn about how to learn how to do it , for example , as a result , as a result , and to make sure that it &apos;s better or worse .
<unk> <unk> began .
And one time I was 10 years old , I was talking about Forbes .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me and I was going to write about it .
Who &apos;s going to ask me , &quot; &quot; What do I have ? &quot; &quot; What would my mind be ?
Since I &apos;ve been growing older , I don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do with that , and I think that they live .
My parents wound up with me , and my parents wound up with me , who were less stressed out , and I was going to be able to do it .
And I &apos;m going to argue that I &apos;m going to do that for a piece of cloth , or even the process of making it dangerous for the people and the planet , and I started exploring my research and I realized that even after there &apos;s a problem there is a problem for a challenge that I &apos;m going to do .
With a <unk> , a <unk> process , or a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s going to take the air out of the air , and it &apos;s going to be the same for all of them .
And so , when I started in my mind , I knew the things that I had to do , and I knew I was going to have to be honest , and that to 20 percent of my life , I have to be able to make a difference .
( Applause ) I think it &apos;s part of a new way that we don &apos;t want to pay money , but it &apos;s also the <unk> of the world .
I believe that I can take my belief that I &apos;m going to be able to do that , and I &apos;m going to have a lot of money to live with a better life of life .
We live in a <unk> , and we live in the world , and then I &apos;m more inclined to protect it .
<unk> is what happens in the world , and it &apos;s not good .
All of you have to go through the heart , because it &apos;s the end of the idea of the <unk> .
And that &apos;s the end of the universe , and it &apos;s going to look at the light and the ideas of the world .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : Have you heard me , like my parents talking about their parents who are going to get this brave woman . Where are they ?
If you ask yourself , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to be dead .
( Applause )
Here &apos;s a couple of people who are talking about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be able to make a sense of <unk> <unk> , connected to each other .
Most of the things that you can see on the screen is not the size of the stars , but the stars are the stars .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you some of these things , and I &apos;m going to tell you some of these things that you &apos;re going to find , you know , that you &apos;re going to be surprised , you know , that &apos;s not just a joke about it , but more than that , I think we &apos;re going to be able to do that , but more than that , I think we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
<unk> the source of the Universe .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; means that you can look at them on them .
I think there &apos;s four main principles that we have to do , and the first kind of thing that &apos;s going to be called <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
In fact , what &apos;s going on ?
All right , this is one of the things that &apos;s going to take on one of them on behalf of the <unk> .
It &apos;s so powerful that the light that &apos;s going through it is that the light that goes through it , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of it .
And when you really look at it , you &apos;re going to be able to see a little peek around the box .
In order to be able to be able to do this , I don &apos;t want to be able to be able to figure out that I &apos;m going to have one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> that can be these systems .
But more of them , they have a <unk> .
They &apos;re looking at the whole system , and if you look at it , we can think of them as a <unk> version of the Universe .
And in many ways , how many of us are going to be wondering about the Universe , say , &quot; How do you do this ? &quot;
You can answer these systems .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about .
Number two : these things are very specific .
So if you take a look at it , you get the whole thing , and you get the whole light that &apos;s going on , and then you get the whole big thing that &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And what we &apos;re seeing here is that it &apos;s actually a phenomenal light .
And then you ask the question , if that doesn &apos;t work , what does it do ?
And it &apos;s going to be replaced by gas , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can find a <unk> <unk> .
And what you do is , you know , you &apos;ve got to look at the greenhouse gas , and you put them on top of them , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s what it is , but it &apos;s just a little bit of the meaning , but it &apos;s just <unk> .
There are lots of other things that are going to look at the plasma of the plasma , as much as it was made for us , and yet we stopped our own understanding of the physics of physics .
<unk> is a <unk> .
To tell you about this , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the fact .
The majority of the Universe is not made out of <unk> .
You &apos;re going to be dead .
Most of us think of something that we call <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is something that is not very good at all , but it &apos;s not very good at all , except for the cost of it , and we &apos;ve got to learn more about it .
If you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re wondering what &apos;s going on when we do something about each other .
And it &apos;s not the same as a <unk> .
So how can we do that ?
To answer this question , I &apos;m going to answer a little bit more , &quot; What &apos;s going to be if you &apos;re going to be able to do this ? &quot;
<unk> .
And what we &apos;re saying is that we &apos;re going to look at the <unk> , the <unk> of the Universe , just by the <unk> .
They &apos;re going to do a little bit with a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing in this <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> gas , and you can see a lot of <unk> .
And what &apos;s going on here is that it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> in a very , very <unk> .
And that &apos;s really important , because it means that it &apos;s very , very specific , and it &apos;s hard to do that hard in the lab , and it &apos;s able to do something that we can see in the lab .
So , it &apos;s very exciting .
<unk> , why don &apos;t you care about how much it is to teach us how to teach us something about what is the result of the so-called <unk> , the reason why you write about how to teach us how to teach us a very good thing , that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
<unk> is a very good thing .
There was actually going to be a really cool head .
If there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , it has to be profitable .
When I peel the ball from the air , I would argue that he &apos;s a <unk> ball .
But I &apos;m not going to argue that it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do with all the things that I &apos;m going to focus on .
So this is the same way that the Universe is going to be true .
They don &apos;t really understand why it &apos;s going to work with all the cost .
They &apos;re going to look at this <unk> &apos;s name , and they called it the <unk> &apos;s energy .
So we &apos;ve got to learn more about this .
And then one final question that &apos;s going to be , is that what is going to be the energy of the sky in the Universe ?
And the way you can do it is , it &apos;s a structure that makes a difference in a way that makes a difference .
And the problem in the Universe is in the middle of the universe , and that &apos;s what it is .
<unk> <unk> .
We need something to do .
I &apos;m happy to think about this , and I &apos;ve tried to think about it .
For the beauty , the most important thing , the most important thing is , is that it &apos;s not a model for every single one of the Classics .
It &apos;s an important thing to look at , to look at the <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;m able to learn a lot about the Universe that I could learn so much about the Universe , and these pieces are on the side of it , and those pieces are on the board .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to give my speech , but you can experience yourself a little bit .
I mean , you know what I &apos;m going to do with what I &apos;ve done on the basis of how much it is , and it &apos;s a few of them , but how do we use it ?
Well , for the answer to me , I &apos;m going to have a <unk> Ford named Ford when he asked me about her .
That &apos;s what he said , &quot; &quot; Well , if I &apos;m going to get into the people that they need to do , they would say that they need to have a good deterrent to serve a lot of <unk> .
And it &apos;s not the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
They ask the <unk> number of <unk> .
So we need to be able to do this , and we need to remember , but we also need to remember the innovation , and we also need to remember the things that we are facing in our own field , when we look at our own field , when we take a step back when we go forward .
And to me , the best way to do this is to study the Universe around us . Thank you .

So imagine what you &apos;re going to be on the street in the United States , and you &apos;re going to see you &apos;re a Japanese and says , &quot; Hey , what &apos;s called this block ? &quot;
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he says , &quot; &quot; Okay . So what &apos;s called this block ? &quot; &quot; And you said , &quot; &quot; You know , there &apos;s no name .
There &apos;s a name ; it &apos;s just a little bit of the name ; it &apos;s just a little bit of a difference between the <unk> .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be on the street , and you &apos;re going to go down on the street , you know , you &apos;re going to go on the street , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Hey , what &apos;s the wrong ? &quot;
They said , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is the block block , and this is 16 . This is 16 . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Well good , but how is it going to be like this ? &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s going to say is that the Indus script is called .
There &apos;s a name .
Here &apos;s a website on Google Maps , which is 14 , 16 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 18 , 19 .
In all of these things , there &apos;s a name , it &apos;s just a little bit of a human race between the <unk> .
And you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Okay , but how is you really good , but how do you know your <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> says , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s simple : It &apos;s a <unk> .
There &apos;s a block block of the house , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And so I noticed in the neighborhood , I noticed that in ladies , I noticed that in the afternoon , I noticed that there was no sign in ladies .
The house that was going to be published in front of the first one .
The house that was born was a <unk> house in the room .
The house is the house of the number three . It &apos;s simple . It &apos;s a <unk> .
For example , there &apos;s a lot of things that are going to happen in the world that they &apos;re going to do what they &apos;re going to do .
So every month , if you don &apos;t touch them , you &apos;re not going to eat it , but you don &apos;t want to be healthy , because they don &apos;t pay attention to them , because they don &apos;t want to be healthy , because they &apos;re not going to be dead .
( Applause ) You know , you know , you know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is the result , &quot; &quot; which is the result , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re going to have four four .
But the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
You can &apos;t do that , but in fact , it &apos;s not only in the <unk> , but it &apos;s four , four , four times .
And this is also <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , you know , you know , in the same way that I &apos;m talking about , there is a <unk> , which is also <unk> .
So , let &apos;s not worry about whether or at TED , or somewhere else , it &apos;s a little bit less than the idea that you &apos;re going to be able to do , and it &apos;s a little bit of it .
<unk> <unk> .
