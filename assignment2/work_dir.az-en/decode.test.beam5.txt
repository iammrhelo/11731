Now , I &apos;d like to say , because there &apos;s a lot of people who had to be able to do it , because it &apos;s not a lot of people that we have to do it .
So , I &apos;ve been a little bit of the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> that we &apos;ve had to do it .
A few years ago , my father was a few months ago , my father was a few years ago .
I &apos;m going to talk about my life .

And in this <unk> , there &apos;s a few years later , but there &apos;s a few months later , but then they &apos;re not a few years later .
They are all of the <unk> of <unk> .
And so that people who have been <unk> by <unk> , which is a lot of people who have been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and so many people who are all the people who can &apos;t be a lot of people .

I &apos;m going to talk about the <unk> of the end of the <unk> and <unk> , which was a little bit <unk> .
I &apos;d like to talk about a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to see a new new thing , because it &apos;s a new thing .
In the <unk> of <unk> , but we &apos;ve been <unk> , but because it &apos;s <unk> , but we &apos;ve been <unk> for the <unk> , but it was <unk> .
So this is a lot of time , and this is a <unk> , which is a <unk> or <unk> , and you can &apos;t see it .
So , in fact that we had to do it was in the <unk> of my life , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s what we do is ?
And I &apos;m going to say this one of the first time , and I was a half years ago .

It was a <unk> <unk> , and I went to school , who &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to me who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> to me .
And so we can &apos;t see what we can &apos;t see what we can &apos;t see .
And I &apos;ve got a lot of people who have been <unk> in the world , and this is a <unk> .
It was a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> and all the <unk> and all the <unk> .
( Laughter ) Now , it was a <unk> of <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot of people in the world .

This is a <unk> , which is the <unk> of me , this is the <unk> of me .
So , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s a very good good .
And then later , &quot; &quot; Now , &quot; &quot; I was <unk> to me a <unk> <unk> to me and <unk> me to me , and I went to me , and I was a <unk> <unk> for me and I had to tell me my life and I had to me .
So , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> to me , and it &apos;s me .
And when I was a lot of time , and I was a <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> in my world .
In one of the world , the <unk> of the world , and he went to me and my father and my father and my father was a <unk> .

We don &apos;t know what we do .
Well , we &apos;ve got to change the world , and this is a lot of these things that we had to do , and this is the world .
We don &apos;t have a little <unk> , but we don &apos;t have to do it , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t choose them .
Because if if you look at , there &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
You don &apos;t know it .
They didn &apos;t know what we can do in our world .
So , I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> for them .
If I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter )

So , it &apos;s very , it &apos;s very <unk> .
And then , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> that I had a <unk> .
You can &apos;t see this <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
Why ?
We &apos;ve been <unk> .
And if we were <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;ve learned .
We &apos;ve been <unk> .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;ve learned .
This is what we &apos;re going to do , and this is a lot .

But we can &apos;t see what we can &apos;t see , but if if we look at this point , if you look at this point , if you look at this point , we &apos;re <unk> to us .
<unk> .
So , if we look out , we can &apos;t see what it &apos;s — or we can &apos;t see what we can do .
So , I &apos;m going to do it .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
Well , what &apos;s what happened .
So it &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> or <unk> .
And so that we can &apos;t see that we can &apos;t see .
So , there &apos;s a lot of things that we can &apos;t see .
So , &quot; &quot; Well , there is no <unk> to do it .
But if you look at them , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve got to do it .

And we can &apos;t see what we can do .
We don &apos;t see here .
We can &apos;t see that &apos;s the <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m here .
In the first time , I went to the first time , and the first time for me .
I went to school , I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
A few years ago , I &apos;ve been <unk> for a few years ago .

And then , I &apos;ve been <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> .
Now , I was a lot of a few months .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a <unk> .
I &apos;ve been been a <unk> .
So , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .

It &apos;s a lot .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it .
I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;ve been <unk> , and I have to say that I had a lot of people who had a lot .
Well , they &apos;re very much .
( Applause )
In the first time , I &apos;m going to talk about a <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , it was a <unk> <unk> , and it was a lot of time , and it was a lot of time , and it &apos;s a lot of time , and it &apos;s a lot of time .
This is a <unk> , which is <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
But I &apos;m going to say , I was very <unk> , and I was very <unk> , and I was very <unk> , and I was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
But it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , it was a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell you a very <unk> .
<unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know it . It was a <unk> , and it was a <unk> .
Now , I &apos;ve been a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> is <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; .
It was a <unk> .
And then , I &apos;m going to tell you , and I &apos;ve been <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to me to me a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;ve been a lot of time and I was a <unk> , and I had a lot of time and I had a <unk> .
So , for example , I &apos;d like to say , and I was a <unk> <unk> , and I had a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;d like to talk about my life , but I &apos;d like to say , but in my life , I &apos;d like to say , but I &apos;d like to say , but I was a lot of people who I had to work .
I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> , and he was a <unk> .
And when I was <unk> <unk> , because it was a lot of people who had a lot of people who had a <unk> .
<unk> , a little bit of a little bit <unk> . &quot; &quot; Now , a little bit <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to take a little <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to take a <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to take a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> to <unk> , who is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
So , it &apos;s a <unk> , and it was a lot of time , and I went to me and my father and my father and my father and I had my father and my father .
And it &apos;s a <unk> , which is a <unk> to me .
<unk> , <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
For example , I &apos;d like to say , as a <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> , and I went to <unk> the <unk> of my life .
They didn &apos;t know him . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> .
And then , then , then , then , after this , then , I &apos;ve got <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And so it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> . This is a <unk> .
So , if if you look at , if if you look at , if if you look at the same time , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go out to the <unk> of my life , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go out in the world .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> of the world , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , and I was <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
In four years later , I &apos;ve been <unk> .
I &apos;m going to do all of the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> to me , and he said , &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of me , and he was a <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , and I was a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;d like to take the <unk> and the <unk> of the world .
And I &apos;ve been a lot of people who have to work , and they are all of me , but they are all the people , but this is a lot of people who have been <unk> .
So , I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and I had a lot of people who who were never <unk> to me , but I &apos;d like to tell you a <unk> , but I have to tell you a <unk> <unk> that I had to work in my life .
You can &apos;t see it .
And then , I &apos;ve got <unk> , and it &apos;s the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to tell you a lot of people who had a lot of people who I had to do this .
But they were <unk> in <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> to the <unk> of our own <unk> .
I &apos;d like to tell you all about my life , and I &apos;m going to tell you all the one of my life and I &apos;d like to tell you a very small , and I &apos;ve got a lot of people who had the <unk> to <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to tell you a <unk> <unk> that I &apos;ve got to work in my life .
Now , I &apos;m a <unk> and <unk> , and it was a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> that it was .
So , for example , it &apos;s <unk> — I &apos;d like to say to the <unk> — and I &apos;ve got to work out of the <unk> — and I had a lot of time .
I can &apos;t see them .
For example , I &apos;ve been <unk> by the <unk> of my body to create a lot of people who were <unk> for them .
In the <unk> of <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of people who have been <unk> by <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk>
It &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; <unk> .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to tell you a little <unk> : I &apos;d like to tell you a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
And so that I &apos;ve been been a little <unk> , and a lot of people who had been a lot of people who were never <unk> to <unk> , and I had a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; and this is a lot of people who would have to tell you , and this is a lot of time , and this is a lot of time , and this is a lot of time , and this is a lot of time , and this is a lot of time , and this is a lot of time , and this is
So , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to talk about my <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;d say to say I was a <unk> <unk> , and this is a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about a million years ago , and I &apos;ve been <unk> in the three years later , and I was <unk> in the world .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , and I &apos;ve got to do it .
<unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to talk about my life .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not the best <unk> and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not the best <unk> and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
<unk> all , all of these things who have been <unk> , and this is a lot of time , and I &apos;ve been <unk> for this . &quot; &quot; And in the world .
I &apos;d like to tell you a <unk> <unk> for a book , and I &apos;ve been been <unk> for a book , and I had to do it .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the world .
You can &apos;t see the light , and it &apos;s a lot of light .
So , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a lot of things that can &apos;t be .
I was <unk> .
It &apos;s going to do it .
So , I &apos;m going to tell you the <unk> of my self , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> to <unk> , who is not to be the world to be the world .
In the last year , I &apos;ve been <unk> by <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> for a million years ago , and we can &apos;t see a half years ago , and we can &apos;t see it .
You can &apos;t see it as a <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s not a <unk> that we can &apos;t see that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
So , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Well , to the most of the greatest <unk> of the greatest <unk> of <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> to <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
We don &apos;t .
So , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;m going to do it .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do you .
It &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Yes .
( Applause )
I &apos;d like to talk about my life .
But that &apos;s what it is ?
Because , you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But if you &apos;re looking at the <unk> , the first time , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to be a little bit , but I &apos;d like to see a little bit of a little bit , but I &apos;ve got a little bit , because it &apos;s a little <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not .
So that &apos;s what I did .
So , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;m going to talk about .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> .
But it &apos;s a <unk> .
And then , it &apos;s <unk> .
For example , as as as as as as well as well , as well as well , but it &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Because , you know , if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s really , it really really really really .
We have to be a little bit of light .
So , it really really really really important , but this is very simple .
Well , what &apos;s the kind of <unk> that &apos;s <unk> ?
What are you going to do this ?
<unk> ?
<unk> ?
The <unk> is <unk> .
But the world , the world is , the world is <unk> .
Well , what is really really really , and I &apos;m going to show you in the world .
So , it &apos;s a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to tell you a very <unk> , which is a <unk> to <unk> .
I want to tell you a very good .
I &apos;ve been going to be able to see the world , and it &apos;s <unk> . ( Laughter )
But there &apos;s a little bit <unk> , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
Well , we don &apos;t know .
So , in fact , it &apos;s like , because it &apos;s <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> .
And we can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> .
So , this is a lot of these things .
So , I &apos;d like to say , I don &apos;t know , but I don &apos;t know what you can &apos;t see , but they &apos;re not <unk> .
And I really really really really really , because it &apos;s really , because it &apos;s a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to know what I have to do this , and I have to do it for a very <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s a <unk> that we can &apos;t see .
But , it &apos;s a thing .
So , the first first time , I &apos;ve been <unk> .
So , the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> .
And this is that there are two two of two <unk> , which is the same time and <unk> .
But if you look at the time , you know , the other thing , you know , the other thing , you know , the other thing , you know .
So , I &apos;ve been <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that you can &apos;t know it .
It &apos;s another thing .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) You can &apos;t see what it is .
But it &apos;s a lot of these things that we can &apos;t see .
And I think it &apos;s a little bit more <unk> , and this is a <unk> , and this is a <unk> .
But this is a lot .
And so this is a <unk> that we &apos;re looking at this , and it &apos;s a couple of <unk> , and it &apos;s a couple of time , and it &apos;s a couple of time .
For example , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And that &apos;s a lot of people .
In fact , it &apos;s a picture .
And they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> for <unk> to <unk> .
So , there &apos;s a lot of time , I think it &apos;s going to do it .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to do it .
It &apos;s a very good thing .
And in the way , we can see the <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
So , I &apos;ve been all all the time , and that &apos;s the <unk> that we &apos;ve got to work .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Well , you know , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
So , I &apos;d like to say , you have to say , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s more <unk> to the world .
<unk> ?
MS : Well , there &apos;s how we do this ?
The world is going to be able to be able to be able to see the world of the world , but there are more problems of the world that you can &apos;t have the world that we can &apos;t see the world .
MS : What are you ?
What &apos;s how it is ?
How are you going to do this ?
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> . This is the <unk> of <unk> . This is a lot .
Now , I &apos;m going to get to get to the <unk> for the world to get to get to get to the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , or if you can &apos;t see what it &apos;s — or if you can &apos;t see what it &apos;s a little bit about the <unk> , and there &apos;s a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little

And I &apos;ve been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;ve been taken in the Earth , which is a million people who have been <unk> .

It &apos;s not a <unk> story .
It was a little bit <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit , and it &apos;s a little <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> to <unk> , and you &apos;ll take a <unk> of the <unk> , you know how to do this .

Have you ever <unk> in this <unk> , a million years ago , a million people who had been a <unk> .
SL : Yeah . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
SL : The <unk> is <unk> .
So , what &apos;s what I was in the middle of the <unk> and what it was ?
SL : I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it .
I &apos;ve got to talk about the people who have been <unk> by a <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of people who are not going to do it .

SL : The name is <unk> <unk> . It &apos;s not <unk> .
What ?
<unk> : <unk> , we can &apos;t see what it &apos;s .
I &apos;m going to talk about a million years ago , and I &apos;ve got a lot of years ago .
It &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> by the middle of the world , but now , but there &apos;s a lot of it .
I have <unk> <unk> .
If if you look at the middle : the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?

Have you ever <unk> , and you see how to say , &quot; &quot; What are you ?
MS : Well , there &apos;s a lot of question that we can &apos;t know , but the world is that the world .
It &apos;s very simple .
For example , for example , who is a new <unk> to make a new way to make a new way to make a new way to make a new way .
<unk> <unk> , and you can &apos;t see it .
SL : But when you look at a little <unk> , you know , you know , there &apos;s a little <unk> for <unk> .
MS : Well , it &apos;s <unk> .
So , it &apos;s <unk> .
And there &apos;s a lot of people who have been <unk> .
So , as a <unk> , <unk> — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but I don &apos;t know how to do it .

If you look at the <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know it , you know , you know it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ?

Every day I &apos;m going to do it .
It &apos;s not because I &apos;d like to tell you a lot of people .

<unk> .
But it is a <unk> for <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> for the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . And it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not .
For example , there is a lot of light .
If you can &apos;t <unk> , and we can &apos;t see it , and we don &apos;t have to do it .
