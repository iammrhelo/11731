We &apos;ve got a lot of people who are not <unk> to the <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> : ( Laughter ) You can &apos;t see it or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> : And it &apos;s a lot of time .
This is the <unk> of the <unk> of the rain .
( Music ) ( Applause ) .
<unk> . We have a <unk> .
<unk> .
And so , we &apos;re not to do it .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> and people are <unk> .
I &apos;d like to say that I &apos;ve got to <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got to take my own <unk> and <unk> to the world .
And if if you look at the next story , if you want to know what I &apos;ve been <unk> , I &apos;d like to say my life to <unk> .
So , it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
What &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> of <unk> , you can &apos;t see the <unk> of the <unk> , and you can &apos;t see the <unk> , and you can &apos;t see it , and you can &apos;t see it .
<unk> , the <unk> of two <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got to <unk> this .
<unk> , it &apos;s a little bit .
They &apos;re <unk> and <unk> and this is that we &apos;ve got to <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a little bit of the <unk> .
You don &apos;t know it &apos;s that .
<unk> , it &apos;s not that it &apos;s .
So , I &apos;ve got to take the same time , and I &apos;ve got more more than this .
The other thing , the other thing , the <unk> is more , and the more <unk> and the other .
They &apos;re <unk> .
And so that &apos;s a lot of time , because they don &apos;t have to see the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> of the most of people who are the <unk> .
And I thought I have been <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the world and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about my <unk> , and I was <unk> to <unk> this <unk> , and I &apos;m <unk> to <unk> .
And if you look at this , you know , the <unk> of these things are <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
I was very <unk> , and I was a lot of time .
So , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> that we can &apos;t see that &apos;s different or so that &apos;s more important ?
But I &apos;m going to say and the people who are the <unk> and the people who are the <unk> and the people who are very very <unk> .
But the <unk> is the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the world .
But we can &apos;t see how much of these things are , but we don &apos;t have to do it .
So , it &apos;s two that two of two .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So , if you want to know that you can &apos;t be more by the important , but there is a lot of people who are not to be able to see the other things that we &apos;ve got to do .
But if you &apos;re not not like the <unk> , not the <unk> of the <unk> , but you see the <unk> of the <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to know you ?
And I &apos;ve got to take them and <unk> them , and it &apos;s me , and it &apos;s me , and it &apos;s me . I &apos;m going to me . I &apos;m a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> ?
Now , it &apos;s not that people are not only people who are not only people who are not only people .
And the way , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; or you .
And I &apos;m going to see them , and the other thing , and we see the same thing , we see them , and it &apos;s a <unk> , and you can see them , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
And I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> , I &apos;ve been been a lot of fun . It &apos;s not a lot of fun .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
But I &apos;m not <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> percent of the <unk> , and the <unk> has been <unk> .
<unk> , you know , it &apos;s not the two of two , and you can &apos;t see it , and you can &apos;t see it , and you can &apos;t see it .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , right ?
So , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and I &apos;ve been not not only for the <unk> and so that &apos;s not not only be not .
And I &apos;m going to see you all the other things .
What &apos;s the question is , what &apos;s the story about the other thing , but there are some other things that we can &apos;t see .
This is a <unk> that &apos;s two two <unk> .
So , what I want to do you to do this is that ?
So , it &apos;s not the same thing that we can &apos;t see .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What &apos;s the reason you &apos;re going to do ?
And I &apos;ve been <unk> to this <unk> .
They &apos;re not to do it .
But to the most of the <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> .
So , in the same time , we &apos;ve been been <unk> in the world , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> : &quot; &quot; And the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and the <unk> of &quot; &quot; and
( Laughter ) I can &apos;t know what &apos;s the word . &quot; &quot; And we don &apos;t know it .
And I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s a <unk> .
And it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not .
I &apos;ve been <unk> .
What &apos;s what happened in , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> ?
<unk> . They &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the <unk> .
And I &apos;m a <unk> , and it &apos;s not . I &apos;m not , but it &apos;s — it &apos;s not . I &apos;m not going to do it . I &apos;m like to <unk> .
And it was a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and then <unk> out of the <unk> and then <unk> , and then then <unk> after a <unk> , then I have a lot of time .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for me to get a <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , to do to the <unk> to the <unk> to the other that can &apos;t be to make them .
I &apos;m going to get the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not to do it .
<unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And this is the <unk> of <unk> .
And so that &apos;s a <unk> for the <unk> to make them in the world .
And I &apos;m going to see this <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I went to the <unk> , and I went to the <unk> , and I went to the <unk> of the <unk> , and I went to school . &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> , and I went to school . &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve got to work .
I &apos;d like to say my &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get on my <unk> .
And so , as a <unk> , and he &apos;s more . &quot; &quot; And what &apos;s the right ?
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re not not .
They &apos;re <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to do you , and it &apos;s a <unk> , because what &apos;s what is going to be ?
What &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> ?
It &apos;s not a problem .
The thing is the right , the thing is .
That is the only story .
So the <unk> of the <unk> of the universe .
They &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> .
And I think I &apos;m going to know , you can &apos;t see the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a little bit of it .
I &apos;ve got to change my own and I &apos;m going to see .
I &apos;m not .
I &apos;d like to say my <unk> is a <unk> .
I &apos;m going to do you .
I can &apos;t know what it &apos;s . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s a <unk> .

And so that people who had been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It &apos;s a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
<unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> — I was <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;ve been a little bit of my life and <unk> .
I was a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , in my new , I &apos;m going to get the new new new , but I &apos;m not a <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> , but if we &apos;ve been <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> to the most of the most of <unk> , but we &apos;ve got to <unk> the <unk> .
So , we &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> and this is a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
So , I &apos;ve been been to the most of the <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , I was a lot of my life , and I would say to the <unk> , and I would say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not to the <unk> .
The <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
What did we do about what ?
I &apos;m going to tell you this one of the first time , and I was a <unk> for the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the world , and I had to do it .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people .
<unk> , I &apos;ve been a <unk> , and I was a <unk> in my life .
It &apos;s a few story , but I &apos;ve been been to the same , but I &apos;m not to say the same of the world .
The <unk> was a <unk> and <unk> to me , and I &apos;d say to me a <unk> to me who had a <unk> to me to get a <unk> to me .
And so we can &apos;t see the other things that we can &apos;t see , but we can &apos;t see the other .
And I &apos;ve got to the most of the people who was a <unk> of the people and I have to <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a <unk> and <unk> and all the other and all the other <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> of my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a little bit of the most of people who are <unk> .
I &apos;m going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , who was a <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> and my father and a <unk> and a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk> who who had a <unk>
And I &apos;ve got to me , because the <unk> of me , I &apos;ve been <unk> to me and the <unk> of me and the <unk> of me .
And so , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , but if you can &apos;t see how it &apos;s a very good good .
And then , after the <unk> , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; The <unk> of my life and my father was a <unk> to me and my father and my father and my father and I had to me my father and my father and my father and my father and I had to me my father and my father and my father and my father and I had to me .
And I was <unk> , and I was <unk> , and I was <unk> , and I was a <unk> .
And I was a lot of my friend and <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my world , and I was <unk> <unk> in the world .
In a <unk> , <unk> , the world was <unk> and my father and my father and my father and my father was a <unk> .
<unk> , who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and the word &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , you know .
So , what &apos;s not about the other thing that is the only energy .
I &apos;m not my <unk> .
The most of my wife who was a new <unk> to make a new new world .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the same thing ?

I &apos;ve got to tell you , and they are <unk> to the <unk> and they &apos;re not to make them and <unk> them .
The <unk> of the <unk> and we &apos;ve been <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> that we had to get this .
And I &apos;m going to say , as I was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>

He said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; The <unk> . &quot; &quot; The <unk> is <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s a <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s a <unk> ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; The <unk>
&quot; &quot; <unk> , you can &apos;t do it . &quot; &quot; Yes .
He was a <unk> . He was a <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if we &apos;re looking at the most of the world , I &apos;m going to do it .
&quot; &quot; What &apos;s what you want to do about what ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So , how how are you do that ?
I &apos;ve got to talk about my life .
I &apos;m a <unk> .
It &apos;s really really really really , it &apos;s <unk> .
I can &apos;t see what they can &apos;t see .
So , what &apos;s about the gravitational cart ?
What &apos;s how we do it ?
But we &apos;ve got to show about what I &apos;ve had a lot of self , and I &apos;ve been very good , and I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;ve been a lot of time .
I &apos;ve been <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> ?
The most of the most most people who are the best flute .
I &apos;m not just just just the world .
And so , I &apos;m going to do you ?
<unk> ?
I &apos;m not saying I &apos;m going to talk .
I &apos;m not my father who I &apos;m saying .
The other thing that &apos;s the best thing .
He was a <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> or our own <unk> to the <unk> of our own .
If you can &apos;t see , they &apos;re all the <unk> .
And what I &apos;ve got to do about the <unk> of the world , and we see it &apos;s doing it .
You can &apos;t see what it is , we can &apos;t see what the <unk> of the Sun ?
It &apos;s a <unk> .
But there &apos;s a <unk> that there &apos;s a lot of other .
You can &apos;t see a <unk> .
So , it &apos;s a lot of light to do it for us to make it .
You can &apos;t see what I &apos;ve got to take you to get to get to get to get to get .
What are you ?
<unk> to the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first time , and the first
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , who are <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk>
So , it was in English , it was <unk> .
And it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> that I &apos;ve been <unk> with you , you know it , you know it , you know it .
You know , you know , you know , you know that you can &apos;t see that they &apos;re <unk> .
This is a story .
And it &apos;s a simple thing , if you &apos;re not a <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , you can see that the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> .
So , they &apos;re not to make it .
They &apos;re all .
So , they &apos;re <unk> to <unk> , because they &apos;re not a lot of people who are not to get to get their own .
We are more than we are all of the world ?
So , we &apos;ve got to do this , and this is the <unk> that we &apos;ve been all , and this is a lot of people who are all of them .
We have a little bit of our people , but for the people who are not to get to the digital <unk> , but in <unk> and <unk> , and you can see that <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re not a <unk> .
Because if you look at , there &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> or <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t see the <unk> of the <unk> .
They were like to say , we &apos;ve been <unk> to the most of our own world .
So , I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> they &apos;re not to get their own .
If I was in the same , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the <unk> of the word is called &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Have you ever <unk> , right ?
So , how I &apos;m going to do you .
I &apos;ve got to do a <unk> to make a <unk> that &apos;s not not to be a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and our <unk> and our own our own <unk> and our own .
So , we can &apos;t see what we can &apos;t <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And I &apos;m a lot of two or two or three or not to be a or or a bit of a or good .
He was how how we do how to do how we do to do , and how to be a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and
What &apos;s the right ?
Well , you can &apos;t know what it &apos;s like , or you know , it &apos;s not a golf cart ?
So , if I was in the same , I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And if you want to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , you can &apos;t <unk> it .
What are you ?
If you can &apos;t see , it &apos;s not a good <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;m going to get out and the <unk> and <unk> .
And that is that we can &apos;t see that &apos;s a <unk> that we can &apos;t see that .
I &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> , and I have a <unk> <unk> .
I want to ask you to say how what &apos;s what is going ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he went to me and he was a <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Applause ) I &apos;ve got to <unk> my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got to <unk> my <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got to <unk> my <unk>
I &apos;ve <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and how it &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> .
He &apos;s a <unk> ?
<unk> me <unk> me ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a few .
We &apos;ve got to say , because I was a <unk> , and I went to her , and he was a <unk> to me , and I was a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> me , &quot; &quot; he was a <unk> <unk> to me and I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> for my <unk> and <unk> to me . &quot; &quot; And the <unk> of my mother was <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the <unk> of my mother was <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the thing is , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell you . &quot; &quot; And the <unk> of my mother was <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the thing is ,
I &apos;ve been <unk> for my life .
( Applause ) We &apos;ve been <unk> for the <unk> ?
We &apos;ve been <unk> to the <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> for the <unk> to <unk> .
And so , it &apos;s a lot of people who said , &quot; &quot; Why ? Why are you doing ?
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it &apos;s for the <unk> . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
We can &apos;t see that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and we can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; And we can &apos;t see it .
And I &apos;m going to tell you a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to talk about .
We know what we &apos;ve got to do , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> that we had to do it .
It &apos;s like as well as we can &apos;t see our own our own .
So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> , but it &apos;s me to me , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but he was a <unk> .
And so , it &apos;s very , it &apos;s very <unk> .
And then , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , I would say to a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve been a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> of the Sun and the <unk> of the world .
Why ?
We don &apos;t have to <unk> .
If we &apos;re <unk> , we don &apos;t have to be <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> for the same .
It &apos;s a very simple and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be , and it &apos;s a lot of time .
And then , then , I &apos;ve got to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
&quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; and I love .
We don &apos;t know what .
And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; and you can &apos;t say it &apos;s a word . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a better . &quot; &quot; And I thought I &apos;d like to me a little bit of my life . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a better . &quot; &quot; And I thought I &apos;d like to me a little bit of my life . &quot; &quot; And I said

But we can &apos;t see that we &apos;ve been <unk> , we can &apos;t see what we are in our own world , but if we &apos;re <unk> to us , we &apos;re <unk> to us .
I &apos;m going to do it .
If we can &apos;t see what &apos;s the <unk> or <unk> , or the other things , and we can &apos;t see .
I &apos;m going to do you in a <unk> .

So , what &apos;s what we do .
So , it &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> or <unk> .
And that &apos;s the <unk> that we can see that we can see the world .
So , it &apos;s a lot of light that we can &apos;t see .
It &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> to make it . &quot; &quot; So , I &apos;m not to do it .
But they &apos;re not going to be <unk> and <unk> and so that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .

We &apos;re looking at this .
We can &apos;t see that the <unk> of the <unk> .

They &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
And then , after the time , after the time , then , then , after the time , after the time , after the time , and I have been <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the most of the most of people who are <unk> , and then , and then , the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> , not just a <unk> <unk> , not only a <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
And this is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
So , if if you look at the same time , if you look at the same time , I &apos;m going to take a <unk> and <unk> for my life and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
I &apos;ve been <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the world , and I &apos;d like to take my <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the <unk> of the <unk> and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the <unk> and <unk> .
The other thing that &apos;s the <unk> ?
The <unk> of the world is the <unk> of the world , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> , &quot; &quot; I was <unk> .

In three years later , I was a half years later , I was a half years later .
I &apos;ve been <unk> , because I was <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say : my <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m not to be a <unk> .

Now , it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And I &apos;m going to see the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and I was <unk> to the same time and I was in the same .
I &apos;ve been a lot of people who have to do , and they are all the people , but they are all the people who are all me in this .
And I was a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> , but I &apos;d like to say my &quot; &quot; and I had a <unk> <unk> to me and I have to tell you a <unk> <unk> to me and I have to work that I have to work in my life , but I have to tell you a <unk> <unk> that I had to work in my life , but I have to tell you a <unk> <unk> that I had to work in
I &apos;ve got to do it .
And then , I &apos;ve got to take the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and
But they were <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;ve been been to say that I &apos;ve been to tell you , and I was a lot of my self and my self is a <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; and the one of my life is to be a <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to tell you a <unk> <unk> , and I was a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of my life and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> to <unk> , and I &apos;ve got to tell
And I &apos;m going to do it and <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> that it was a <unk> .
In fact , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , I was in the same — and I was going to be in the <unk> — and I was a lot of time and I was a <unk> .
I can &apos;t see them .
The <unk> of <unk> who was not to create a <unk> <unk> to create a <unk> to <unk> to the rest of the world .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and I have to be a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it
It &apos;s a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &quot; &quot; And this was a <unk> .
I &apos;d like to say my &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> in my life , and I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> to me and I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got <unk> , and it &apos;s more , you know , it &apos;s more , but it &apos;s more old , but I &apos;ve been <unk> to the same time and I had to work .
And I &apos;ve been a lot of time and I had a lot of my self and I had a lot of my friend and <unk> , and I was not a lot of my <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
<unk> , <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , and I &apos;m going to be able to get out of the most of the most of people who are <unk> to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;ve been a lot of my life and this is going to be in the world , and this is a lot of time , and I &apos;ve been a lot of my life and this is going to be in the world ,
And I think I &apos;ve been interested in this , I &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> .
I was a half years later , I &apos;ve been a <unk> , and I was a half years later , I was a year . years ago , and I was a <unk> .
And I was a <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> is a <unk> .
They &apos;re going to get to the <unk> and they &apos;re not to make it .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
I &apos;ve been a very good time to the time .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> all , all of these things are all of these things that are all of them and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the way we have to do is , and you see the <unk> of the world , and you see the <unk> of the world , and you see the <unk> of the world , and you see the <unk> of the world , and you see the <unk> of the world , and you see the <unk> of the world , and you
I &apos;ve been <unk> to <unk> for <unk> to a book , and I &apos;ve been been a <unk> to the people who had to be a <unk> to get to help us .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the
So , the other thing , you can see that they &apos;re not a <unk> .
I have a <unk> that I have to do that &apos;s a lot of fun .
I was a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , what &apos;s the most thing .
So , I &apos;m going to tell you a <unk> of my book , and I &apos;d say to say my &quot; &quot; <unk> to <unk> , and you can &apos;t see what the world is to be the world .
And in the middle of the <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> in the world , and we can see in the world , and we can see in the world , and we can see the Earth and <unk> the <unk> of the world , and we can &apos;t see that people who can &apos;t be a <unk> in the world to make the rest of the world , and we can &apos;t see that people who can &apos;t be a <unk> in the world to make the world that we can &apos;t see .
The <unk> of <unk> who are not only the <unk> of the <unk> of the human <unk> to <unk> to the human .
And so , I &apos;m going to be the best of the most of the most of the most of <unk> — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to do it , and I &apos;m going to do it .
I &apos;ve got to <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do you .
<unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s a lot of time .
( Applause )
I &apos;ve been <unk> for my life .
But it &apos;s not that it &apos;s like that ?
Because , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> that you can &apos;t see .
But , I &apos;m going to <unk> , and I &apos;ve been <unk> for the first time to <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to be a little bit , but I &apos;ve been a little bit , but I &apos;ve been a little bit , because I &apos;ve been a little bit of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
But it &apos;s not , it &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s .
So , I &apos;m going to do it .
So , I &apos;m going to do it , and I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to do .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
But it &apos;s a lot of time .
And then , it &apos;s a <unk> .
And so , as a little <unk> — you know — it &apos;s like a <unk> — it &apos;s not a dark matter .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
Because , you know , it &apos;s not really , it really really really , but to be the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
And I have to be a little bit of the <unk> of the world .
So , it really really really really really , but we &apos;ve been <unk> to <unk> .
Well , what &apos;s the kind of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> ?
What &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> ?
<unk> ?
What &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> ?
And they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
But , the world is , how we can &apos;t see what the world is <unk> .
And so , what is really really , it &apos;s going to be in the world .
So , it &apos;s a lot of time .
I &apos;m going to do this very <unk> , and I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m a very good .
I &apos;ve been interested in the world , and it &apos;s a lot of galaxies , and it &apos;s a <unk> . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s like the <unk> of <unk> .
And so , we can &apos;t know that .
So , it &apos;s not the same thing because it &apos;s <unk> , because the <unk> is <unk> .
And the way we can &apos;t see the <unk> .
So , this is a lot of these things that are in the world .
So , I &apos;m going to say , and I think I &apos;m not going to do you , but I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do it , but it &apos;s not the <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s really really , because it &apos;s really , because it &apos;s a lot of time .
I want to have to be a <unk> to have a very <unk> to have to do it .
Now , it &apos;s a <unk> that we can &apos;t see .
But , it &apos;s a thing that &apos;s not .
So , I &apos;ve been been <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
And the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
And this is that there &apos;s two two of two <unk> , and the same thing and the same thing .
But , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the other thing .
And I &apos;ve been <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> ,
This is a different thing .
( Laughter ) So what &apos;s a lot of the question is , and the <unk> of the <unk> , you know , what &apos;s the right .
But , it &apos;s a lot of these things that we &apos;ve got to do , and we see .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit more , and it &apos;s a little bit of the same .
But it &apos;s a lot of time .
And this is a <unk> that we &apos;ve got to see and the planets and the <unk> of the universe and the <unk> of the universe .
So , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
And so , we &apos;re looking at a lot of people .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And so , I &apos;ve been <unk> for <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> .
So , I &apos;m going to see the <unk> of the <unk> , and I think that &apos;s not the same thing .
Every single thing , I &apos;m going to do .
And I &apos;ve got to change the universe .
It &apos;s a very good good .
And the way we &apos;ve got to do , and it &apos;s a <unk> that we can &apos;t see .
So , I &apos;ve been all the same time and the <unk> and the <unk> that we &apos;ve got to <unk> , and the other <unk> and the other .
Thank you .
( Applause )
It &apos;s not : It &apos;s not the <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to say , you have to say , you have to say , you have to say , you have to say , you have to be more <unk> , more than the world , more than the world .
What &apos;s the reason we see ?
<unk> : Well , there &apos;s a lot of what we do ?
And when I &apos;m going to be able to get the world to be a <unk> , and you see that the world is more than the world , but there are more problems that we can &apos;t see the world that we can &apos;t see that &apos;s more than the world , and the world is more than the world , and the world is more than the world , and the world is more than the world , and the world is more than the world , and the world is more than the world , and
What did you do ?
What &apos;s how we do this is going to be <unk> ?
How would you see how we are <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , and this is a lot of <unk> . It &apos;s a lot of people who are in the world .
I &apos;ve been a <unk> to get to the end , to the end , to the end , to the end , the <unk> and <unk> to the kids , and I &apos;d have to take a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , or a <unk> or not the same thing — and it &apos;s not the same thing — it &apos;s a little bit about the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
SL : So , I &apos;ve been a <unk> of the same time .

<unk> : The <unk> is that I &apos;ve been <unk> .
So , I have <unk> <unk> .
And so that &apos;s a lot of people who are <unk> , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
And I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> — and I &apos;m <unk> , and I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s , but we don &apos;t know what we can &apos;t do .

If you <unk> , I &apos;m <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> to the <unk> .
And I &apos;ve been very <unk> , because the <unk> is to <unk> , and the <unk> of our own <unk> , <unk> to <unk> .
I &apos;ve got to <unk> in my life in my world , and the world was in the world .
I &apos;m not going to be able to get the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .

And I &apos;ve got a little bit of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .

But it &apos;s just a lot of two two things that I &apos;ve been <unk> .

I &apos;m going to tell you all the world .
And how we can &apos;t see how they are not , and how they are not the right .

And this is the <unk> : &quot; &quot; The <unk> is to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got to <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And the <unk> is to <unk> . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;re <unk> to the <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
The other thing we &apos;ve got .

It was a <unk> and <unk> and my father and my father and my father .
But I have <unk> <unk> .
And then , and I &apos;ve been <unk> and <unk> into the first time , and then the first time after <unk> , and then the first time after the first time , and I had to do it .
So , I &apos;m going to see the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not to say the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .

I &apos;d like to say my <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> .
