( Arab Arabic ) I &apos;m looking for the Algho , the name of Algama , and the name of Algama , the eternal and the heart .
I was born in my family and the median departments .
It was five years old when he died , but when I was born , I was born .
It wasn &apos;t an outsider , they had to go to school .
That &apos;s why I was so lucky .
My mother was born 16 children .
And 16 kids were only five .
Imagine a child who was born .
The night , I saw women who had been exposed to parents , or kids who were willing to know .
When I finished the middle school , I got the middle school .
I wanted to be a firm , to help a woman .
So I finished school .
I was sorry , my country has not been the Internet for a girl . So I was in a slow college , but I couldn &apos;t do it .
And my father passed me in America .
I traveled to America .
I finished my education .
And where I was learning , I &apos;ve had a country called a political war .
You know , when I was a teacher , I didn &apos;t even know what was my family and my country .
It was months , years old , and I had no idea .
My family was in refugee camps .
As soon as I finished learning , I was dragging my family in America .
I wanted them to live safe .
Was it my heart ?
My heart was in Africa .
When I saw what happens from my country , my heart was my heart , my heart was dead .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but I knew that I couldn &apos;t do that .
I could good work .
And then you put a teacher in school .
And here I &apos;m going to go to the camp .
When I went to the back of the camp in the Pactor , I saw that there were a million millions of people &apos; underwear .
A 90 percent of them were women , and the majority of men were born , and the majority of men were born , and they said , &quot; &quot; You know , when I was in the &apos; 70s , I was in the camps .
When I said to ask questions , I knew things that you can &apos;t imagine .
I saw five children who sat in and crying , and she didn &apos;t know what to do .
I saw a young woman who couldn &apos;t have been there , and I couldn &apos;t have education , and I wasn &apos;t even learning that there was even a room for life .
I saw a young boy who had my parents and my parents , and they were my parents , and they were my parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they had their parents , and they
It was a very good thing .
At the end of that moment , we &apos;re going to do the bottom .
And the moment I asked myself , &quot; &quot; What can I do for these people ?
How do I help it ?
At this point , I realized that education had changed my life .
It changed me , given me status .
At the same time , I realized that I had to give her mother education and wellness , and I started working on this .
I was reading what was easy ?
Not because at that time , education was a little girl .
And because Ramananan in Africa , it was an Africa called Africa .
I was going to go and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Hmm . I want to do this .
Have been told to me ? Don &apos;t .
That &apos;s why I had to be able to build the strength of this community .
How did I do that ?
I was asking the questions and I was looking for .
I was going to run .
I was 80 years old .
He was mumbo .
I went to him from the refugee camps .
He looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; Wow , a woman &apos;s dream . How do I be teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make a teacher with you . &quot; &quot; And I said to him , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to wear a teacher with you . &quot; &quot; And when I started from it , the news is , the news about this .
For one year , we had 25 schools , and 15,000 children who have these schools , and that &apos;s been shocked .
( Applause ) Thank you .
We work , we work in teachers , and we make sure that we are right , and we are asking women , and we are asking for women who are human beings , who are the ideas that are human , and we &apos;re legal .
I was in an office in Peonononé , Pacan .
And then I saw how I &apos;m going to get my friends with my lips and I read the door to my mouth , and I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , oh , oh , hi ! What do you do ?
You &apos;re brown . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know what your life is .
But as a psychologist , you have to be male .
You need to fly and do it .
I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ?
Because I was invited to .
They were arrested .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) Thank you people .
I &apos;ve got to put them together , and I offer them medications .
They said , they said to them , they didn &apos;t stop .
And it was a little bit of a tone , a voice that they talk to me , and I was a half old , and I was a half .
But I was dead , I was dead .
They said , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
What do you do here ? &quot; &quot; You know , I just looked at them — ( Laughter ) And they looked at me , and they said , &quot; You &apos;re going to put them there . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to put them there .
Yes , we bring some students together .
And the Koran says that if you put the Koran in a woman &apos;s mouth , ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And then they started to speak up .
And at that moment , I suggested to them , and they went back and forth , and they started to laugh .
The teacher stops coming up .
Three students who have failed , and we kept selling .
They &apos;ve been able to read their customers .
They had a mother and children .
They &apos;ve been exposed to health care .
We &apos;ve been asking all the other things that you can imagine .
I was happy . I was lucky .
There &apos;s four thirds , one ana , and I went to the east of Kabul .
They &apos;ve been on the beaches , and they &apos;ve driven us up .
And I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; My brother went down and he said , &quot; &quot; I can tell you it .
What do you need ?
This time , we all know .
And yet , this is a moment where we have to be strong .
You &apos;re going to run out .
( Laughter )
( Laughter )
From the moment of birth , it is to focus on the hardware and to heal .
I went and they said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you be ready . &quot; &quot; I went to the car .
To put them in school , they don &apos;t think they &apos;re doing it .
They went to home . None of them stayed .
I was just an assistant . I lost my voice .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; What should we do ? &quot; &quot; How do I solve this problem ?
They had hundreds of women to get education .
So I &apos;m going to sit down , and at this point , we &apos;re talking about the following — at this moment , one of my great presentations in a called , at this moment , one of my great presentations in this called .
And she said , &quot; &quot; Sacramento ? &quot; &quot; I said to her .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not what you &apos;re . What happened ? &quot;
But anyway , it wasn &apos;t going to kill me .
You &apos;re going to help them . &quot; &quot; And they went out and forth .
And I said , you know , I said that I would find a teacher .
Today , these people are my best third .
And ... ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
It &apos;s learning that education is going to serve people .
If you &apos;re learning people .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The potential for women was women women women . ( Laughter )
I believe ...
I live in a country that &apos;s not good and good .
Let me just share with you .
It was an countries in the country .
We could look , the chickens wanted .
You know what happened to my country ?
Today , people can &apos;t walk out of the house , and they don &apos;t have to put them safe .
But we &apos;re going to go back to our old Africa .
They get their mouth and they &apos;re learning their own .
So , you see , this is going to be going on .
Let me share this with you this .
He said that compassion and love can lead the Universe .
The word is , Chad &apos;s desire ?
( Audio : Hmm , let &apos;s zoom in .
And the key : The right , the right , is that the title of the best part of the word , the rumps of the beholder , of the beholder , of the Kanduic Kandute , the OCD of the Cotute Kandute , and the rate of the exhalal of the cops from the military .
Quicker : I &apos;m going to take a look at the Internet , and I &apos;m going to write a little bit of it .
KB : Anyone on the chair ?
We &apos;ve got a lot of money .
Quicker : Spanananan-book , &quot; &quot; Dettoes , &quot; &quot; and the boy .
SB : It &apos;s probably best .
I &apos;m going to be able to play your order .
( Applause ) My Peden : I &apos;m a picture of a couple of things that I &apos;ve learned in my mouth , and I &apos;m a picture of a cartoon , and I &apos;m going to see a cartoon with a couple of years old .
And I learned that this was the same thing .
Pah , the phone , they shared a program about professionals that most people don &apos;t know .
Now , when I realized that this was the kind of thing that I &apos;d like to see on the screen , I said , &quot; &quot; I want to be an actor . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m going to be angry . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , I said it was , or myself , but it was a huge moment of my life .
It was the same as a professional and art , and it was always her favorite .
But the curiosity of the computer was born with the idea of creating an illusion of &quot; &quot; The Beautiful Lost &quot; &quot; — ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Mystery &quot; &quot; to my campus , I tried to try and figure out , and what if we had a little bit of light in the inside ?
So there &apos;s a lot where they &apos;re going to serve , where they &apos;re going to serve themselves ?
So you &apos;ve been born in the world .
When I was four years old , my dad told me how to get a computer to the part of a piece of music .
So I &apos;ve got to have a computer technology .
And I &apos;m going to have the first page on the table of HML , and now I &apos;m going to pray for JR &apos;s time .
I also develop a new scientist , and it &apos;s about bees , and it &apos;s about bees , and it &apos;s about honeybees .
If they didn &apos;t yet pollinate these kinds of things , it &apos;s all the things that we &apos;re going to wear from the plants , and we had a little bit of a voice .
So I decided to use these files and make them work with a super-superhero .
( Applause ) ( Music ends ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Anay : Anesters : Astust : Anekapa ! Hmm .
We need to get rid of the Arcus .
( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
And the idea is that it &apos;s going to be inspiring .
Now , the idea is that it &apos;s going to be about development and new research .
And because of the idea of the reality , the whole world is melting .
Now , if we don &apos;t know , we would not be there , where we &apos;re not going to be there , but it would not be the technology of the technology , the culture , the culture , of our life .
When I was eight years old , I took my idea , and I opened up the book , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s about Mathare . &quot;
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to produce an AK-47 and an actor .
I &apos;m 13 now , and even though I was in the summer of 200 , my mother , my mother , was a little bit earlier .
I always had a passion for my passion , and I wanted to be able to help him , and I wanted to be able to put him on my behalf .
You know , a piece of a piece of cloth in the house , and I thought to myself , if I could do that , I had a little bit of this kind of stuff .
And I had noticed that when I was growing up , I was going to stopped saying , &quot; &quot; How do I do this ? Where should I be ? &quot;
And I thought , well , that could be able to do it , and I thought that I could do it with this .
Because I was only eight years old , and I was in a special way that I wasn &apos;t .
I just knew what I wanted to do with the privilege of saying that I wanted to share my way , and what I wanted to share with you was less than me in life .
My mother taught me to expand , and I was in front of my house , and I was playing with the tape , and I had a title called it for every one of my favorites .
And I started to make more expressed more expressed , like shaky feet and coat hangers .
A few of my will would be able to get around the world around the world , and I &apos;ve got a few weeks to the clinic with David and Iran and Canada and in other countries .
I mean , I had a lot of learning about how , like , I &apos;ve been going to learn how to think about leadership , like , a fashion name , and how do you think about the advice of the advice and looking at what is best or worse .
A little mag started .
And one day , when I was 10 years old , I was going to start with the Forbes two days .
( Laughter ) They wanted to write about me , and I made my job .
So a lot of people ask me , why am I going to be an organic ?
On the short stage , I &apos;ve been very excited about the environment , and that &apos;s what we live in .
My parents told me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to share with some of the things that I &apos;m going to share with you , I &apos;m less likely to lose , and with the mind of the environment .
I learned that it would be a way to paint in a way that &apos;s not safe for the people and the planet , and I started my research research , and I &apos;ve learned that even after that , there was a problem for the environment that was not sure what to do with it .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
It takes wind , you can see it &apos;s in order for all and the other people who are breathing .
Because when I started with my mother , I knew two things : all I would have had to be an organic , and that &apos;s that I should be an organic , and that &apos;s that I should be able to be the local and the surrogate .
( Applause ) I think , I think , I think we &apos;ve got a lot of new innovators that don &apos;t just want to make money , but it &apos;s the resilience of the Universe .
I believe that I could ask my dad , who is the future of the future of generations of the future .
We live in a large and healthy world , and from that I &apos;m going to even more rent to it .
It doesn &apos;t matter what it looks like in the universe , and it &apos;s not enough .
You have to have your heart , because that &apos;s what you do , because that &apos;s what the idea is .
It &apos;s also going to power and invention the world , and that &apos;s what the reality is .
Thank you so much and happy .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Pat Mitchell : You know , when I was talking about my parents talking about the list of my parents who had a list of other women . Where are they going ?
If the boy and the lady who &apos;s crying , you might be yours .
( Applause )
Here &apos;s a few of them .
It &apos;s not the same thing as it is .
They &apos;re going to change these kinds of big vocal voices .
Most of the coat that you see on the screen is not only the only stars , but a handful of names .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you some of these things , and I &apos;m going to tell you that what you &apos;re going to do is I &apos;m going to tell you what you &apos;re going to see , that &apos;s not just the usual thing , but more than that , I think , I think , &quot; &quot; Relutive voices , &quot; &quot; they say , and they &apos;re useful .
It &apos;s just like the source of the universe in the universe .
And in their own lab , you know , we don &apos;t have an appliance for an experiment that you can put on them .
I think there &apos;s four main stories that want to tell us , and the first one is that it &apos;s not a big deal .
In fact , how big is it ?
Okay , so this is a very good idea .
But there &apos;s so much , but it goes through it , and it comes out of it , and it seems to be able to fade away from it , and it looks like it &apos;s going to be the same .
And when you really look at it , you can see that you can see the circles around the world .
In order to do that , you can &apos;t be able to see that we &apos;re going to have more than a billion more than one billion .
It &apos;s just as powerful as possible as possible .
But more of them , they have a six-sensor .
They &apos;re going to exist , and if you will , we can think about them as a unified version of the Universe .
And so on a lot of questions that we can think of the universe , like , &quot; &quot; How do you build a rake ? &quot;
You can answer these systems .
So this is what we &apos;ve said about this incredible mystery .
The other one is these things that are very garage .
So , when you take a look at the core of the head , and it &apos;s going to take all of the things that fit in , then it &apos;s going to be a big , good , bloodshed .
It &apos;s not just the wheel .
And what we &apos;re seeing here is , this is really the Granny Cloud .
And then the question is , if this is not a box , what does it take ?
And it &apos;s going to be a gas sport , it &apos;s a gas that &apos;s a billion of the stuff that &apos;s really good .
And the reason that you can do this is to find a little bit of a little bit of the slide .
Now , these are the most powerful areas of this system , and it gives them great savings rate , and the optimism rate , and the optimism — it &apos;s a great test .
This is the most important thing , but it &apos;s just science .
There &apos;s also a lot of other kinds of things that are going to be like this , and it &apos;s also going to kill us , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not the most powerful understanding of the other body .
We need to be learning very low .
To tell you about that , I have to tell you about this , I &apos;ve got to tell you about the tour of the way .
Most of the world &apos;s world has not been done .
And you &apos;ve got this guy .
Most of the time you have to eat something that we call dark materials .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s not very good working with women , but it &apos;s not very good , but it &apos;s not very good , but it &apos;s going to be going to be more about it .
If you &apos;re curious about the physics of physics , you &apos;re interested in what happens when we focus on something .
And it &apos;s not the same thing .
So how can we do this ?
In order to answer this question , I &apos;m going to answer three other things : &quot; What will be going to be when you &apos;re going to touch ? &quot;
Take a look at this .
We remember that we &apos;re going to be able to share a range of the Universe with the Universe , just the size of the universe .
They &apos;re very different , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing in this room , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing in this room .
So this is a garage of gas , and it &apos;s not the same thing , you can see a lot .
And what &apos;s happening here is that , in fact , it &apos;s a very large number of speakers in a very , very large scale .
And that &apos;s really important because it means that it means that it means that it &apos;s very , very small , very small , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of something that you can see in the lab .
So this is really fun .
And what we &apos;ve learned is that we can teach ourselves about what we do about what we do about what is common , and the reason why we can tell us about what we do about physics is that they can teach us about physics , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re seeing .
The main thing is , physics is really weird .
It &apos;s actually going to figure out what &apos;s going on .
If there is nothing else to do , it should be dark energy .
When I walk down the air and I expect it to improve the coal .
But I don &apos;t expect it to be able to hang on to the other side of the planet .
So , in the way , the words of the Universe tell us why the universe is finite .
They don &apos;t understand why they &apos;re getting out of a lot of money .
They don &apos;t give it to the name of the name and calling it dark energy .
Again , we want to understand more about this .
Now , one of the things that &apos;s going to do is , in a way , a question that is , how powerful energy is , how powerful energy is in the universe ?
And in the way , it might be able to do it in a way that you can do a little more or a day .
And the problem of the universe in a large mind is that it &apos;s going to sleep in the wrong way .
Take a look at software .
We need to do it .
I love to think about it , by using analogy .
To understand , as a receiver , the most important thing is not a model of the place of every small piece of a stick , which is a good thing .
The more important thing is , you &apos;re going to look at two more chapters .
So I can learn a lot about the Universe , and I can learn a lot about the Universe , and this is one of the big things that we have in common , and these parts are the core .
And I &apos;m going to end up with my TED Talk , but you can feel the kind of shame you can feel .
So what I &apos;ve started with is how much useful about the core of my head , and I told you a few of that , but how do they actually use it ?
So , for example , I want to take my mouth to Henry Ford , when he tried to be arrested .
This is what he said , &quot; &quot; Well , if I was trying to tell people what they need , what they need is , they said , &quot; &quot; Well , the best thing we need to do is that they need a strong cycle .
And it &apos;s not clear .
They &apos;re not the fastest horse .
They require incredible numbers of science .
So what we need to do is , we need to focus , but we also have to remember about innovation , invention , inspiring — this kind of thing in front of us , as we &apos;re going to do a little bit of the way that we &apos;re going to make a baby ?
And I have a better way to do this — studying the Universe around us . Thank you .
( Applause )
So imagine what you &apos;re looking at in America in the United States , and you &apos;re going to come up with a couple of guys saying , &quot; Oh , a minute , what is this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; Oh , oh , this is Oldot . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what Elvis is .
It &apos;s just a little bit of spam , and it &apos;s a little girl . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Well , what the blocks of this block look like ? &quot; &quot; You said , &quot; &quot; You know , blogs don &apos;t have a name .
And they have a name ; blogs are just a little bit of the world between the people . &quot; &quot; He goes , &quot; &quot; He goes , &quot; &quot; it goes , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a little bit of it .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do now , and you &apos;re going to have a little bit in the park where you &apos;re going to live in the park , and you &apos;re wondering , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of this ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , this is 17 , and that &apos;s the block of 16 . &quot; &quot; And you answer , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s 16 . &quot; &quot; And then you say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s good , but what do you do with this ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not good , but what does this ?
They have a name .
Here &apos;s Google Mules . There &apos;s 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 17 , 19 , 19 .
And all of these blogs is called , and a lot of these blogs is just a nameless between blogs .
And you said , &quot; &quot; Well , good , but how do you know your clothes ? &quot; &quot; One says , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s eight .
It &apos;s got to be 17 , a house of a single one , and you say , &quot; &quot; Faiza . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) You know , Faiza . ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not the case for a paragraph .
The house that was built in front of the ship was being built in the book , which is the door of a single one .
The house that was built was built by two .
We &apos;ve got to be a house of three . It &apos;s just a house of three . It &apos;s clear .
Here &apos;s for example , in Kenya , there &apos;s doctors who believed that they &apos;re going to make your health .
So every month , if you don &apos;t brush , you &apos;re flat , and if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t want to pay for it , because they don &apos;t want to be willing to pay for their job . They &apos;re rich , rather than when you &apos;re stressed out .
( Applause ) Every one of the music musicians , &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; is a long time , beginning of music .
In North America , this is the end of the phrase , followed by the British African music .
You can &apos;t just hear it , but in fact , how they count music , two , three , four times .
And this is also true .
( Laughter ) Now , you can see that in every one of the things that you tell about India is that there &apos;s a lot of tension in India .
So let &apos;s not forget that if you don &apos;t forget that , you know , you &apos;re not even going to have the wrong idea that the idea is , you know , it &apos;s not that you &apos;re hearing , it &apos;s too hard to be .
It &apos;s a little tatauga .
