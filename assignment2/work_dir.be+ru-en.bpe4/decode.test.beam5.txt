Yes , this year on the planet will be about a billion people that are using it .
They &apos;re giving them what they &apos;re going to die .
And yet , this is a great idea , but I think it &apos;s a great thing about the things that you can see .
The first thing I thought about this is , after I thought about this , I was going to talk about it after a friend of Dan Sofa , who died from cancer .
And he said to her family and friends to write a tan that was published after his death .
This is what he said at the beginning .
He said , &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s where I &apos;m going to die , and it &apos;s my past .
I mean , I mean , I mean , as soon as I put it away from my mouth and my family , my family and a friend of mine , a couple of days of the flow of the message I &apos;ve been writing , which is the first part of my book in an art book . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s nothing like a magazine , and a lot of the time that you think of it today , it &apos;s all the things that we &apos;ve seen in the world that are very different from what
It &apos;s going to grow up .
Today , 48 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube .
It &apos;s about 200 million .
A hundred weeks uses Facebook to be able to get 90 to the next month .
If you think about your parents or your grandparents , and the best time they &apos;ve created , they &apos;ve created a couple of images or two or two or a star that &apos;s living in a hidden universe .
But today , we &apos;re creating incredibly rich , and we &apos;re going to live in a way that we don &apos;t know how long it is .
I think that it creates an incredibly powerful opportunity for a pregnancy .
For clarity , I &apos;m a magazine , not the test , because I would like to make sure that the reality and the future is going to be like this .
We &apos;ve seen some of the things that we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to be able to make sure that we &apos;re going to have an expert in the lab and we &apos;re going to eat and eat in the safari nets .
One of them is , pretty soon , I found myself in the New York Times in the New York Times Magazine .
( Recording ) Adam Adam .
Mormon : Adam ?
And so .
Morbiting : Death can eat you anywhere in the room , even by Argangsta .
CA : OK ?
Moru : Pagon.91 : &#91; &quot; &quot; When I &apos;m going to die , &quot; &quot; until I was dead .
( Laughter ) CA : Janine sleep , or not , right ?
And what you do with this is something that makes some sense of things like this , and it gives you a piece of music or a video that can be translated into Facebook .
The other heart of the world is about 1,000 wishes .
It &apos;s available online , and it &apos;s going to be able to look at it , and it &apos;s a story that they can play with , and the stories they can play with , and the stories they can play .
But it &apos;s only an interesting thing .
Many of you may have heard about Dan Rome , who was in the safari video that he was in the safari book , as he said to him .
I think , in fact , the way that I think is that the ability to make a difference is to take a digital fashion , and to develop the great idea of the data , and it becomes an opportunity to develop the value of the entire life , and it &apos;s a lot of science that we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to grow a lot of shit .
And I think , as I think it &apos;s going to be like this , for our digital agnostic , it &apos;s going to be able to do the connections that we &apos;ve created , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re born , and the ability of the idea of the purpose that we &apos;ve created , and the ability of technology to make it worthwhile .
Now we look at a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s such a service — my Nye Toys , and it &apos;s a little bit of a pack of notes , everything you &apos;ve got , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
So , as you can see , it can be kind of cathartic .
Imagine something like something that looks like five or 20 or 20 or 20 years old .
A little bit of the way to front of you , the health of the lab , the computer works on the top that they can relate to people .
And if you can interact with a lot of science in a certain way , you know , a hundred thousands of people are the only one that a person has ever lived .
So , you have the hashtag , you know , when I was in the United States in 2008 , when he was in the United States in 2008 , when he was in the front of CNN called W.I.I.s to the Internet from Anasota Carewell .
And what if we could use this technology for a moment to make sure that we have a lot of our dreams in a sense that they &apos;ve created , and that &apos;s what they &apos;ve created until they lived ?
And I think that it &apos;s a very powerful thing to do , so much as we do about data , and the technology of the data that &apos;s going to be able to make sure that it &apos;s possible in helium .
So the outcome , I think , is that we should be willing to think that it becomes a real truth ? &quot; &quot; And if that &apos;s what it means to be about to be alive and what we &apos;re going to do .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You know , you &apos;ve got a little bit of your mind .
The first one is from Jean-Kai Clock .
The other thing is , from the head of the head , you &apos;re going to get rid of your head .
We actually understand more about the emergence of the reality .
I &apos;m sorry to answer these questions .
They &apos;re going to rise .
It &apos;s a piece of reality that you want to understand .
And then you can make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to test them .
We have to have to be able to get rid of the underlying forces of the Universe .
And so these systems are going to take a cup of coffee , a dense fish , a colony of fish .
The Church that these systems are hard to realize in mathematics .
What about complexity ?
It &apos;s kind of the kind of thing that makes it look like , and it &apos;s going to make a difference .
And we tried to understand the system that &apos;s why it is and how to do it .
And we &apos;re going to figure this out .
You know , you know , you know , it doesn &apos;t make a sense of their feet .
It &apos;s a complex network .
But why isn &apos;t the economic world ?
Where do you apply this ?
We &apos;re going to have a lot of money .
And I &apos;m sorry , I have a percent of an act in terms of engagement .
Similarly , there is a measurement that defines meaning .
You might think that someone had never seen before .
&quot; How do they do this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to serve a sari ? &quot;
or Sidney , TU .
These are companies that work in more than half countries , and there are 2,000 of them .
There was a mountain of debt and debt , and there was a coal net , where 2,000 of them are going .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of them .
And in the middle , it &apos;s funding structures .
But they only count 95 percent of the power of the world , but they &apos;re releasing 95 percent of the power of the world .
But the question is , how do you think about who we are ?
How do you do things like that .
So I &apos;ll tell you a couple of technologies .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s the way that we &apos;re going to get it right now .
These are the basic 737 acres , and these are the basic 737 acres of the basic 737 , and these are the basic 737 acres , and these are the backbone of 737 acres , and these are the basic 737 acres , and these are the basic 737 acres of the basic 737 , and these are the basic 737 acres of the basic 737 .
I follow a few of the rules of the rules .
You know , it &apos;s exceedingly likely , it &apos;s exceedingly likely .
Two days , you know , I want to talk about what is in the way that we &apos;re going to do .
It doesn &apos;t really exist , when we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know what about you , but if I imagine this type of metal , I &apos;m going to see a picture of a picture — just like a man walking in front of the line , and he stops in the front of the head .
And I imagine that this is because it &apos;s not going to take it .
Palh is dead and uncompetitive .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s happening with us without our budget .
I &apos;m a writer and a teacher in English , which means I mean , I &apos;m going to make a lot of love .
You can tell me , and I wanted to feel like this , and I would like to feel that a lot of a bit of metal that we live in order to talk about food — to be a challenge .
So we fall in .
We eat .
We &apos;re going to do it .
We &apos;re going to panic .
We &apos;re going to eat the smells .
It doesn &apos;t make us crazy , and it makes us sick .
Our service is going to cover it .
So , our cruise , our metaphysical , makes sure that we do something about domestic violence or disease .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s like this .
And they share us as a parent , and they &apos;re going to threaten us .
My love is &quot; &quot; Transal , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; The word &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; word &quot; &quot; — and when you look at that word , you can see what it means , and you &apos;re going to see what it means , and it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it means that it
In a single part , there is 16 saving at the word &quot; &quot; The Strait &quot; &quot; — that &apos;s in the Bama , that &apos;s in the front of the world .
( Laughter ) We live in the words that we want to talk about , which is what we &apos;re going to do . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So how did this happen ?
How were we going to get to the identity of the idea of a big food and waste ?
And why do we talk about this kind of good experience , how do we do this ?
It &apos;s hard , but I have a few theories of theories .
And in order to make that , I want to urge you to be able to bite into one of the most creative metal , which is the essence of the mechanism .
Now , when I first started studying a vocal title , I would have been singing these kinds of metaphysical worlds .
In the history of the world , the world of the rich monks , who put it in a sense of a hormone disease .
Here &apos;s a few examples .
William Schweer : It &apos;s just a crazy word , &quot; &quot; Game of Thrones , &quot; &quot; which is always crazy .
&quot; &quot; Look at me , look at me , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to look at my mouth , I &apos;m going to look at my mouth &quot; &quot; — the Roma Bakt Baakt . ( Laughter )
For the first time , I was in the last 20 years , and that was pretty awkward relationships .
It was a few years ago , because it had been published for me a few years ago , because it was very high in the middle of a few weeks ago , and so this was very high .
I remember one moment .
I was sitting in the shower in North America in North America , and I saw myself walking in front of the door .
It was almost literally closed , and we were getting arrested , and when we came back to our dad , he left his stuff in the basement , and then he left her .
Now , I don &apos;t remember that , I don &apos;t remember very , very quickly , as I saw it .
I was 22 , and it was my first tour in the country , and it turns out I was a whole bunch of things .
A week later , I knew the name of my house , and I knew the name of the city , and the name of the city that I had was to be worn in order to do , and I wasn &apos;t going to panic , and I wasn &apos;t going to panic , as I was doing .
I didn &apos;t have a break , and it wasn &apos;t very small , and I didn &apos;t know the underlying truth .
Someone more bold for me could be used as a moment , but I was suspended .
I just sat there .
And then she started crying .
But despite my dad , some little voice in my head thinking , &quot; &quot; Wow . It was the dragon .
I really do the same thing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because most of the most popular part of my life , I wish I had a confusion in my mouth .
Now , this is a genius for me , but in 22 years , I &apos;ve been striving to have the toughest nomads , and that &apos;s quite amazing , but I thought it wasn &apos;t like a parent , a little boy who &apos;s just like me left .
I think , in a certain extent , I wish I would be able to be a little girl , because I thought that it wasn &apos;t and it works .
It &apos;s really not supposed to be odd , but it &apos;s meant to be the fact that there &apos;s eight to the Sheena , 14 songs , two songs , two albums of the name of the &quot; &quot; Wagner . &quot; &quot; A few hours later .
We &apos;ve been dead .
It &apos;s a real man . &quot; &quot; I just waited that I wasn &apos;t going to be like crazy .
But I would say , &quot; &quot; Oh , like my marriage , &quot; &quot; I mean , it wasn &apos;t very good for me to do it .
But I think this is not very unusual .
Most of us feel a little bit of a little girl in the early days .
In fact , there is a tracking that is a lack of shame , because , in a sense , it makes sense , and it makes sense , it &apos;s not that easy , and it &apos;s not so easy .
It &apos;s really true .
This is a tracking unit of 1999 , and it uses an ultrasound to make sure that there &apos;s a lot of other people in order to make sure that they &apos;re going to have a variety of other people in a variety of ways .
( Laughter ) So , in fact , it &apos;s also related to a combination of seasonal infections and depression .
So there &apos;s a couple of evidence that &apos;s not going to be related to the changes of our mood and our behavior .
And the other thing that &apos;s going to do is that most of the relationships begins in this way .
Based on the idea that there is nothing to do with this idea that it &apos;s going to be connected to this idea , as somebody else has a voice in their head .
And most of us feel like this , when the first time is strong .
It &apos;s usually about a few months ago .
When I came back from my trip to North America , I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and I spent a lot of time in my bedroom , and
I decided that if I had my friends , I couldn &apos;t understand a lot of it .
And so I &apos;ve learned to be more about most of them .
And that was probably the fastest year in my life .
But I think , I think , I feel that it was my job , because I was my job , and I would be able to tell you how powerful I was in his basement .
And when I could tell it , then we would end up in the end .
It &apos;s a real crazy thing , because there &apos;s no such thing as a unified theory , that &apos;s a big deal of learning , and we &apos;re talking about the same thing .
Our experiences and our cultural focus , and culturally .
Our species says , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not good , an actor , an act of learning , and it &apos;s not good enough to recognize that the mechanism in our mother &apos;s mouth , and she believes that the mechanism is wrong , when you &apos;re growing up , a certain kind of thing .
In fact , you &apos;ve heard about this — you know , you &apos;ve heard about this , you know , you &apos;re talking about something that you &apos;re talking about , and you &apos;re going to live in a way that you don &apos;t know .
( Laughter ) And our culture uses a fashion to paint and giving it to the idea of the mechanism .
It &apos;s in this case , in a way that we &apos;re going to do a lot of metal , and there &apos;s a crazy thing .
It &apos;s kind of a little bit of a little bit of a call .
It &apos;s not nice and sometimes , and we &apos;re talking about it through our hopes and stories , and we &apos;re telling them that we are going to get us to our hopes and stories , and we &apos;re going to make our dreams and our dreams .
It &apos;s what &apos;s happening in a culture that &apos;s going to be alive , and it &apos;s going to remind us .
It &apos;s like we &apos;re going to have a crazy dream , and we &apos;re going to be willing to live life .
It &apos;s dead sleep .
( Laughter ) To use it , we need to change our culture , whether we change our senses .
Imagine that we all would be less likely to be in touch .
If we were more confident , more open to new , more open , more , more , more , old , and then rather than going to be able to go .
I know that this is a lot where I &apos;m not the first person , but I &apos;m not the first person to describe it .
And in the book , the metaphor of what we live in a book called &quot; &quot; Stephen Johnson , &quot; &quot; and George McJohnson suggested that the reason why we need to guide our own metaphysical .
They &apos;re going to serve , and they can do it as a team of our future , as a result that fits together .
Johnson and Liz &apos;s offering a new metal suit : Kabul is not like this .
I love this way that I love this way .
The lawyers have said that the equations follow , that , in fact , , is that there &apos;s a way to see all of the sudden , and there &apos;s a way to be able to follow the bridge .
And Johnson and Liz and Liz says , all the way , what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s going to serve a lot of people in the face of the great act of a human being , and it shows , a computer , a million .
Now , these ideas have great cultural applications in a long term , but they also work well in other ways — the short term , of course , the kinds of things that are very different in the relationships — the short term , the kinds of equations that you have with a lot more complicated ideas of the experience of the experience of a dream .
So if the mechanism is not , is that it &apos;s a kind of a self-fulfilling experience , and it &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s going to do .
It &apos;s not an accurate story , a sense of creativity , and it doesn &apos;t need a lot of humility , and it doesn &apos;t need a lot of shame .
And it doesn &apos;t make a sense of the body and the dog .
On the top , every experience , every experience of the furniture .
When I was a young man , I never thought that I wasn &apos;t going to make sure that he was going to make a dream .
When a Saudi lady , the first time I met — or when she was a Saudi , I couldn &apos;t be able to name Rai , and she had four days ago , and she had not been crying .
Where is it ?
She &apos;s suffering .
Right ?
And as a way to attack , at the time of a minute , a couple of things are going on , and it &apos;s not dead .
And he was alive , he was just chased from the city .
I realize that Veronica &apos;s 16 years old in the United States of America , but when I read this book , it &apos;s also 14 years old , and when I read this email , I was in 14 years old .
It &apos;s not how something that I &apos;m creating with , which is what I &apos;m creating , which is what I &apos;m creating , not what I &apos;m going to do with my mother or my years , and it &apos;s a total force for me .
But it &apos;s still hard .
It &apos;s not very good at the time of getting rid of it , and if I feel bitter , I should remind myself , and when I feel bitter , I should be like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do this .
It &apos;s also easy .
But this is a lot of better than a second , and it &apos;s a little bit more crazy .
Now , this is the version of a dream or a parent .
Instead , it requires us to mentor a partner with a partner and figure out how it &apos;s going to be hard , but in fact , it &apos;s really hard , but in fact , it &apos;s a very , very powerful learning .
Because you need to be thinking about ourselves , and you can think about yourself in these relationships , and we start thinking that you can do something that you can offer .
Now , this is the idea of something that tells us things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not good enough to work with the teachers . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not for us .
Because , &quot; &quot; These relationships were karate , how I was crying , but it was really great . &quot; &quot; The good part was , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a great thing . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the creator of your art is good , that he &apos;s not going to write .
Now , this is the idea of the idea of how it will be .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So in &apos; 95 in &apos; 95 , I had a friend of mine who jumped on the car from the city to the Panyles , which is the city of Rama Island , and in the city of Portland .
You know how it &apos;s where it is , when you &apos;re young and so concrete — we haven &apos;t left any of any of the national parks , a lot of the time , a lot of the world .
When I came back , I was going to come back to my friends , and I said , &quot; &quot; I got to my friends , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a couple of miles away .
&quot; What is it for a character that &apos;s everywhere ? &quot;
She &apos;s got a boat on his forehead .
It &apos;s going to go to the first place to get it right now .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; You know , you know , these days , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s just a few days , and it &apos;s going to be laughing , because finally , it seems to me , because it turns out that it &apos;s just a few days .
That &apos;s me .
( Laughter ) So this shows the character of the character for writing . ( Laughter )
Now , in the last five years , I &apos;ve seen a lot about this situation — why we sometimes have a little bit of the conversation , and how we feel , and how we do it , when it doesn &apos;t touch , and that we &apos;ll be able to make sure that we have human beings .
Now , I &apos;ve spent the last five years from the last five years old .
I mean , I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of an outsider , but there &apos;s a big shift in the world .
( Laughter ) In fact , most of us would be willing to draw away from the idea of their own childhood , or a child , and not to think about empowerment .
It &apos;s an amazing thing .
We realize that sometimes every single thing is wrong .
We are human beings , we don &apos;t want to be wrong .
But when I &apos;m going to do this , at this point , I have this time , I think , at this point , I &apos;ve got this time in this time , and there &apos;s a lot of abstract views about the human being , and I can &apos;t imagine that wrong .
What &apos;s interesting about this is that we live in this data .
They &apos;re going to meet in a meeting , and they don &apos;t have access to their mouths , and they can &apos;t help us .
In fact , there is a lot of people in the world that we &apos;re all holding in without belief that we &apos;re always going to be wrong .
And that &apos;s me the problem .
In my view , it &apos;s a problem as much as each of us , in a personal life , and we all live together as a society .
What I want to do today is , this is what we &apos;re going to do today , because we &apos;re going to have a sense of it .
Secondly , that &apos;s why the challenge is problematic .
And finally , I want to convince you that maybe I &apos;ll be able to work with a lot of this idea , and when you get it to yourself , it &apos;s the best one of all of the bars in the marathon , the wisdom and the creativity that you can do .
So we &apos;re going to have a sense of parenting ?
It &apos;s going to have a sense of failure .
Would you say , you know , you &apos;re going to be here , and there are no emotion here , when you &apos;re not right ?
Atheism . Naniness .
( Recording ) ( Music ) ( Music ) Oh .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of fun , but they answer the other question .
And you answer the question , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s the feeling that we &apos;re not doing , you &apos;re not very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not good .
( Laughter ) Now , recognizing that we don &apos;t want to feel wrong , and yet , the whole thing is , not ?
For example , you might be fearless , or the feeling that we feel , or even the feeling that I &apos;m wearing , or some of the things I &apos;m wearing .
But it &apos;s not the same as an emotion of emotion .
This is an analogy here .
You know , you &apos;re going to find a cartoon of the United Kingdom of the United States , but not just to throw it off a hour , but rather than having to do with it ?
And what they &apos;re doing is that there is nothing to do with this country , and it seems that she &apos;s going to take a boat off , and she &apos;s going to get rid of the cliff , and she &apos;s going to touch it .
But every single one of the beans is the rock right now .
What &apos;s really funny , especially when you only six years old , is that it &apos;s not the same thing .
It &apos;s just continuing to run until you cut it down , and it doesn &apos;t understand what the dog is going to do .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
When we say something wrong , not when we understand what we &apos;re wrong , and yes , we &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; Oh , we &apos;re like this kind of stuff , and then we &apos;re going to have a rock .
Now , you &apos;ve been wrong , we &apos;ve been wrong , we &apos;re going to have a lot of sense , but we still feel confident on the ground .
I &apos;ve got to do the best thing I said .
There &apos;s a sense of humiliation in the presence of life .
( Laughter ) And because of this powerful thing , we &apos;re in our eyes when we don &apos;t engage in our senses .
I &apos;m going to make that wrong .
Most of us , we don &apos;t have a sense of the mechanism , which is the death penalty , when we don &apos;t unless we called it .
There &apos;s another reason for why we &apos;re learning about this , and it &apos;s more about the culture .
Imagine a little baby school .
You &apos;re sitting in a parent and a teacher &apos;s office .
Now , this is not my own .
( Laughter ) So you &apos;re in the middle school , and you know that you think about it , you think , you think , you think about it .
He &apos;s lagged , and he &apos;s never going to make the house .
So , another nine years old , you know , you &apos;ve learned that , in fact , those who are wrong , they &apos;re not going to be wrong , they &apos;re not going to be wrong .
We &apos;re learning that the good news is very little .
Most of us , and as I think , it &apos;s also going to be true , and it &apos;s going to be a good thing to do with it , by the way , by the other hand , by the other .
Are he going to run a hole in the field , and he &apos;s in the field of physics , right ?
( Laughter ) As it turns out , you &apos;re all kind of holes , the physics and the marathon .
Houses will be .
It &apos;s not only when we do something that we may not be wrong .
Because thinking in this direction , when we make a mistake , we do something wrong , that something is wrong .
Because we are pushing on our own , because we feel smart , we feel that we &apos;re wrong , and we &apos;re giving birth .
Let me tell you a story about rejection .
A few years ago , the name of the name of the poet World War II is a woman &apos;s name .
And you &apos;re not going to be in the homeless .
This has been published in the United States , and it &apos;s one of the most countries in the country .
And women jumped into an accredited form .
The one who had a drug called a drug surgeon , the surgeon over the shoulder , then he pulls her into her shoulder .
The idea was going to come up with a firm .
It looks like this , looking at me and saying , &quot; &quot; Why am I going not to look at the bars ? &quot; &quot; And the thing is , the surgeon has done this , because the surgeon has done a surrogate stamp on it , rather than the right title .
When the story of this story came out of the book , he said something really fascinating .
And so , &quot; &quot; Pah , &quot; &quot; the reason why not the surgeon felt that he was working on the right side . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Why do I think about it , it &apos;s because I believe that you &apos;re based on the right side of somebody , maybe as dangerous .
It &apos;s about giving us a sense of our careers that we all feel , and we don &apos;t recognize it as a single girl in the world .
And when we look at our behavior , we don &apos;t even think about empowerment , and we &apos;re doing the things that are wrong , and we &apos;re doing the deafness of 760 million species in Minneapolis .
It &apos;s a huge problem for the right .
But it &apos;s also a huge problem for society .
Think about it in a minute that you think about it .
What it means is that your knowledge of your focus is a real reality .
And this is a little problem , and it &apos;s about explaining the people in the world that are pretty good .
So , most of us , most of us explaining to ourselves in a way that most of us are using other people from other kinds of people .
The first thing that we think when we think about is that we don &apos;t know that they don &apos;t recognize the data .
They don &apos;t have any access to information that you have , and if you do that information with them , they &apos;re going to have a little bit of it , and they &apos;re going to go in your feet .
If it doesn &apos;t matter if it doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s just the same thing with us , but we &apos;re going to have the same thing with us , and we &apos;re going to fight the other side of the conversation — that &apos;s what they do .
( Laughter ) And they all need to make sure that they all need a piece of coat hangers , and they don &apos;t get it .
And when it doesn &apos;t work , when we realize that people are not angry , they are the ones that are concerned about , and they &apos;re quite smart , we &apos;re going to shift the third question , and they know the truth , but for their own , they know the truth , but for their own own , they know the truth .
It &apos;s a disaster .
It doesn &apos;t give us a sense of how it doesn &apos;t make sense of the truth , especially when it &apos;s defending , and it &apos;s going to turn us into each other .
What I do is , I think , I think , is that it &apos;s the fact that it becomes something that makes it worthwhile to come from our humanity .
It &apos;s like , we believe that our minds are our minds , these are these kinds of things that we can see , and we can see that we &apos;re going to be able to see that we &apos;re going to be able to make a ring of shit .
And what we &apos;re going to do is we need all the things that we &apos;ve seen before , and we saw exactly the same thing .
It &apos;s not true , and if it was , it would be incredibly powerful .
It &apos;s not that we can see the world that we can see the world .
It &apos;s the fact that we can see light not as much as it is .
We can be concerned about the future , and we can imagine that we are other people in other places .
It &apos;s because each of the things that you see , we can look at the top of the sky , and we can see it , and that &apos;s it .
It &apos;s because we are wrong .
Over 1200 years , as David said , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh , I am wrong , and I know that I know it is . &quot;
It was realized that the fact that most of us should be wrong is that it &apos;s not an illusion of infection , but it &apos;s not an unmanageable idea .
It &apos;s a new one .
Because we don &apos;t , we don &apos;t really know that in this world .
And unlike other animals , we try to make that light up .
I think that this is the destruction , and it &apos;s going to take a lot of productivity and creativity .
I began to listen to a lot of this , and I started to listen to a lot of this in the program called &quot; &quot; The Lost World &quot; &quot; to society .
I listen , listen , listen , feeling , and she started to feel that all the stories are wrong .
I thought , &quot; &quot; Danit .
Now , I &apos;m always going crazy as crazy as a boy .
It &apos;s everywhere everywhere . &quot; &quot; The story was .
But as many months later , I &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to take the Internet in a pocket in a pocket of a computer called an iPod .
I hope that I should have this idea , and he said to me , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really what I do .
And it &apos;s given that the founders of the program are even warm , that it &apos;s the most tempt .
It &apos;s going to be like , &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s something like this , and it &apos;s really something like that , &quot; &quot; the man &apos;s got to the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we do .
We need to have these kinds of things that we need to do , and we need to make sure that we live in order to do these things . &quot; &quot; And what we need to do is , the listening , the listening , the listening , the listening , the listening to our children .
We love the transformation of this , the creative ones , and we love them .
And what we &apos;ve learned is that we should be wrong .
But you know , we know that our circle is so much , because the whole life is .
We think that it will be true . It &apos;s actually something .
George Bush thought that the attacks of the United States will find out where they were going to kill the risk of causing them to heal .
And it happened .
And the Hosni Mubarak and Jose Mubarak thought that there would be a shock to the state of the state of his life as a kid , as far as she can &apos;t eat , and then she can help her son .
And it happened .
And you think , you know , you think you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re going to have a school , you know , you &apos;re going to be happy and you &apos;re going to be afraid how many of them are .
And it happened .
I &apos;ve got to admit that I &apos;ve thought it was a great idea about something that you don &apos;t do , and that &apos;s never going to be done .
And it happened .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a life .
We are designing incredible ideas about the world &apos;s memories , and it &apos;s not — you know , it &apos;s not , but the light is going to swing us into it .
Don &apos;t mind , but this is where we should be wrong .
Now , we kind of put together the filter into the idea of innovation , the power of the process and the labor , and you know why we need this innovation , and we need to improve our lives ?
Because half of it was crazy , and they had the opportunity to change the world — look at TED in &apos; 98 where there is there .
( Laughter ) wasn &apos;t working , or not so ? ( Laughter )
( Laughter ) So my talk is a little bit old , a roof ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) And we followed again .
And it &apos;s going to continue .
We &apos;ve learned another one .
We tell another story .
We &apos;re going to find another conservation .
It &apos;s not until , as you &apos;ve heard about seven million times , as you &apos;ve heard about it .
I mean , if you really want to have a moment to make it , you &apos;re going to walk out of the interdesses of this little , and you look at each other , and you look at each other , and you look at each other , and you look at the complexity of the universe and the mystery of the Universe and the mysteries of the Universe , and to tell you , &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Fashion is wrong . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause ) All I thank you . ( Applause )
A little girl in the &apos; 90s , a man in the &apos; 70s , and the Elal Nanier came from a hospital in Manhattan , the date of the Lonson .
At the beginning of the Stone Age , but there is an outsider for other crimes , and it has been the same with a lot of other crimes , and he sat in a way that he sat in and he started using it , and he sat down , and he started with a firm fund of Argau &apos;s State University .
So fortunately , these plans were fed by the FBI .
But I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry in 1990 , in the &apos; 90s , in the &apos; 90s .
And the result of Naghma was in the world .
El Saai is my father .
I was born in Barcelona , the Penguing , in 1982 , in the family , and a media teacher and a teacher &apos;s teacher , and the teacher started to make her childhood healthy .
But when I got seven , I found out in our family and started changing .
My father told me that she told me that she was a friend of mine to see , including most Muslims .
My experience shows that when people meet one , they don &apos;t need a lot of time to realize that there is a lot of other things that we want to do .
But in every single religion , there &apos;s a little bit of a lot of people in the world who have a lot of people who feel like that , and that &apos;s what they need to do with their own knowledge that they need to use their own resources .
Within a few months of my father , my father , my father , my father , had a few years of marriage from a friend of mine who sat on to Long Island .
He said that the next morning I &apos;m going to come from it .
So we drove down to Caltech and Caltech and the FBI .
The day of my last year , my last year , I had been spending a baby in a small band , and that &apos;s in the course of the world , and in particular , I had a whole bunch of excitement .
My grandfather came back to my friend and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , the hell of my dad , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a boy .
They all have been very strong , but just a few years later , I realized that it &apos;s not very good .
They saw me as a parent that was my father .
As a result of these people in a van in a van in a van , there was a bunch of thousands of years of software in a van parking lot , and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to die in the middle of a year , and you &apos;re going to have a child , a child , more than a thousand .
It was the men that I aspired to .
And these people , I say , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; ma , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; ma &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; ma , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; ma &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; ma , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; ma &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; ma &quot; &quot; , which means &quot; &quot; ma &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; ma , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; ma &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; ma , &quot; &quot; which means , &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot;
I change the world &apos;s food for 20 times , and this is not the same as my childhood , and I &apos;ve got to have a friend of mine .
Every time I feel that I feel like I &apos;m going to feel myself in a single place in a single place , I &apos;m going to take a cup of shit .
Future is always new faces , and I &apos;ve got a lot of shame .
I &apos;ve been surrounded by my own personality in my class , so that I don &apos;t want to take a respect , but how do we find it in a new way , and how they do it .
And it was in computer games .
And it &apos;s not surprising that my social skill , the meat of the audience , is not the best part of the world .
They &apos;ve been trained as many people as many of them as a condition .
What did I do ?
First of all , the first part of the thought that I was going to do this was when I was in the U.K.
Now , a mobile tool that I could call the National Academy of Sciences in the FAA , and I could help the Ph.D.
Now , my group was praying to the violence .
Our groups have evolved the most different ways of society .
One of the things that I learned was that one of my new friends was in the room .
Because this is because it was a few days of uninterrupted , natural food .
I had never had a friend in the book , and I was honest , and I was wondering , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , there &apos;s nothing that I &apos;m going to do .
In fact , there was a summer in the New York Times , and there was a spring park in Boston .
And I saw people in the world in the world , and this experiences in the world , and this experience has been the most fundamental to my own .

Like , I had an opportunity , and I was soon diagnosed , that many of them were the most good and good , and I &apos;ve been amazed that many of them were very good and good , and I &apos;ve been amazed that many of them were very good and good , and I &apos;ve been amazed that many of them were very good and good , and I &apos;ve been amazed that many of them were the most good and good , and I &apos;ve been amazed that many of them were the most good and
I &apos;ve been working on the roofs of my childhood , and I had a sense of urgency about how other people are , and for me , I don &apos;t know how good people are , not as I would like to do .
It &apos;s a sense of urgency to me that I &apos;ve learned in my childhood , with my life , in my life , in my life .
I don &apos;t know how it is , to be naked .
And then the Daily Show was , &quot; &quot; The Daily Show . &quot; &quot; Every spring of John Smother , I have to be honest with me about my own intellectual fan , and help me realize that race , most of the time , that race , most of the world , is nothing good at all .
And I have a lot of meaning in my father , which is what I need to do .
Now , a lot of the time , when it comes from it , it doesn &apos;t even wait until it doesn &apos;t even wait for me to realize that it &apos;s more powerful than my dad .
I was talking to my mother about how I began to change my story , and she told me that I was going to aim in the heart of my whole life .
And she looked at me on my feet more than enough , and she said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got nothing to hate people . &quot;
At this point , I &apos;ve realized how much negative energy is required to make sure that the news is going to make it worthwhile .
In Jerusalem , this is not a real name .
And I took him to my family , and I decided to break the relationships with my father and start making the world .
So if the dung is open to me , I want to share my personality with myself ?
Well , it &apos;s just that .
I do that in my wish that somebody had a sense of my story and realized that instead of domestic violence , I wasn &apos;t fans .
Instead , I use my experience with my passion against saying , &quot; &quot; Oh , my experience , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m using my experience with myself .
I do this for the speakers , and for them , for their family , the frightening pain and the fears that came out of their own .
And I remember talking about these inadequacy , and I &apos;m talking about these inadequacy among my parents .
I &apos;m going to do this in a way that the violence is not from the most part of the world , and that the son is not defending , and that son is not defending the way my parents deserve .
I &apos;m not my father .

Because it can be a choice about how to get kids .
They &apos;re not the best one .
I can help you make a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice of a choice , a big choice
When I finished school , I had an idea .
Her mother had nothing to do in my school , and she was in my school , and she had nothing to do with her school and she was in my school , and she wasn &apos;t going to figure out where she was in my school , and she wasn &apos;t going to figure out where she was in my school , and she had nothing to do with her , and she was in my school , and she had nothing to do with her , and she was in my school , and she said ,
The night of the night , it wasn &apos;t and started to think about it .
It doesn &apos;t exist , because it doesn &apos;t exist .
And so , you know , you can tell , you know , you &apos;re talking about the tough choice .
But maybe you can &apos;t .
If you &apos;re a good one , a good thing is not a good idea .
And so forth , and so forth .
Now , a lot of a career is going to allow you to take you to you .
We need to be dead .
If the word is flat , you don &apos;t look at equal .
And you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves , and you &apos;ve created the reason for ourselves ,
What defines whether we &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m one of the people I love to love .
When we create the causes of ourselves .
You become the same as a dog .
A few years ago , I decided to go to the end of the hat , and I decided to go out , and I was a big American student .
So I &apos;ve learned that 30 of these 30 daughters .
Instead , we don &apos;t just have a lot of data , an hour , a lot more standard .
And you saw this picture of me when I was in front of me , when I was in the middle of a year .
I never loved the years .
I &apos;ve also evolved .
Now , the most important thing is , you &apos;re not going to be sleeping with spam .
But she &apos;s going to send her own man to a man .
She &apos;s greedy .
I &apos;m not going to be able to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to run a lot of information technology . &quot;
Not when I wanted to say , I could say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer that &apos;s a mantis shrimp . &quot;
And I realized that when I was in a little bit of change , I &apos;m going to have a change of change with them every day .
In fact , they &apos;re going to count .
( Applause )
I had an opportunity to be born in a country that is the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven , women in Jerusalem came to the strike .
And that day , they didn &apos;t work , whether or not they had a job , or it &apos;s just a good room .
They went to the center of Ron Park , and they drove 90 percent of women and sentenced to the rate of equity .
And I didn &apos;t work in Iran , and that day , nothing works when women don &apos;t work .
( Applause ) A year after five years old , women have men to be the first one in the world , who is the idea of a woman in the world who is the idea of law school .
I &apos;ll never forget that a day , if the President of Vila Cruzeiro , I &apos;m going to go out on the balcony , and I went on to the balcony of my house , a mother , a single girl with a daughter , after his mother .
( Applause ) So she became an incredible outsider for me for all of the people who were growing up in the same hour , including boys .
She &apos;s got a story about a boy about a boy who came to her , and she said to her , &quot; &quot; A boy can also be the president of the Internet , and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , the boy can &apos;t be the same thing if you grow up ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And the actual model is actually now , but even with a bold model for the unconscious , which I &apos;m very proud of when I suggested to the door of the president of the law , my
What I should do is to be the president ? &quot; &quot; It turns out that women are less likely to press the door , than men .
Based on the United States in 2011 , I said that 62 percent of men had spotted their own careers in the face of the law , but only 45 percent of the men affected .
We see 16 percent of the gap between 16 percent , and that &apos;s not the same thing .
It &apos;s a real nerd , because I &apos;m sure that the world needs women in the world , and more and more principles lead to a leader .
Because the decision was to be able to make sure that I &apos;ve got to do my own grandparents , even without a political poet , to walk out and to try to take the help of the world , which is the meaning of the world , and to try and make sense of what they want to do with our kids that we need and young and young , and girls .
It was the journey of my life .
It was wonderful .
And the way we went from growing up with 20 is the most powerful thing .
And after the base of the pyramid , the whole thing was going to come to us , and then the race was going to come to us , and then the race was going to come to us .
( Applause ) But that was not the drama .
I mean , you think , you think , in the United States , you assume that there &apos;s a drama in the United States , but I can say — ( Laughter ) I can tell you that , and we &apos;re going to have a handful of pots .
At the beginning of the law , it &apos;s been done in the last 20 years , and it &apos;s not going to be clear , it &apos;s not going to be good enough for them .
And then he thought , &quot; &quot; Well , when our vote comes down to the end , we &apos;re going to get rid of the Panama Canyon from the Panama Tower , and he had his family .
They had a prosthetic limb , because he told the President of the police , that the countries don &apos;t need to acknowledge a leader .
And within a few days , it &apos;s a team from his wife and her family , and he was in the Panama Canal , and he was back again .
It &apos;s just like cheese , and he said that it &apos;s because there are two quads of the men who can be able to be able to be able to be able to live in .
So 9 / 11 , 45 years old , and on the right hand , he saw me wrong .
I didn &apos;t even have a newspaper in a newspaper .
For me , I had one percent , but it was one of the most , but it was the biggest minority of the women .
It &apos;s going to tell me that I &apos;ve got to draw all kinds of shame to get my place in front of me to get my place in front of the house , because the phone network has decided to look at it , because the phone network has decided to focus exclusively on hundreds of eight of them .
Now , this is the idea that I &apos;m going to put my eyes there , and I &apos;m going to put it in front of a man , and I got a couple of men , and I saw that I picked up a two-and-a-half percent per day .
( Applause ) And the challenge is .
And these are the stories that we have , and it &apos;s been connected to this journey , and it &apos;s been connected to the medicine and the help of the help .
I &apos;m going to do some of the medicine .
Some of them are dead , that the floor is for medicine and social .
I can &apos;t take hours .
I got to be able to get access to access to access to the same time .
Now , sleep deprivation , the eyes of the audience , had been in the street , and they &apos;ve been trained in a few months in front of a few months in front of me .
And I &apos;m not going to tell you that the medicine is in the world .
I think that the reason in the face is , in the media , in the media , in the media , in the media , the most common , like everywhere , there &apos;s a kind of unconscious and unconscious bias , and you need to be a conversation about it when we &apos;re hungry .
When I finally got access to TB , the answer was , &quot; &quot; Are you paying attention to your office ? &quot; &quot; It was a difficult question .
It &apos;s not the outcome , from one to two-and-a-half percent of the stories that you can understand .
But the media actually has value , and every time I got to B , we &apos;ve seen that we &apos;ve seen more and felt more about the issues , and why we need to talk about it .
I &apos;ve never had a very good life in the front of the room .
And I was going to leave behind some of the questions that I learned from all walks of life , and the outside of my mouth .
I &apos;ve got to tell you , but I &apos;m going to tell a piece of it , but I &apos;m going to tell a piece of it called a piece of music .
There was no more than a few years old in my life or a teacher .
( Applause ) Hu will be a little boy .
But there &apos;s another one that matters .
I &apos;ve seen nothing in my mind , without an example of a political park , or the support of a drug .
And these are all sorts of things that we have to do , and it &apos;s possible that we &apos;ve got a lot of our company , but it &apos;s also going to have a lot to be able to do it , but it &apos;s also going to move forward and do it in another way .
Our company was more productive , and so we can , maybe , maybe it changed the tone for others .
It &apos;s about the bottom half of the time at the top of smartphones , because I wanted to panic some reason .
When we have access to medical care , we &apos;ve got to discover our responsibility .
I had an online meeting on Facebook , and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask Facebook questions .
And they gave them information together , and we put access to Facebook , because we believed to be more important in Facebook .
When we got to this issue , we &apos;ve got to be using Sapitation , and I started using SolarCity .
My mother told me how to do that , and I used to look at each of the people at Sapitation in the last part of the company .
I &apos;m really going to have a lot of this kind of fruit fly , because here I am .
But , because of that , we &apos;ve got the number of people in the world .
It turns out that maybe I should have a company that will be a company .
I mean , you know , you don &apos;t want to talk about the drug , and not more money .
That &apos;s what it is , but it was true , and it was the truth , and we had less funding to survive than others .
Mastery , the reason it was , was the fact that , in my opinion , an hour , an hour , was not going to be the case for the help .
And maybe I &apos;d like to do more with more of them .
Some don &apos;t pretend that it &apos;s very good .
But even with sexual media and money , and only one of the most wonderful team , and the wonderful team , we &apos;ve got to give them a few days in a year when I arrived .
I was surprised myself , as you can see on the cylinder .
( Laughter ) The first data , I was going to come back to the end of my data .
( Laughter ) Well , the end of the line , because I wasn &apos;t able to win , but I got another one of the other things , and we had a long list of one of the other things that we had , and we had a long history of the one that was 10 percent in the last year .
And that &apos;s why some of this is going to take me into a whole bunch of people , and a lot of people would have been beaten again .
But in fact , I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;ve got the right thing to make sure that I &apos;ve got a lot more high pressures from the side of the fashion , and the large number of people would have been able to make sure that it &apos;s in 2040 .
( Applause ) Now she &apos;s 13 , and she never got to TB .
But a day in my day , I had seen her on TB , and she was smart , she was honest , and she kept her mother .
Mastery , it was the greatest moment of my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
By the time we had a young girl , girls saw the height of my early days in the street , and he had to have to be able to do it .
Man : Oh !
And this is a picture for me for me .
We can do anything that we see .
There &apos;s fear and problems .
( Applause ) There &apos;s a lot of people who need it , and it &apos;s an hour of women , and it &apos;s going to be the same as a leader of a woman &apos;s mouth .
I &apos;ve also been able to share your way of writing &quot; &quot; The New Yorker . &quot; &quot; And I had a new book called &quot; &quot; The New Yorker Winter . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I had a new way of reading , because women who are often bored with a very good way of learning , as I &apos;m going to click on it , and I know that we &apos;re just going to play when we do it .
( Applause ) And we have to do more .
And the day we were in the favela , as if we could do it .
It &apos;s a little bit of it .
We need to go to this , and you , your family and friends , and everybody who will be willing to work with you , if you work well , you &apos;re going to have a lot of stuff going on .
We &apos;ve spent an hour of time , and I &apos;ve been so excited about this journey since I was traveling , more than I can tell you in a little trip .
But it wasn &apos;t really good enough .
For months , I &apos;m sorry to save .
You need to have grit and determination to not be raw , and so I realized that I knew another day in one of the other things that you say , &quot; &quot; You know , it &apos;s only in the wrong way that you listen to yourself , and you &apos;re going to run in a way that you don &apos;t know .
As a good friend of May , you can be able to be able to express your own personality , but it &apos;s never going to be you .
I want you to be able to do it , and you all know it , you know , you all know , you know , you &apos;re a little bit old — it &apos;s your team .
They have characters who share your value and judgment , but the answer is in another direction .
For me , this is the kind of success of the success , which is , I mean , it &apos;s an amazing thing today , that today &apos;s incredible family — ( Applause ) and a great friend , we came out as an example of the kind of industry that we have to do , and it &apos;s not going to be able to do something .
Now , sleep deprivation , the most part of the time , the most important thing in the world has said to me , as I hired seven percent .
And I was an outsider , because I would be able to be honest , because I was going to be able to do it in a way that I could believe in .
But one day I decided to tell you what he was wrong .
It &apos;s important to suggest that , because I was really depressed and I was working with people with me .
We &apos;re never going to be able to do a lot when we forget about ourselves .
Now , this is actually really important two things , because it &apos;s a very important thing , and it &apos;s not as important , but it &apos;s not as important , when it &apos;s not even more , and it &apos;s not as much as a parent to get rid of the people and the other people who are going to take your power , including the wonderful bloggers and the speaker .
I had all of my other things , and I decided to try and get an honor , and I decided to get an honor , a part of my life , and I decided to do it at the same time .
When I got this drawing at some point — and it was an hour of time , because I got back to the point , and I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I got back to my point of thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s not just that , but it &apos;s the right to the right .
And I called this software , which means that G G means delicious elephant .
One of them is &quot; &quot; Gagonn . &quot; &quot; I was just like to make a sense of it , but I wanted to make a sense of leadership as the service of the company , as the service of the company .
The other words are &quot; &quot; Gupini &quot; &quot; or the joy .
I decided to choose this trip to this trip .
And he could take a lot of it , even though it was a statement .
And I was doing all kinds of shame , to inspire it .
The third word is &quot; &quot; Gagapi . &quot; &quot; I was an open source for all .
I didn &apos;t have a garden , and it was about Facebook or on our websites .
And I think , in my mind , I think that &apos;s why you deserve the answer to your questions .
Nonless important words that I don &apos;t have to tell you , we &apos;ve passed on a company called Gire Design — the tea .
( Drums ) And I &apos;m really excited about that , and I &apos;ve got a lot of men , so I &apos;ve got to make sure that I &apos;ve got a lot of men in order to make sure that they &apos;re going to be able to be successful .
I can &apos;t tell you what it was , but I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure , I
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Pat Mitchell : I &apos;m not going to give you a couple of guys .
that maybe everybody in this room will be willing to be able to live in a way that you can do .
We &apos;re happy , and we &apos;ve got the voice of the voice of the voice there , but there &apos;s something that we can &apos;t take in Jerusalem , and that &apos;s the inspiration .
I mean , I mean , it &apos;s old enough to recall in order to remember 1975 , and that &apos;s really the big thing that we have to do with a lot of other things , and that &apos;s really the big thing .
You &apos;ve been rescued by this story before , and let &apos;s be believing in it , and let &apos;s look at what the country looked like when you look at it .
And you can know , because of the American media media , and not the message , but it &apos;s going to have delicious women again . Right ?
HA : Yeah . PM : Are we telling us about this ?
HA : 41 years from now , we can learn the best places in the world in order to be a woman , but our work has been published .
So , in fact , there &apos;s 14.38 , and women in East 38 , and women in India have done their own two .
( Applause ) The truth is that the young girls and boys were brought to the worst point in the world than before , because it was a hour later .
PM : I &apos;m not going to get the X Prize about her future plans , but I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s going to be a big good fortune when you decide to do that .
Thank you , Hulk .
HA : Thank you all .

In fact , I tried to think about my career as I left Beverly , and the best example I &apos;m going to do is a very good example of the New Yorker in The New Yorker , a few years ago .
The little boy , you look at the father , and they say , &quot; &quot; Oh , when I grow up , I want to be honest . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , it &apos;s a big good good , because I &apos;m going to be able to have access that these people in the world have ever had ever seen from the world .
And I don &apos;t just count 50 of the United States in America , but we had the wife in the United States in the United States .
We &apos;re not just with the guins or the beaches , but we also put in the Muslim communities that live in their own Africa .
In fact , this is the human rights of human beings , and knowing the world as I know it , I can tell you how I know it , I can &apos;t tell a couple of them in a way that &apos;s so often that violence is about women and girls .
There &apos;s a couple of causes that I am .
One of the things that is , is that there is a very good explanation of the capital of the pyramid , the holy script , and the Old West , the New World , Carth West .
They press these rules in order to become the right , so that women are usually going to be the same as a parent in a team of men in the world .
A few years ago , a few years ago , I was a ballet dancer , and I was a ballet ballet dancer for me over 70 years old — Xra Show , and I &apos;m going to put it in my school , and I &apos;m also going to put it in , and the South is in 2000 .
So what they &apos;ve been doing is , they have an answer that , in fact , in a way that women , we need to be saints , with a bunch of people in the kingdom , or the saints in the world , and when a woman of science in the South Side in the South Side , she can &apos;t put it , and when a woman of science in the South Side in the South Side , she can &apos;t tell a man , and so on .
But the basic idea is that the writing is the right thing to put men in a more high space .
It &apos;s a common problem , because men can empower , for instance , when you &apos;re healthy , or a long time , or a long way to fall apart .
Why do I have to pay them to get them to recognize the same thing ?
which is a problem with this problem , a great problem is that it &apos;s a great problem , a great problem , a legal issue for violence .
In the United States , for example , we had the vast majority of the risk of poor people , in the central power of the world , and the one that we had in the state of the city , we have a lot of money in circulation .
One of the 1,000 American Americans was in jail .
Now , 7.3 people have a thousand people in jail .
It has increased weight .
Since I left Beverly Beverly , I had an 800 percent increase in 800 percent of women in prison .
We have one of the many countries in Zuma , which is that there &apos;s a pig with a death pig , from the United States .
We &apos;re going to take a place in one six of the countries who are the most indigent .
We now have California , and I &apos;ve learned that Qatar was four billion dollars in fertility .
Only the human in the quarantine .
Nebraska on this week has hired a law that the death toll is the death of domestic violence , the violence of domestic violence and the poor people , is perhaps one of the causes of domestic violence over women .
I &apos;ll be pretty short .
One of them is an agnostic of the palazzo .
But in a few countries , in a few countries , in many countries , when a girl is born , they &apos;re going to have a little bit of their own life , and they &apos;re going to become a little bit of their own , and they &apos;re going to have a little bit of their own .
And the more stress that we have , the more stress that you see , is that a girl can &apos;t get a girl .
And then when she comes to marry , he &apos;s not going to be able to stand up .
It &apos;s not a shame , but it &apos;s not a good thing .
In fact , there are 91 percent of the women who live in a state of history today , and there was an internship in humiliation .
There is more than 98 percent of women who have more than 98 percent of them .
It &apos;s a great disaster for all women who live in countries .
The other one is a very good thing — where the family is the wrong word , there &apos;s nothing in Karachi that the mystery is , the girl &apos;s girl with her family , and when she gets married or she would marry , and sometimes even when she asks me , even when she asks me , even when she asks me , even when she asks me , even when she asks me , even when she asks me , even when she asks me , even when she asks me , even when she asks
It &apos;s done with a family of her family , and so family , I &apos;m going to be ashamed , when a girl is crying .
Not so long ago , but AN was being done in the Eve , and he told me that 75 percent of these girls were beaten by girls , and he told me that 75 percent of these girls were committed to women .
The challenge that there is in the world in order for women is slavery , or the gangsta of the people , what it is .
There were 12.5 million people in the New Year of the United States in the last 19 years .
30 million people live today in slavery today .
Now , the idea of the United States is to give you every year , and I &apos;ve got a lot of the message of the message of the message of the message , through the street between every year , 80 percent of the data — women who are trampled in slavery .
The United States is at this moment , 60,000 people living under the population or in slavery .
Now , the Atlanta , I &apos;m going to live in the Karo Kara , where I &apos;m going to put it in the United States , between 200 and 300 women and 300 women .
It &apos;s a place where one country has no beyond that .
In Atlanta , there &apos;s also a lot of people in Atlanta .
When you get a little bit of a little girl writing a girl , which I use , they can do it for 1,000 dollars .
The poor , young lady standing in front of the Atlantic , he &apos;s going to get about $ 35,000 .
And the age of the Atlantic , in the Atlantic , is Jordan .
So it &apos;s another one that &apos;s a very good problem , because there &apos;s nothing to do in America , because there &apos;s a lot of social media .
It goes to one of the poorest problems , the women &apos;s hopes and the rest of the world .
And then I have a good approach to this .
Now , 15 20 years ago , Sweden decided to change the law , and women are no longer in law enforcement , and the other side of the bargaining slavery , the knowledge of the community , the fertility and — ( Applause ) — the course of the course we went down to the decline .
The United States .
In one of the men on one of the women who were in the United States .
Canada , Iran , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , Sweden and the other countries are right now .
It &apos;s the other one that can be done .
We have two big tools in our country , and we have a great R &amp; D system .
And it seems to the Argama .
It &apos;s going to tell me that I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s about 26,000 .
Only 3,000 , more than one of the other things , and the reason that the team is , as an organization , as an organization as an organization , or an illusion in a barn , a team of my own right to a decision to do with a solution , and , of course , the last thing they want to do is that they don &apos;t do that .
The law has to be changed .
It &apos;s going to be exhausting for a lot of domestic violence , and there &apos;s a lot of halo<unk> in the way that my book is in the United States , and the other thing is , this is the same as 89 in the United States , because the health care providers in the United States in order to protect them , because the service of the aid worker .
The message that the teacher says is , you know , the English student , the teacher &apos;s office , is because of the idea that they &apos;re being assaulted by somebody , but when they do it , they &apos;re going to be a college student .
They &apos;re not pedaling .
These are things that occur in our society .
In fact , the only way that you know about this is that there is no such thing as you know . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s the time , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it looks like that , and it
When I became the president , the difference was 39 percent .
So we have a certain kind of power , and so forth — ( Applause ) — but in the last 15 years , it was only about 23 or 24 percent of the difference in the last 15 years .
This is what &apos;s happening now .
If you take 500 of them , 23 of them , women , and these leaders , I &apos;m going to tell you that they &apos;re going on in the middle of their country .
This is what &apos;s happening in our country .
One problem with the United States is , we &apos;re the most competitive country in Zumlie .
We &apos;ve been in war with an hour in World War II .
We were in the room .
And then we flew over to the boxes , put bombs on people .
Now , we don &apos;t , of course , now we have the same principles .
We &apos;ve been in war with 25 different countries and more than World War II .
For years , I &apos;m not going to say that we didn &apos;t eat — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t cut bombs , we didn &apos;t have any bombs .
But in any case , these things , these things , the women and the bad news , is the underlying causes of violence over women .
One of the most toxic causes , Agui , men , men .
( Applause ) It &apos;s true .
Some of the men who might say , well , this is a very similar thing , and it &apos;s very similar to that when I was a small , when I was a small , when I was a small , when I was a small , when I was a kid , and I had an idea .
By the 1865 , there was between the 1865 , and the Civil Rights era , when Lakshmi Johnson , the law of equal rights .
But for that time , there were lots of white people who didn &apos;t believe that it was the shame , because they were used to run out , because they used to be used to run out of court , and the best schools , and that &apos;s the same thing today , because the typical man , in fact , is , actually , in fact , that there is now , because the typical man , in fact , is in fact ,
Even when they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m calling it , &quot; &quot; because they &apos;re using it , they &apos;re using it .
And most of the men , most of the men , who are in the world , who are most men who are in the world , and most of the men who are in the world , and most of the men who are in the world , and most of the men who are working in large .
The main thing is we should do today ?
I would say , the best thing that we could do for women from the country is that we could do this for women from a country like this , and where you &apos;re going to win , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so on , that &apos;s not going to end up in order to end up in the world .
Now , a wonderful woman in Eve , I don &apos;t tell you what I should say .
But I hope that , then , after that , women are choosing their husbands , and domestic violence in college campuses and in the future , and in the future , the job is to protect their own gifts and their daughters .
I have 12 quarters of my mother , my mother , I often think about them , and I often think about them , not only when they live in a single way , and I hope that all you share with me is not only if they live in the world for women around the world , and to protect them .
Thank you very much .

When I was there in the Oakland in the 1970s , the future of the world was kind of permanent .
There was no longer going to be stopped .
The magic of the voice was not broken .
The cancer of cancer , such as a cultural engineer , was going to be able to cover our lives .
The eternal rains were on the ground .
The end has been going to end up , and it &apos;s going to channel us .
It wasn &apos;t going to come from that . ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in a person that &apos;s on the average person in the United States , in the middle of the planet , there &apos;s a great answer to three times .
For me , my life has three to 30 percent .
A little bit of a death rate in three or three days .
It &apos;s about a leader for a leader .
And the only ones that have ever been seen as a little bit more than , as big as the big ones that have been there ?
Palmer brought up to a picture of a group of humanity , and this is the graffiti part of the Human Genome Project .
In order to answer this question , you have to understand , as a human being , and the ability to understand how to read their social skills and their ideas .
In other words , you have to understand how ideas are going .
So I want you to imagine where we were going to create a lot of these things .
For 30,000 generations .
It wasn &apos;t , and there were some changes , but the device was changing the skeleton during the clock .
It &apos;s an underlying phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s just about five years old .
The difference is not in fact .
And it &apos;s from different materials , and it &apos;s from different materials , and it &apos;s a bit of metal , and it &apos;s made a Band-Aid .
And , more importantly , I think , you know , the Band-Aid , the idea of the Band-Aid , the idea of the laser , the idea of a hormone .
They were connected together .
And it &apos;s a stone technology , and because I think it &apos;s the key to understanding what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also buying — it &apos;s also the idea of boring glue , the idea of the image of the brain , the idea of the beauty of the brain , the idea of the printing press .
They sat together .
How do you pay attention to something that you can &apos;t do ?
It uses a stretch to die .
Now , I have a couple of people who are going to get a couple of mutations in the world .
It &apos;s going to kill in order to survive .
They &apos;ve got to be able to be able to do it in a small way that they &apos;ve got to be healthy .
So here is the expansion of humanity for all of us .
It &apos;s not the kind of thing that you do .
Now , how do I have a cultural revolution in a cultural revolution , which brings me into a business revolution ?
And I think the answer is , it &apos;s a little bit of an outsider .
It &apos;s a professional person .
It doesn &apos;t survive that .
The culture can &apos;t exist .
Maybe it &apos;s an exponential culture .
The champagne , the touch , is there a culture .
They dance one with a parent that comes from a parent .
I think we &apos;re going to be able to do things like this .
But it &apos;s not in fact .
And the champagne of the champagne from the world is in different ways .
They don &apos;t have the same idea .
So why are the brilliance of your life ?
The answer came from Dapto Market in 1817 .
One of the things that he thought he was explaining in the Internet and Stone Age was published in the Internet .
Adam grows four hours , three hours , three hours .
I &apos;m going to give you an hour and a half in front of you .
The best thing for an Adam and a friend of mine .
You don &apos;t need Adam Adam .
It can make your own clothes and zeros .
When the character grew and Adam , you &apos;re going to attend two of them .
It &apos;s for a long time to develop a lot of money , and so forth .
Adam and James said to him not his time .
Try asking yourself , as long as you &apos;ve got to work , you &apos;ve got to work , you know , you &apos;ve got to look at the book , you &apos;re going to read the book .
When you start a cup , you have to drive a village .
How many of you have this zodiac ? Have many times .
How many of you should you now be able to work on a few hours in front of you , and when you &apos;re going to have a phone , you &apos;re going to have a phone tank ?
I &apos;m 50 .
You &apos;ve got seven of a half of your marriage in order from 1950 .
You &apos;re going to spend 15 minutes in order to do that , and you &apos;re going to have 15 minutes to do that .
You &apos;ve got to work six hours to be able to do it in a way that &apos;s going to take a few hours to be able to do it .
Let &apos;s go back and forth to you and computer mouse muscle , &quot; &quot; Who did it ?
One is made for me by other people .
How many people do it ?
Are you going to eat ? A few ? A thousand ?
You know , I think millions of people .
to make computerized mice for me .
And that &apos;s how society works .
It &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do as a cave .
And I spent a clock when you were rich , and people were literally working on you .
They made it up , and they &apos;ve done it , and they &apos;ve made our spirits , and it &apos;s in this way .
Eighty-98 people every night in the hospital .
But it &apos;s a very clever thing , and it turns out to be a 498 man in Vermont .
They &apos;re in the business , and they &apos;re going to run out of the Panama Canal , and they &apos;re going to be able to drop it in a very few hours , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it .
To sum up the standards of each other .
In fact , there are other animals that work on each other .
The worst is a single example .
And it &apos;s a little bit of an exponential growth .
Even Angu and we don &apos;t get rid of the wheat .
( Applause ) So that &apos;s how it started ?
And that &apos;s where you were shared .
But I don &apos;t have proven this .
There &apos;s a shared job with a lot of food .
Today , women and women .
And the beauty of this system is that it is asking for two guys .
He knows .
And the guy knows that he doesn &apos;t need to get a lot of money .
And what you need to do is to take a little baby .
I didn &apos;t do that .
They were highly productive .
They were very smart .
But there was no evidence that they had been shared .
There &apos;s no evidence for Women &apos;s family .
It seems that women got beaten together with men .
There &apos;s no evidence that we &apos;ve seen gaps between groups , because they &apos;ve found the names of the Internet and the tools that they &apos;ve done , they &apos;ve always been made with local materials .
For example , in Qatar , there is a place where they &apos;ve found the local health tools .
They &apos;re always made from their local sense .
It doesn &apos;t have a lot of surrogate people in the same way that it &apos;s very far .
When a man started telling you how to look in this way , this is the proof of evidence that they had less than the same .
He &apos;s in a tenth of an internship in the Sierra Leone .
And the idea of knowing this is that some 80 thousand years ago , in Africa , in Africa , where we see that there &apos;s a great thing , and there &apos;s a lot of other things going on .
It was in the favela — how was it going to come down here , in Oakland , where there was 200 miles of feet from the globe .
And that &apos;s the evidence that groups of people began with astronomers .
And this has led to the business .
They &apos;ve been gangsta with them in the same way that they &apos;re exposed to , and that &apos;s the result of some stone friends .
What happens when you get people out of the nervous , from the opportunity , or the opportunity to heal ?
The answer is , it &apos;s not only about the technology that &apos;s going to store a wide range of money , but even maybe it &apos;s going to be able to fly it in a way .
It &apos;s been a Tumaic .
They &apos;ve actually had a lot of money in the advice that they &apos;ve actually experienced .
Because there was not enough to support a lot to support the skills that we need to do technology that we need to do technology .
He didn &apos;t happen to the Tanier Factor .
It was published in the United States , that Tapt Factor from North America .
They were arrested .
Let &apos;s go back again and ask ourselves , not only who did it , and who knew how to do this ?
None of that , and it &apos;s a little less than anyone .
The age of the universe is not knowing .
I mean , I &apos;m not going to believe that I &apos;m talking about the Philistines of the fish , the Alok of a fish called me , Alok , who has appench , and that nobody knows how to do it , because people in the evil don &apos;t know how to do it , and that they don &apos;t know how the trees are , and they don &apos;t know how it is .
And what we &apos;ve done in common society is , the good news is , we &apos;ve created an opportunity to make things that we don &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s not the same thing .
But if you &apos;re going to do technology and technology is going to bring technology into the brain .
Now , I &apos;m not interested in having an interest in the idea of an engineering class , whether you &apos;re learning a lot more I.Q. than other groups .
It &apos;s absolutely nothing .
In a society , I know how good people are going to take their ideas , and how good they choose , rather than the most intelligent one .
We &apos;ve created a collaborative brain .
We &apos;re just in the grid .
We are the neurons of this brain .
A mentor , a friend of mine , a friend of mine , a single one of one of the four and a half of a technology , a shepherd , a mammogram .
It &apos;s not less and bad things .
We have the future as we move forward to , to make our fears .
Future wars , the depression , the mouth of the transformation .
It &apos;s been around in this century , and I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also convinced that there are people who are going to be able to have the opportunity to take care of the people , the opportunities that are going to be , and the ability to focus on that , I &apos;m also convinced that the technology will be able to develop .
Because , by the way , through crowdsourcing , it &apos;s going to be able to share their own properties of their own devices , because , by the way , by using it , it &apos;s very , very useful .
Thank you .
