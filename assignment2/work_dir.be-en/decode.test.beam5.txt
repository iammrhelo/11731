A lot of that year will be able to be able to be able to do that <unk> .
<unk> them about them about what they &apos;re <unk> .
And it &apos;s like , but I think , I think , it &apos;s a kind of <unk> , and I think , it &apos;s like , and I think it .
And I thought I thought about it , and I thought in a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is the <unk> of learning .
<unk> of my family family family , a <unk> of his family <unk> <unk> , which was a little bit of it .
That &apos;s what he did .
He said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s . &quot; &quot; And this .
And I started to write , as a <unk> of my family &apos;s able to work and my family <unk> , my family would be able to print a couple of <unk> in my <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
It &apos;s a result of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 12 million .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
If you &apos;re going to be able to be able to <unk> and <unk> , and in <unk> , and they &apos;re a few hours of <unk> .
But what we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> <unk> , which will be able to live in a <unk> of time , and then we live in a way .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , I &apos;m not <unk> , because I would be <unk> , because I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> of what we &apos;re going to be .
We &apos;ve learned some of what we &apos;ve learned is that we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> and <unk> in our life .
And one of them , I &apos;ve been able to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
( Video ) <unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ?
EM : Yeah .
<unk> : <unk> can &apos;t you in <unk> .
PM : So what &apos;s happening ?
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; when I was <unk> .
( Laughter ) And : I &apos;m not going to be ?
This is a lot of physics , we need to be able to get a lot of stress , that can be a lot of stress .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> in the world .
It turns out of online University and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that they can <unk> their lives .
But it &apos;s not just <unk> .
Many of you , I think about the <unk> <unk> that in <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , like <unk> than a giant <unk> .
I think it &apos;s a few hours of space and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> that we &apos;ve created in the <unk> .
And I think I think it &apos;s true , for example , and I think it &apos;s a sense of <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve created .
Now we &apos;re going to be a giant <unk> .
There &apos;s a little bit of a story , and he &apos;s going to say , and I &apos;m going to be able to be <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be .
So how you can see you can be <unk> .
Imagine like , how do you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to <unk> 20 or 20 years ago .
A few years later , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that people .
And if you want to be able to <unk> on the <unk> of someone in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> that .
In a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the United States in the United States , when the days in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , when in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And what if we were able to develop a lot of technology in our <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> .
I think it &apos;s a good , <unk> , which is the <unk> of us , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
Now , I think , I think we want to be , if you want to be a lot of what we &apos;re going to do it ?
Thank you .
( Applause )
You &apos;re going to be a <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
We have a lot more about <unk> in the United States , and we &apos;re really much more likely to be able to get more <unk> .
In fact , the answer is the questions .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what you want to do you .
And then we can do it to be <unk> and <unk> them .
And at us in the <unk> , we have to be <unk> <unk> .
These are called the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And it &apos;s the <unk> that those <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
What we do about about forests ?
So what &apos;s <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
( Applause ) So that &apos;s going to be able to get to school , and to say , &quot; &quot; Well , that .
The <unk> is that .
<unk> , they &apos;re not going to be able to get to the way .
And in the United States , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s why not in <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> ?
We &apos;re in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t think you can &apos;t be able to get out .
What do they do do ?
<unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of people in the world , and there &apos;s a little bit more <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of three percent .
<unk> .
What they &apos;re called <unk> percent of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What is the answer about about what we &apos;re going ?
We have to do how to do that .
<unk> .
And it &apos;s <unk> and the <unk> that he had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like this .
It &apos;s all of these brain <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It turns out .
<unk> , I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I want to talk about what I want to talk about what we do .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , when we think about it .
I don &apos;t know you , but if I &apos;m going to tell you , you can see a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s true , because it &apos;s not <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> and <unk> .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve learned is that we &apos;re going .
And I went back and I would be able to be able to <unk> in my life .
And you know , and I want to be a <unk> <unk> that we can be able to be a lot of them .
So , in fact , we <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> .
We see in <unk> .
We &apos;re <unk> from <unk> .
It &apos;s not a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s kind of us .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
So , our <unk> <unk> <unk> in a few weeks , and we &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> for 80 minutes .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s what happens .
And they &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I think of them , it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , &quot; &quot; and you can be <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the word &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; in the word &quot; &quot; in the <unk> .
( Laughter ) We said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> about about <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> ?
So how how do this is it ?
How do we <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> ?
And what we &apos;ve learned about this way that we &apos;re going ?
This is the key thing about , but I have a few hours .
And to be <unk> , I want to be able to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
When I came back back to the first time I was <unk> , I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> <unk> .
In the United States in the United States , which is the <unk> for the <unk> .
That &apos;s a few weeks .
A friend said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a great <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s just a boy .
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> on me , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
So I went back to the past few years , and it &apos;s a lot of people in the United States .
It &apos;s a lot of people in a few years ago , for me , because I was an <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And then I remember one of a moment .
And I went back in the past <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> as my grandfather as I was born .
It was a <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> for the <unk> , and when we look at the next day , and when we look at the next time , it &apos;s <unk> for the <unk> .
Now , I don &apos;t even know that <unk> , I was <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> , I was <unk> .
I was going to tell you , it was my first time in <unk> <unk> , and I was one .
For example of my seventeenth birthday to my home , I was able to print my home , and I was able to <unk> my home to my home , and I didn &apos;t have to <unk> , but I &apos;m not <unk> how to <unk> .
And I didn &apos;t have been <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and I had no idea .
And the more thing about me to me , and I was <unk> .
I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m not going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and I &apos;m going to know , and
<unk> .
But there &apos;s a small <unk> , a little bit in my head and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> . It was a <unk> .
And I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because I &apos;m going to be a lot of <unk> in <unk> .
Now , it &apos;s true for me to work , but in <unk> , I was <unk> , and I was <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
I think I think a <unk> <unk> , because I &apos;m going to be a model , because I think it &apos;s so hard .
It &apos;s not just to be able to be able to be <unk> .
We <unk> .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
But it &apos;s like this way that I &apos;ve been <unk> for the world is not for me .
But I think this is a very important <unk> .
Most of us , we &apos;ve done a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of people who have been <unk> , because it &apos;s <unk> , because the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s a lot .
It &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , and we &apos;re also <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So there &apos;s a few weeks , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in our <unk> and <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of people who have been <unk> in this way .
<unk> <unk> , what &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> about the <unk> of the <unk> about the <unk> of the <unk> about the <unk> of the <unk> .
And one of us are what we started to <unk> .
A few years later , for a few years .
When I came back to my house in a <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve been able to print my home in my <unk> , and I &apos;ve been able to print my home in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;ve been able to print my home .
And I decided that if I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to be <unk> from a lot of them .
And it was a lot of <unk> years in my life .
But I think I think , I &apos;m going to be able to be <unk> , and I want to be a <unk> , and I want to be a <unk> , and I would be <unk> .
And if I want to be a lot of that , then we have a little bit of the <unk> .
It &apos;s not a lot of <unk> , because it wasn &apos;t a lot of <unk> , because we &apos;ve learned about it .
Most of our hearts and <unk> , and <unk> .
The name says , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s great , <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and she said that I was able to <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
The fact is , you think about it — about it , and you &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) So we have been <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> about it .
In this , we &apos;ve learned about <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
It &apos;s a kind of <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of what it &apos;s happening in the United States .
It &apos;s a lot of what we &apos;re going to be , and we want to be <unk> and we want to be <unk> .
That &apos;s <unk> .
( Laughter ) To do that , we need to be able to change the way , we need to change the way .
Imagine that we all were <unk> in <unk> .
If we want to be more <unk> , more more likely to be able to <unk> , and to create a <unk> .
I know that it &apos;s a lot of many things , but I &apos;m not the first that .
In the book , we said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , we live in <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> , and they can take their sense of our <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> and gentlemen , <unk> <unk> <unk> for a few hours : <unk> <unk> .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s like that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is , <unk> , and there are the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s the <unk> of all of those who <unk> in <unk> .
And <unk> , they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of people in the United States , but they were also much more likely to be able to work , but they also have much more likely in their <unk> .
So if it &apos;s a small <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , all of us , the <unk> thing .
If I was <unk> , you don &apos;t be <unk> , because it was not <unk> .
If the first time the first time for the first time , if you don &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
<unk> it ?
It turns out .
Yeah ?
And as as a <unk> , we have a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but when I was in my book , and when I was in my <unk> , and when I was in a few years ago , and when I was in <unk> years , and I live in a <unk> years for me .
And I think it &apos;s true that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> , and I don &apos;t know what it was like to my <unk> or <unk> .
But it &apos;s true .
<unk> <unk> , and when I want to do you , I have to tell you , I want to do that .
It &apos;s also <unk> .
But it &apos;s a lot of what we &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , in which is an <unk> .
It &apos;s no idea of <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
Instead , it turns out , and she would be able to <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s hard hard to be , but in , <unk> <unk> .
Because you need to talk to think about ourselves , and you can say , and I think you can do it .
<unk> , we can &apos;t have to be able to <unk> , like , &quot; &quot; Well , we are not <unk> .
Or , &quot; &quot; And these people were going to be <unk> , but all of it .
There &apos;s a lot of humiliation , we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to get out .
Thank you .
( Applause )
A few months in <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> on the time at a time at a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that in the <unk> <unk> .
You know , you know , it &apos;s <unk> , if you &apos;re not <unk> and <unk> , and we &apos;re not <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So in the United States ( Applause )
So what &apos;s a lot of what happens to be ?
In her feet on the <unk> .
<unk> , that &apos;s a legacy that &apos;s very important <unk> .
( Laughter ) So I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and she &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s me .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
In the past few years , I was a lot of what we &apos;ve learned , and how we &apos;ve learned is , and how we &apos;ve learned about it .
<unk> , I &apos;ve been able to write a few years in New York .
It &apos;s a lot of a lot of you can see someone but in a <unk> , and in a <unk> , a <unk> : <unk> .
( Laughter ) In one of us , <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> from the <unk> , and you can &apos;t think about it .
So we &apos;re going .
We know that , in a moment .
We are people , we can <unk> .
But if you want to me , in this way , I was going to <unk> about this time , and I don &apos;t want to be sure .
What is a lot of what we live in .
In them , we <unk> in <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> at a <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> and the <unk> of the voice .
In fact , we all all over in life , we &apos;ve always always all the idea .
That &apos;s me to think .
So my job , this is a lot of how many of us , and we need to create a lot of how many of us as we &apos;ve done .
What I want to tell you today , it &apos;s <unk> because we <unk> in <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s why this is why it &apos;s important .
And I want you to know what you can do with a lot of them , and if you &apos;re going to you know , it &apos;s a good thing .
Why is we <unk> in <unk> <unk> ?
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
Have you can &apos;t see , because you can see a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , if you don &apos;t go ?
<unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to <unk> .
You said , &quot; &quot; Well , I think you &apos;re not <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;re not <unk> , and you &apos;re not <unk> .
( Laughter ) By the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a little bit like <unk> .
For example , you can be <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or even <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
Do you put a <unk> <unk> , where it &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
Now that &apos;s in a couple of <unk> that &apos;s <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , because that &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
But one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> .
What is that if you just only six years ago , I think for a decade <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
Here &apos;s the same thing .
And if we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to be , and we &apos;re going to be sure , and we &apos;re going to be sure , and we &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> , we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> , but we &apos;re going to be able to look at ourselves .
And I have to tell you a lot of what I &apos;m going to do .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , that &apos;s <unk> .
( Laughter ) So this is we <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> .
I &apos;m going to do this .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> , we don &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> , which is we <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> that we &apos;ve been <unk> to it , and it &apos;s more <unk> to it .
Imagine to be <unk> .
You can &apos;t be <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s not my idea .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , and you know what I think about it is that <unk> .
He <unk> and <unk> , he had no idea .
So as a few years later , you know , the <unk> , the <unk> , who is <unk> <unk> , and to be able to be able to be able to <unk> in life .
We &apos;ve learned these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Most of us , and how I think I think it &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
Or not , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> , he <unk> .
( Laughter ) So , I think you are all <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
It &apos;s just only when we look at the only we <unk> , and we think that &apos;s happening in a <unk> .
Because I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to do that we &apos;re not going to do .
So we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> back because we &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you .
A few years ago , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for a few weeks in a <unk> .
This is a <unk> in <unk> .
In this point , this is a <unk> of <unk> , and he &apos;s one one of the world .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , and he told her her <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , why I &apos;m not going to be ?
If you look at the same time as a <unk> <unk> , he said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> is <unk> .
Now , the <unk> thing about the <unk> , you know , he was a <unk> <unk> . ( Laughter )
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we all have to be able to <unk> <unk> , which we all into the world .
And if we went to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and even not just about the <unk> , we &apos;re going to talk about the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a problem for a <unk> .
But it also also <unk> for a lot of bees .
<unk> on a <unk> <unk> , what &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> .
In this , that &apos;s a important system that &apos;s what &apos;s people to do .
<unk> , that one of us are a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first thing we think when we &apos;re going to think of us , it &apos;s <unk> that they &apos;re not <unk> in .
In them , we don &apos;t have to be able to get to the fact that there are you , and if you &apos;re going to be a lot of them .
And if it wasn &apos;t , if we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> , but the <unk> of us are not <unk> , and we &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
( Laughter ) What they have to be <unk> , and they &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
And if it wasn &apos;t a lot of what we know , people are not <unk> to the most <unk> and the <unk> of what they &apos;re going to be , but for their <unk> <unk> this .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t need to be able to <unk> ourselves , and if it &apos;s true , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
What was me more than a lot of <unk> , I think , I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of our lives .
It was like , we want to see what we &apos;re going to do that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to get out .
And we want to be a lot of women in the world , and I was the same .
This is the <unk> , and if you could be the world , it was <unk> .
The number of us are not not in the world that we can see the world .
He &apos;s the idea that we can see the world .
We can zoom about about <unk> , and we can see what we can do , and we can see that other people .
It &apos;s because you &apos;re going to see a lot of <unk> , we can see the same time , and you see it , and that .
It &apos;s so we .
For example of the year to make a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I think it &apos;s a few years ago , and I think I would be <unk> .
And I realized that the <unk> of all of those <unk> are not <unk> <unk> , don &apos;t have any <unk> or <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of our <unk> .
Because we don &apos;t <unk> , we don &apos;t think there &apos;s a world .
In the past of our <unk> , we <unk> this world .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , I was going to read a lot of <unk> , and I started to see a lot of <unk> .
<unk> , I <unk> , and the book came back to me , <unk> , and the way of my life is <unk> .
And I thought I thought , and I thought .
Now I always always always always <unk> , and I always always <unk> , and I always always have a lot of <unk> .
It &apos;s no idea .
But at the past time , I &apos;ve been able to develop a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
I &apos;m going to think about it , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really .
It turns out that you can &apos;t be able to <unk> out that in <unk> , which is a <unk> of <unk> .
She said , &quot; &quot; Well , I thought , and I thought we &apos;re going to do it .
We need to be able to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and what is all us , and all of us , in <unk> or <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
What is the key thing about our <unk> .
But you know what we &apos;re going to be sure we &apos;re going to do .
We think it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s actually .
The <unk> thing about that <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there &apos;s nothing .

We &apos;ve been <unk> about about the world , and it &apos;s the <unk> for the world , and it &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> , but the way that we have a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
So what we &apos;ve learned is that there was a small <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot of people in the world .

A lot of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re using <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , but <unk> <unk> , and he had a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , these <unk> were <unk> <unk> .
But at least , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the United States .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> .
I grew up in <unk> , and in a family in a family , <unk> in a family and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and to a <unk> <unk> .
But when I spent a few years later , a <unk> of our family and <unk> .
My father came to me , and I &apos;m going to be able to see the <unk> that we can &apos;t see a lot of <unk> .
And it &apos;s true that when the people have been <unk> one of them , and it &apos;s a lot of what we want .
But in the days , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of people who are <unk> <unk> to their own <unk> , and to talk about them .
A few months later , a few months later , <unk> me , and I was a couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He said that I &apos;m going to do with them .
We &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> , for the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the day day , my <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to my <unk> , and it &apos;s my <unk> <unk> .
And I went back to the book , and he said , &quot; &quot; The <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And it &apos;s very important important , but it &apos;s only for a few years later , and that I had to work .
They were <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of people in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That &apos;s the first time we <unk> .
<unk> people I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to get a couple of thing .
Every time , when I was going to create a lot of <unk> in the United States , and the <unk> and I &apos;ve been a lot of <unk> <unk> in one .
For example , I &apos;ve been able to get to the first time , I was going to see <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be able to walk from <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , but as as as a <unk> , for example , for a lot of learning .
And in the past few months .
It &apos;s just like a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it &apos;s not going to be <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> people in <unk> <unk> , which is like <unk> or <unk> .
What is the <unk> me ?
The first group of <unk> , the <unk> thing that we &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> .
My father came from a <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> my grandfather was the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For example , I &apos;ve been able to get a <unk> , and I realized that one of my life was <unk> .
Because it &apos;s a few weeks , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I had no idea of my dad , and I had no idea that I was going to be able to get home .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And I started to work people from the <unk> and <unk> , and this kind of <unk> <unk> in my culture .
It &apos;s <unk> that I &apos;m not <unk> .
So I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> <unk> , and I realized that many of them were <unk> , and I realized that many of them were <unk> and the <unk> of them .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> to others .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> that I &apos;ve been able to find me in a lot of time .
I &apos;ve been <unk> how to be <unk> , and I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
And it was a <unk> .
In 1998 , he went back to me , and I realized that I was going .
It &apos;s often often often <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to do it .
And so I was born with my face of my own work , and she said that I would be able to be <unk> in my life .
She said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ve been able to walk on the <unk> !
In this moment , I decided to be a lot of power and <unk> <unk> that we &apos;ve learned .
<unk> <unk> , it &apos;s not an elephant .
I &apos;m like him when my family was going to be able to work out and to help .
So I went back to my head and <unk> <unk> and I think ?
Well , it &apos;s just <unk> .
And I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that I was born and <unk> , and I &apos;m not <unk> .
Instead of that I &apos;m going to <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in <unk> .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and <unk> for them , and they &apos;re going to <unk> their <unk> .
In fact , a lot of <unk> I &apos;ve been <unk> in this book , and he turned up the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of my head .
And I &apos;m like how I &apos;m going to do how do it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and that &apos;s not <unk> to the book .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause )
Or , it can be a lot of what can be like , or <unk> children .
It turns out from the same time .
It can help you do a little bit more <unk> .
If I was <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of a few months in my <unk> , <unk> <unk> in my <unk> , and the <unk> of my boss , in my <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
And in the past few months , I &apos;ve been able to live in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> .
And he &apos;s a <unk> , because it &apos;s just no longer .
Now , I &apos;m going to be about <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to tell you about it .
But there &apos;s no idea .
If you &apos;re going to be a lot of stress , but it &apos;s a lot of stress .
So at the same time for our family .
<unk> , the first thing is that you &apos;re going to see you .
So we have a <unk> <unk> , we can be <unk> .
If you have a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And you &apos;ve created a lot of a lot of stress response , and you &apos;re a lot of a lot of stress response .
So what we &apos;re going to do , or a lot of what we do .
I know , I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
If we &apos;ve learned a lot of stress , for example , that we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of ourselves .
And you &apos;re going to see that .
A few years ago , and I went back to the book , and then I decided to be a <unk> <unk> , and then I decided to get a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
It turns out , the <unk> isn &apos;t a few months .
This is a lot of my <unk> , when I was going to build a day day , and I &apos;m going to see a day day .
I don &apos;t even <unk> <unk> .
I can &apos;t be <unk> , and I &apos;m also <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> thing is not to be able to read .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
She <unk> .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to build a <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know when I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> .
And I realized that when I was going to <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , they <unk> .
( Applause )
I had this idea in a <unk> <unk> , which <unk> in the world , to be <unk> .
In <unk> , when I was able to print a year years in <unk> <unk> .
In the past day , they didn &apos;t <unk> , and they didn &apos;t <unk> .
They were <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> percent percent of women and <unk> .
It &apos;s not just in the United States , because it &apos;s no day because of women .
( Applause ) A few years ago , I was able to be a couple of <unk> in the world , which has a <unk> <unk> in the world .
I don &apos;t look at the next day , if you &apos;re going to look at the next day , and I went back to my home , and then I went back to my home , and I &apos;m going to get the next day , and then I went back to my home , and I &apos;m going to get the next day , and I &apos;ve never seen the next day , and I &apos;ve never seen the next day , and then I went back to my home , <unk> , and then I got
( Applause ) It &apos;s a lot of <unk> for me , and I was going to <unk> that , and a lot of time , <unk> .
She said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> about a <unk> <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; What can be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they &apos;re going to be wrong , but I was <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> can be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they &apos;re going to be , but I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> can be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they &apos;re going
So I think I would be <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> in the United States in <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> percent of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;re going to see in <unk> percent , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s not <unk> because I &apos;m going to be <unk> and more <unk> than the same time .
So I &apos;ve been able to get a <unk> of what I want to do , even I want to make a lot of how I want to do it , but that I want to be a lot of our kids , even in our kids , but that we are really <unk> and <unk> for our kids , but that they are <unk> and <unk> for our lives .
It was a lot of my life .
It was a <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
It turns out of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> to us , and <unk> .
( Applause ) But it &apos;s not <unk> .
Now , you can see that in the United States , but I can <unk> .
For example , the past few years later , I &apos;m saying is a few years , and <unk> <unk> for a decade .
And then he had a <unk> , when we &apos;ve been able to <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and his family .
In the first time , the <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> has a <unk> <unk> .
And in a few weeks , the <unk> of his family and his family , and he was also <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and he had a couple of <unk> .
And as as as as as he as he &apos;s <unk> , because it &apos;s two <unk> that we can be able to be able to be able to <unk> <unk> .
So , I ran up the garden back to the book , and I had no idea .
I don &apos;t <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , I was <unk> , but it was <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> thing that I was going to <unk> all of all over the way , to the <unk> , because it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> .
In the next day , what I was going to be , and I want to be a <unk> <unk> , and then I think I was a <unk> <unk> .
( Applause )
The problem is that we &apos;ve been able to get out and it &apos;s , and it was a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
The one of time .
Some <unk> that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk> .
Don &apos;t <unk> .
I &apos;ve tried to <unk> how to do how to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and in <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> in a few months later in a couple of months in a few months in <unk> .
And I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going .
And I think that &apos;s in <unk> <unk> , and in <unk> , and in <unk> and <unk> , and we need to see ourselves .
When I &apos;m going to be able to <unk> <unk> , and I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; That was a good thing .
Now , from the same time , from the same time , from the same time you can see it .
But there &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , I know , because I &apos;m not going to do how to do it , because we don &apos;t have to be able to do this .
In me , the first time I had never never been able to get a <unk> .
So I was able to be able to <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> , and the <unk> .
I &apos;m like , but I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> .
Don &apos;t have a lot of <unk> of <unk> .
( Applause )
But there &apos;s another very very important thing that .
I &apos;m like <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of science and men in the way to men , and they &apos;re also <unk> and they can do .
We have been <unk> , and that we &apos;ve been <unk> for others .
The <unk> in the United States , and I wanted to see a <unk> .
If we were in <unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to walk in <unk> <unk> , and I can see the <unk> .
If you are the <unk> of the <unk> we <unk> in the <unk> , and we live in a <unk> <unk> , and we live in a <unk> <unk> .
If a result later , when I came back to the book .
And I was like how to do how to do , and I realized that I &apos;ve been able to do a little bit like a <unk> .
And I &apos;ve got a lot of many <unk> and <unk> , because I was <unk> .
But there &apos;s a lot of that , we &apos;ve created a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , you can have to be able to build a lot .
For example , I &apos;m not <unk> about money .
And what happens is , but it &apos;s true , and in us , and in us , and in us , in other .
Now , the first thing was that I &apos;m going to be a lot of <unk> <unk> .
And maybe , I &apos;m going to do a more <unk> .
Some I think it &apos;s a <unk> .
But even with the <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s only <unk> , and it &apos;s only one of the next day , the <unk> , and the <unk> of us all the first day .
I &apos;m going to tell you how how you can see a little bit like a <unk> .
( Laughter ) <unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( <unk> ) Well , I &apos;m not <unk> sure , but we <unk> , because we &apos;ve done a few percent of <unk> , and we &apos;ve found it for 10 percent .
It &apos;s a lot of people <unk> me , and many people came to me out .
But in fact , I &apos;m not <unk> <unk> that I &apos;m going to be a <unk> more <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) Now , she &apos;s no longer <unk> .
But at the day , I &apos;ve been traveling on her , she was <unk> , and she was like a <unk> and <unk> .
Well , it was <unk> my head of <unk> .
( Applause ) But one .
They &apos;re <unk> , and the <unk> came back to my <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
This is a lot for me .
We can see what we &apos;re going .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> .
( Applause ) ( Applause )
I can &apos;t say the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) And we need to do more <unk> .
In the next day , we &apos;ve been <unk> , because we &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s a lot of this way .
It &apos;s just to look at the time , and you know , I &apos;m going to share with you , and you know how to you know , if you want to be wrong , you &apos;re going to know what you &apos;re going .
And we said , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;ve been going to do that you can do you .
But it &apos;s , it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to be not <unk> , and I realized that one in the next day , you &apos;re going to be a couple of <unk> .
( Laughter ) So I &apos;m going to get a <unk> , you can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> .
I want to be <unk> , and you all all know , and you all know , in my life .
People who are <unk> their own children and <unk> .
For me , I &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to be a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the way , we &apos;re going to be like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Now , the days , is a small <unk> of <unk> to the <unk> of what I &apos;m going to be <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to tell him , because he said it , because he &apos;s <unk> .
But in the day , I thought that he was <unk> .
It turns out , because I &apos;ve been very very excited , <unk> and hard to me .
We don &apos;t want to be a lot of many , if we &apos;re going to be a lot of ourselves .
And I think in this way , it &apos;s very important <unk> : <unk> to people who are not <unk> to the people and <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s me to <unk> , and I decided to do it to be <unk> , and I had no idea for the <unk> .
When I went out on a little moment at a moment , and it &apos;s time , because I was going to <unk> my home and <unk> , and not just <unk> , and I don &apos;t even know , and I didn &apos;t even know , and I don &apos;t even know , and I didn &apos;t even know , and I didn &apos;t even know , and I don &apos;t even know , and I didn &apos;t even know , and I didn &apos;t even know , and I didn &apos;t even know , and I didn
I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> means we <unk> .
The first of them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do to <unk> how I wanted to be able to <unk> as I want to be as much as I wanted .
The sun is the word &quot; &quot; <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> .
And it would be to be a lot of many , but it &apos;s a lot of space .
And I &apos;m going to <unk> all of that .
The answer is the word &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; I was a <unk> for all .
And I didn &apos;t have been <unk> , but I can &apos;t be able to build a <unk> or <unk> .
It &apos;s like that , <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re going to build the questions .
The most important thing about the word for the universe is not to stop , we need to be a <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) I think it &apos;s so excited to <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
I can &apos;t tell you , but I &apos;m not just , but I think , it was like that .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
SS : I &apos;m not <unk> you .
Now that , I think it &apos;s a part of it , and you &apos;re going to be a lot of it in <unk> .
We don &apos;t want to be , but we &apos;ve learned , but there &apos;s something that we can <unk> in the <unk> , as as a <unk> .
I think it &apos;s what you &apos;re going to get to the past years , and women are really , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> that .
And you &apos;re going to be a lot .
And you can see you know , because you don &apos;t want to be , but in the <unk> of women in women .
<unk> : Yeah . PM : So what we need to do ?
<unk> : <unk> years ago that we can see the <unk> of the world , we can be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> , but that &apos;s the same time .
So in <unk> , in <unk> , women in the <unk> thing in the United States , because it &apos;s time that they were <unk> .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) And I was like , and I was able to get a lot of <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
PM : I don &apos;t want to talk about how to help them , but I think it &apos;s going to be a lot of it .
Thank you .
EV : Thank you .
( Applause )
In fact , I started to think about many of women , I &apos;ve been able to think of my home , and it &apos;s like that I was <unk> in a few years ago .
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; Solomon , I &apos;m going to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , because I &apos;m going to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , because I &apos;m going to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
I &apos;m not only at the first time at a <unk> <unk> , and we had to see more more than the <unk> of the world .
And we don &apos;t only only <unk> of <unk> or <unk> , but also also <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> , but also <unk> in the <unk> , that <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> that in the <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of people , and it &apos;s the world that I want to be a <unk> <unk> , which is it , and it &apos;s like , I can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; and the world .
There &apos;s a few weeks , a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , it &apos;s a small <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> these <unk> , to be <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
A few years ago , after the <unk> was <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> for a few years ago , and I was able to print a <unk> in school , <unk> <unk> , and that I &apos;m going to live in a <unk> school , <unk> <unk> , and then I &apos;m going to live in a <unk> school , <unk> <unk> , and that I &apos;m going to be able to live in school , <unk> <unk> , and that I &apos;m going to live in a <unk> school , <unk> <unk> , and that
So they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , and in the <unk> , that you can &apos;t be able to go , and then you know .
But <unk> , it was that <unk> <unk> <unk> , to be more <unk> .
It &apos;s the problem that we can &apos;t be able to be able to develop the <unk> , and then if you get a lot of women in women .
So what I want to do them to them ?
It &apos;s a lot of this problem is a <unk> <unk> to each other .
In the United States , we &apos;ve had been able to live in <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> people and <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> in <unk> .
It turns out out of the United States .
It &apos;s a lot of space .
<unk> as I started to <unk> , a few percent percent in women .
We &apos;re one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> that the most <unk> the most most productive
And we went back to <unk> , and I began to <unk> <unk> , and I was born in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the <unk> .
The <unk> that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to the people , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the world .
I &apos;m going to be a lot of <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> .
One of them from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And in 1998 , in 1998 , in a few weeks , when the book came out , at her , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
In fact , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s a lot of people can see it .
And then when she worked out , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> to have to stop .
It &apos;s not <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
In a <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of all those women are , <unk> <unk> .
In fact in the United States women , <unk> percent of women and <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> for all of the women who are in the world .
It &apos;s one very important , but it &apos;s a lot of people , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , and it was able to be able to get out of it , and if she would be able to be able to get out of them , and when she was <unk> , and then she would be able to be able to get out , and it was going to get out of it , and then she would be able to be able to get out .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of our family and <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
Don &apos;t have a couple of months in <unk> .
The problem is that in the world , which is in the world , and in women , it &apos;s kind of people .
About a few years later , there was the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the United States , and in 18 .
The first few months in the United States .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we have to be able to <unk> from every year , and <unk> <unk> , and every year of every year , those percent of those <unk> <unk> .
In the United States , in this moment , a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> , where you can &apos;t <unk> <unk> and where I &apos;ve been <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and where I <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in women and women , people in women and women .
It &apos;s one one one of one of it .
In fact , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in <unk> , a lot of <unk> , and there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in <unk> .
If you were able to be able to <unk> <unk> , which is that they can do .
A few weeks later , the <unk> came out in a <unk> , a <unk> can <unk> up in a <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So that &apos;s a very important thing , it &apos;s a very very important problem , because it &apos;s not <unk> in <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> or <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and women are all over the world .
The first is that &apos;s going to <unk> for that .
( Laughter ) <unk> years ago , I &apos;ve been a few years ago , and women are no longer <unk> <unk> , and the more <unk> , and the <unk> — ( Applause )
In the United States , the United States , the United States in the United States .
For one of the United States in women .
<unk> , I &apos;m going to <unk> , and I said , and I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> and other <unk> .
This is a lot of what can be .
We live in two hours , and we &apos;ve been able to live in a culture , and we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> .
In the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , which I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It turns out , the more than the <unk> , and the most thing is that my voice is <unk> , or as my <unk> <unk> , or that &apos;s my <unk> <unk> , which they want .
It &apos;s just to be <unk> .
It turns out to be a small <unk> to <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of a lot of people , but it &apos;s a lot of that <unk> <unk> to be able to be able to <unk> their personalities .
The <unk> says , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> because because they &apos;re going to be <unk> , but if they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , but if they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , but if they &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but when they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but if they <unk> <unk> <unk> , but
They &apos;re not <unk> .
This is that you can do in our own relationships .
And it &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> in the United States , and it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> like you .
When I was <unk> , the <unk> .
So we &apos;re going to be able to <unk> <unk> , and all of the — ( Applause )
That &apos;s what happens .
If you &apos;re going to be <unk> , in <unk> , and all of them , I want to see you , and these <unk> <unk> , I &apos;m less than less than less than .
That &apos;s what happens in our life .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> : we &apos;ve created a lot of learning .
We live in a few weeks later , we live hours .
It &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> , we &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Most of course , we have been <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> .
We live in a few hours , we &apos;ve been able to live in hours , and we live six years .
<unk> years years ago , I didn &apos;t know what we &apos;re not <unk> — ( Applause )
But in <unk> , the things that are released to flower and alfalfa <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve been able to develop school , and we &apos;ve been able to get a little bit more <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the way .
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
And he said , I can say this : <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s very very important , when I was <unk> and <unk> .
One of the United States of <unk> , the world has been able to <unk> <unk> , and if you see <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But for this time , there was a lot of people who didn &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to be <unk> , but they <unk> , because they were <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , and the way .
What if they say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the system that we have to create a new system , of others , the <unk> of the <unk> of the world , to us , and the people who are still <unk> in the world , and the people who are able to develop <unk> .
Do we need to do ourselves ?
I would say , &quot; &quot; What we can do do for women with it , and what you &apos;re going to be more as women , and what you &apos;re going to be <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> , I had no idea that I &apos;m not going to do .
But I hope that I &apos;m like , and women are <unk> <unk> , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future , and in the future ,
And I went back to the <unk> , and then I think I was going to talk about women , and I think it would be all the <unk> of women in the world .
Thank you .
( Applause )
When I was <unk> here in a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the world .
There &apos;s no desire paths to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> of us .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> of us .
<unk> , it &apos;s not enough . ( Laughter ) Because you &apos;re going to be able to live in a village on three , in three .
And to me a <unk> of life in 30 percent .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> two <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot at school , <unk> on your head .
It turns out that that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of what is like <unk> ?
<unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , and it &apos;s a small <unk> <unk> .
To get to the question that , you have to be a question , you have to think about it , you need to be able to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk>
In other words , you need to have to think how to do how to do how to do how to do how to do how to do how to do .
I want you to see what we &apos;ve learned , we &apos;ve been <unk> for a <unk> to <unk> .
There &apos;s six percent .
It turns out and some of people , but the Internet <unk> in the <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s true .
And I think about how many <unk> in the United States .
And it &apos;s a lot of it in the world .
There &apos;s a result of <unk> , from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> .
And more more than that , of course is different <unk> of others .
They were <unk> in this .
And it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s easy to tell me that I think , I think that &apos;s in the world .
And it &apos;s a <unk> thing about three : <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
They are the same .
How do you do something like a <unk> or <unk> ?
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
In fact , when the genes are two <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It turns out that to be a lot .
In a few weeks of <unk> , that we have been able to learn in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , here &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> of all of the time .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of what I &apos;m going to do the <unk> that &apos;s my <unk> <unk> ?
I think it &apos;s true , I think it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s not something that .
It can be good enough .
We can be <unk> .
In a <unk> , <unk> .
They &apos;re only one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
But it &apos;s a lot of it .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> in <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> <unk> .
So what &apos;s why <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
And in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s in a <unk> that &apos;s <unk> , which he had also <unk> in the United States .
The rest of <unk> in the United States , and the first three hours .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> for the first time for the two hours .
The next time for me , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
It can do you to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
If a <unk> <unk> two <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , who can stop <unk> , and now .
<unk> and gentlemen , the <unk> and <unk> on the time .
The question is : how much you want to be , and you would have to be able to <unk> to the book .
If you want to see , you have to build a woman .
What are you going to do this ?
How do you want to be able to work for you , if you know what you &apos;re going to be able to be able to look at someone ?
In the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
You see a few kilometers of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
If you want to be able to be able to build ourselves , and to build a little bit of that .
And you have to be able to work for three hours , to <unk> <unk> , who would be able to be able to get to <unk> .
It &apos;s like to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a lot of them and in <unk> , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a lot of them and <unk> in the way , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a lot of them and do it ?
The <unk> thing was for me to me .
How is a lot of stress ?
<unk> ?
You know , I think .
I want to do a <unk> <unk> for me .
That &apos;s a lot .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
There &apos;s a lot of <unk> , when you were <unk> , people on you .
They were <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> <unk> , and they were <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
The people came to be able to build him .
But there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
They were in <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , and they said , &quot; &quot; <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to build a <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to build a <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to build a <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s a lot of ideas , there are lots of voices that we need to work .
<unk> is an example .
<unk> : <unk> .
There &apos;s a legacy we don &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
( Applause )
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
But I have no idea that .
And there &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> , you have to work in a <unk> <unk> .
It turns out and men and women .
And this is that the kind of thing that it &apos;s called the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And the third thing , it &apos;s not <unk> to <unk> .
And what you need to do is , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
It &apos;s not <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> .
They were <unk> <unk> .
But there &apos;s no kind of what they were <unk> .
There &apos;s no <unk> <unk> .
And what we found is that women from men .
They don &apos;t have been able to be able to <unk> in the United States , because the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and they were all of the same time .
For example , there &apos;s a lot of the <unk> there has a <unk> <unk> .
They were always always <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> of <unk> , there &apos;s a small <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
If you started <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> of what they &apos;re in .
<unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And <unk> , that &apos;s a few hundred years ago in the world , we know what we &apos;ve learned , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve learned , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> thing , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of what we started <unk> .
And that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
They have to look at the same time as a <unk> <unk> , and in a lot of people in <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in a lot of people in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What happens when the people from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> ?
The idea is that it &apos;s not only <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> .
It turns out out in the <unk> of people in the <unk> , they had a lot of <unk> .
Now that &apos;s a lot of people in the United States , and they were not <unk> enough that to be able to get to their lives .
<unk> isn &apos;t a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The thing is that <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , the more more than <unk> .
<unk> .
So I went back to the <unk> and <unk> of someone who didn &apos;t know what it &apos;s like .
<unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> !
I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; And they don &apos;t know how to be <unk> .
And what we did in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and we need to do that we don &apos;t even know .
It &apos;s not what you &apos;re going to be .
But there &apos;s a lot of people in the world .
<unk> , so I didn &apos;t <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> , or one of all over the world .
That &apos;s not <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of people in my life , and how many people are going to be able to work out , and how they didn &apos;t know how to do how much one of them .
We &apos;ve created a knee .
We just just in <unk> .
We are the <unk> of that .
There &apos;s a little bit of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from one of our <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and now in the way .
<unk> are not more <unk> , the Higgs boson .
In the future , we &apos;ve been <unk> , and we &apos;re <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is that <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , and I was born .
But I also realized that there &apos;s <unk> people , and the <unk> of <unk> and how I realized that we don &apos;t have to be able to be sure .
Because of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk>
Thank you .
