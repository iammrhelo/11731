He wasn &apos;t even <unk> , and they need to get to the next time .
That &apos;s why why I was <unk> .
My mother was <unk> .
There &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
Well , I &apos;m going to get to my eyes .
And I found out of women , and I live in a <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
If I was <unk> to the next time .
I wanted to be able to be <unk> to help and help them .
So , here &apos;s what I &apos;ve been going to get to the way .
For example , I had no idea in <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) And I went in <unk> .
I grew up in <unk> .

And then I <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you know , when I &apos;m saying , I didn &apos;t know what I was going to my family and with my <unk> .
A few months , I had no idea .
My family was in <unk> .
As it &apos;s only <unk> <unk> , <unk> my family in a <unk> .
And I wanted to talk about them , and I wanted to be a <unk> .
So I was going to do this ?
It was in <unk> .
And when I think it &apos;s a lot of my <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
And I thought I wanted to be able to <unk> my <unk> , and I realized that I &apos;m not going to do that .
I &apos;m going to work .
The <unk> of <unk> .
And here &apos;s my <unk> to <unk> .
When I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
About a few percent of them , they were able to live in and men , and then we &apos;ve been in <unk> <unk> , and when I was in <unk> <unk> <unk> , and when I was in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when I started home , I &apos;ve been <unk> that I &apos;m going to do .
I &apos;m going to walk from the <unk> of <unk> , and it wasn &apos;t .
I &apos;m going to get a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to the <unk> , and that &apos;s not only for life .
I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and they were <unk> and <unk> and they were <unk> .
It was a very <unk> <unk> .
And that moment we did .
And I think I can say , &quot; What do I do how to do people ?
How do I can help them ?
And that moment , I realized that it &apos;s going to my life .
It was like me , <unk> me .
And that moment , I realized that we need to be able to be able to do .
So what I was going ?
Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a lot of power <unk> .
And so that &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
And I was like , &quot; &quot; I want to do . &quot; &quot; I want to do . &quot;
Do I &apos;m going ? I &apos;m not .
This is why I was going to be <unk> .
How do I do this ?
And I went back and , and I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> .

He was six years .
He was a <unk> .
I was born in him a <unk> <unk> .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a lot of you .
A few years later , we &apos;ve been able to live in a year , and one of the <unk> , we were able to get to these people who are <unk> .

So , we have to see , we &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
I was in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And I &apos;m going to see how I &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> ! &quot; &quot; If you said , &quot; &quot; If you are what you &apos;re going ?
You see . You know what this is <unk> .

So we &apos;ve got a lot of stress .
And the Koran says , when you look at the next time , you said , &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) <unk> , they were <unk> at the next time . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And they started <unk> .
And in this moment , I came out of them .

In this point of us , we &apos;ve been <unk> .
And it &apos;s not <unk> , if you need to be able to be sure .

I think it &apos;s true .
I live in a book , who was a <unk> .
I want to share with you .
That &apos;s a lot of what &apos;s happening .
We &apos;ve learned that time .
Do you know what happened to me ?
Today , people can &apos;t be able to <unk> <unk> .
But we want to be able to <unk> to our <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Yes , I can &apos;t be <unk> .
I want to share with you , and I want to share with you .
And he said that , and then you can see the universe .
<unk> : What &apos;s happening ?
<unk> : Well , it &apos;s good .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and that &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> .

<unk> : <unk> <unk> ?
We &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> you .
( Applause ) My name : I &apos;m going to walk out in the <unk> , and I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I thought , who &apos;s <unk> .
In the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> who are not <unk> .
And I realized that <unk> — it &apos;s the <unk> that I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be <unk> ! &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , and I don &apos;t know , and I don &apos;t know how I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to be <unk> ! &quot;
It &apos;s <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
But there &apos;s a result of this is called <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
So what we have to do that they are going to do to <unk> ?
So it &apos;s called <unk> .
When I was <unk> years old , <unk> <unk> me , and I &apos;m going to get a few years .
So in me , I &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> to build a <unk> .
It &apos;s like <unk> , I &apos;ve been <unk> on the <unk> , and I &apos;m going to be able to build a <unk> <unk> .
I can &apos;t see <unk> , what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) She &apos;s about the bees , and it &apos;s all .
If you were able to <unk> out of these <unk> , <unk> all of us , and we &apos;re <unk> <unk> , we would be <unk> .
So I decided to <unk> these and how to do them .
( Applause ) ( Applause ) <unk> : <unk> !
We need to be <unk> !
( Video ) Thank you . ( Applause )
<unk> can be <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
If you don &apos;t even know , we don &apos;t even know where we don &apos;t even know where they were going to be able to <unk> or <unk> , not <unk> .
When I was <unk> years old , I &apos;ve been able to print a few years , and I &apos;ve been able to <unk> years later , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> for them .
( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m going to be a lot of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , which is that I &apos;m going to be <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and I &apos;m going to build a <unk> <unk> .
There &apos;s a lot of time I have been <unk> <unk> , and I wanted to print a <unk> <unk> , and I wanted to <unk> it .
A few months later , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , I &apos;m like , and I was going to do this <unk> .
And I realized that when I was going to <unk> my <unk> , and I realized the <unk> in the <unk> .
I &apos;m like , and I thought that I can do .
Because I was just only a few years later , <unk> <unk> in me .
I had just know what I want to be <unk> <unk> to be <unk> , and that I want to share with a lot of people in life .
<unk> <unk> <unk> me , and I was <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in my <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> and <unk> for them .
I &apos;m going to get a more <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> started to the world .
And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I had to talk a lot of <unk> <unk> , like , like , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and how many people are going to be able to be able to be able to get a lot of ourselves .
<unk> <unk> .
And one of time when I was 10 years old , and I was <unk> <unk> .
( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
So what I &apos;m going to be <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> , I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> and <unk> in them .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
And I think what &apos;s a lot of how much you &apos;ve been done a lot of people , and I started home , and I went back and I was going to get back and <unk> and <unk> , and then I went back and I was going to be <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> , it &apos;s his <unk> for it , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
So when I started to <unk> , I was able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , and that &apos;s <unk> percent of my <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
( Applause ) I think it &apos;s a small <unk> of <unk> , who didn &apos;t want to be better .
And I realized that I can <unk> my <unk> to become more <unk> .
We live in a place where we live in the world , and it &apos;s a lot more <unk> , and it &apos;s a lot more .
<unk> is what I had in the world , and it &apos;s not enough .
And we need to be able to <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s called the <unk> .
It turns out and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world .
Thank you , you can <unk> .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) They said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I was born ?
If you &apos;re <unk> and <unk> <unk> , you can be <unk> .
( Applause )
This is a few weeks , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be able to be able to increase in <unk> .
Most of you can see in the United States , it &apos;s not <unk> .
Now , you think of some of those <unk> , I thought , I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re going .
<unk> like the <unk> <unk> .
And in the <unk> of <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that you can see , and you can see it .
And I think there are three hours , and the first thing is that <unk> to be a very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So what &apos;s how to do ?
You see , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of <unk> that you &apos;re going to get out of his <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s like .
And if you want to see , you can see a little bit like a <unk> .
To don &apos;t be <unk> that we &apos;re going to be a <unk> more than one of the United States .
It &apos;s <unk> , how to be all these things .
But more importantly , they have <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and when you see <unk> , we can think about them as a <unk> .
And there &apos;s a lot of <unk> that we &apos;ve been able to live in ourselves , and they said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s a lot of <unk> ? &quot;
If you will be able to be able to build these questions .
Well , that we said , &quot; &quot; Well , that , we said , &quot;
The first thing is that these is <unk> .
Well , when the <unk> of us are the <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and then we get this , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
That &apos;s the forest .
And what we &apos;re here is , it &apos;s great <unk> .
The question is , if it doesn &apos;t mean , if it doesn &apos;t mean what we &apos;re going ?
And the first thing about a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
And it &apos;s a lot of <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of these numbers are the <unk> of what we &apos;re going to be able to apply to college , and they &apos;re like <unk> , is <unk> .
This is this is , but it &apos;s just the <unk> <unk> .
Now , there &apos;s also lots of those <unk> that we &apos;ve created for us , <unk> , and then we see the <unk> of us .
<unk> is a very important thing .
To do you think about it , I have to tell you about it .
Most of the United States is not <unk> .
It &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
Most of our <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> thing is that not very good , but as you can &apos;t very very much good , but for you , and <unk> , we have a lot more about that .
If you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , you know , you &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , you can see ourselves .
And it &apos;s not <unk> .
So how we can do it ?
To To look at this question , I think I &apos;m going to say , &quot; What if you want to be <unk> ? &quot;
There &apos;s a <unk> .
We &apos;ve been <unk> , we &apos;re going to be a <unk> <unk> , just just a <unk> .
They &apos;re <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s what you can &apos;t see in this <unk> .
<unk> is , and you can see see , and you can see see a lot .
So what &apos;s happening here , is a <unk> <unk> , very very very very important , very , very very very important , it &apos;s very very very important .
And it &apos;s very important important , because it &apos;s very important <unk> , it &apos;s very very very important <unk> that we can &apos;t see a <unk> .
Well , it &apos;s very important thing .
<unk> , why are the <unk> of <unk> , we need to talk about what we do .
EV : Yeah .
It turns out out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you have a lot more , it should be to be .
If I was <unk> <unk> , I thought it &apos;s <unk> .
But I &apos;m not <unk> that he can &apos;t be <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> thing is a <unk> <unk> .
They don &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
They &apos;re going to be able to <unk> <unk> and <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of the question that are <unk> , is what we &apos;re going to be able to increase in <unk> ?
In her feet , and it &apos;s a lot of your <unk> <unk> .
And the problem is in the United States , which is that <unk> .
There &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
We need to do it .
I &apos;m going to think about it .
And as as as as as a <unk> , the most important thing is , it &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> <unk> that .
For example , the rest of the <unk> .
So I want to be a lot of the United States in the United States , and the <unk> of his <unk> <unk> , and all of the <unk> — that these are <unk> .
<unk> , I <unk> my hand , but you can see a lot of a <unk> <unk> .
But what I started to do what I was like , how I &apos;m going to be a <unk> <unk> , and then we have to know how how I &apos;m going to do them , but how do them them in , but how they want them .
What is a lot of you , I &apos;m going to be <unk> <unk> , and it was time .
That &apos;s what he said , &quot; &quot; If I want to be able to go out , and they say , &quot; &quot; <unk> , our <unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> .
And there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
They &apos;re not <unk> .
They need to be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Yeah , we need to be <unk> , we need to be <unk> , but we need to be able to talk about ourselves , and we need to talk about ourselves .
And to me , I &apos;m going to do this , and I &apos;m going to be the way to do .
( Applause )
Yeah , what you &apos;re going to be in a village in New York , and the <unk> of <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; <unk> <unk> .
You said , &quot; &quot; <unk> .
It &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and this is said , &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Solomon .
<unk> .
This is , and we &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re going to get out in the street , and in fact , <unk> and said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is what we &apos;re going ?
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , and they said , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; And they said
<unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
I think it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s just just <unk> the world .
And you said , &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , this is just <unk> .
I said , &quot; &quot; For the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , which was the <unk> in a few weeks , one is one of one .
The <unk> that was a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
There &apos;s a few weeks , it &apos;s a few hours .
So , in fact , there &apos;s a lot of people in the United States , what are the most important thing that is their health .
So , if you don &apos;t see , you can &apos;t see you , and if you &apos;re not <unk> , because they don &apos;t afraid they &apos;re not <unk> .
( Applause )
But in the <unk> , we said , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> .
You can &apos;t think it &apos;s not just in <unk> , but in the way , how they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and in fact , how they are <unk> <unk> , for three , three .
And this is also <unk> .
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) <unk> , in the way that we have about <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> , which is one of <unk> .
So we &apos;re not <unk> that if you don &apos;t know that if you &apos;re going to be able to <unk> , or a lot of what it can be .
<unk> <unk> .
