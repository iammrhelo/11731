It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005 .
I was working at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U as the organization &apos;s science ad@@ vis@@ or .
I really , really loved my job , but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit disc@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged .
So I wand@@ ered down the hall@@ way to my colleague Chris H@@ ans@@ en &apos;s office .
Chris had been at the A@@ C@@ L@@ U for more than 30 years , so he had deep institu@@ tional knowledge and insights .
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck .
I had been investi@@ gating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liber@@ ties — super interesting .
But I wanted the A@@ C@@ L@@ U to engage these issues in a much bigger way , in a way that could really make a difference .
So Chris cut right to the cha@@ se , and he says , &quot; Well , of all the issues you &apos;ve been looking at , what are the top five ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , there &apos;s genetic discrimination , and re@@ productive technologies , and bi@@ ob@@ an@@ king , and ...
oh , there &apos;s this really cool issue , functional MRI and using it for lie detection , and ...
oh , and of course , there &apos;s gene pat@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; Gen@@ e pat@@ ents ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , you know , pat@@ ents on human genes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; No !
You &apos;re telling me that the US government has been issu@@ ing pat@@ ents on part of the human body ?
That can &apos;t be right . &quot; &quot; I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles .
And 20 minutes later , he came bur@@ sting in my office .
&quot; Oh my go@@ d ! You &apos;re right ! Who can we su@@ e ? &quot;
( Laughter ) Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but I wasn &apos;t even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a law@@ suit .
First , we needed to understand exactly what was pat@@ ented when someone pat@@ ented a gene .
Gen@@ e pat@@ ents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversi@@ al of these are to so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA &quot; &quot; — namely , a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell .
Gen@@ e patent prop@@ on@@ ents say , &quot; &quot; See ? We didn &apos;t patent the gene in your body , we pat@@ ented an isolated gene . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated .
And the pat@@ ents weren &apos;t just to a particular gene that they isolated , but on every possible version of that gene .
So what does that mean ?
That means that you can &apos;t give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it , say , to see if it has any mutations , without permission of the patent hol@@ der .
It also means that the patent hol@@ der has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing .
Al@@ lowing patent hol@@ ders , often private companies , to lock up stret@@ ches of the human genome was har@@ ming patients .
Consider A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , a 10@@ -year-old with long Q@@ T syndrome , a serious heart condition that , if left un@@ treated , can result in sudden death .
The company that ob@@ tained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diag@@ nose the syndrome .
But then they went ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt and they never offered it .
So another lab tried to offer the test , but the company that held the pat@@ ents threatened to su@@ e the lab for patent infr@@ in@@ ge@@ ment .
So as a result , for 2 years , no test was available .
During that time , A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il died of un@@ diagnosed long Q@@ T .
Gen@@ e pat@@ ents clearly were a problem and were har@@ ming patients .
But was there a way we could challenge them ?
Tur@@ ns out that the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t has made clear through a long line of cases , that certain things are not patent e@@ li@@ gible .
You can &apos;t patent products of nature — the air , the water , min@@ erals , elements of the peri@@ o@@ dic table .
And you can &apos;t patent laws of nature — the law of gravity , E = m@@ c@@ 2 .
These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and re@@ served excl@@ usi@@ vely to none .
It seemed to us that DNA , the most fundamental structure of life , that co@@ des for the production of all of our proteins , is both a product of nature and a law of nature , regardless of whether it &apos;s in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube .
As we del@@ ved into this issue , we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts — scientists , medical professionals , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
All of them thought our chances of winning a gen@@ e-@@ patent challenge were about zero .
Why is that ?
Well , the patent office had been issu@@ ing these pat@@ ents for more than 20 years .
There were literally thousands of pat@@ ents on human genes .
The patent bar was deeply entr@@ en@@ ched in the status qu@@ o , the bi@@ ot@@ ech industry had grown up around this practice , and legislation to ban gene pat@@ ents had been introduced year after year in Congress , and had gone absolutely nowhere .
So the bottom line : cour@@ ts just weren &apos;t going to be willing to over@@ turn these pat@@ ents .
Now , neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge , and hearing , &quot; &quot; Being right just isn &apos;t enough , &quot; &quot; seemed all the more reason to take on this fight .
So we set out to build our case .
Now , patent cases tend to be : Com@@ p@@ any A su@@ es Com@@ p@@ any B over some really narrow , obsc@@ ure technical issue .
We weren &apos;t really interested in that kind of case , and we thought this case was much bigger than that .
This was about scientific freedom , medical progress , the rights of patients .
So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case — more like a civil rights case .
We set out to identify a gen@@ e-@@ patent hol@@ der that was vi@@ gor@@ ously enfor@@ cing its pat@@ ents and then to organize a broad co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ inti@@ ffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these pat@@ ents were har@@ ming patients and innovation .
We found the prime candidate to su@@ e in My@@ ri@@ ad G@@ ene@@ tics , a company that &apos;s based in Sal@@ t L@@ ake City , U@@ ta@@ h .
My@@ ri@@ ad held pat@@ ents on two genes , the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 1 and the B@@ R@@ C@@ A@@ 2 genes .
Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
My@@ ri@@ ad had used its pat@@ ents to maintain a complete mon@@ op@@ o@@ ly on B@@ R@@ CA testing in the United States .
It had forced multiple labs that were offering B@@ R@@ CA testing to stop .
It charged a lot of money for its test — over 3,000 dollars .
It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community .
And perhaps worst of all , for a period of several years , My@@ ri@@ ad refused to up@@ date its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France .
It has been estimated that during that period , for several years , as many as 12 percent of women under@@ going testing received the wrong answer — a negative test result that should have been positive .
This is K@@ athle@@ en Ma@@ xi@@ an .
K@@ athle@@ en &apos;s sister E@@ ile@@ en developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by My@@ ri@@ ad .
The test was negative .
The family was reli@@ ev@@ ed .
That meant that E@@ ile@@ en &apos;s cancer most likely didn &apos;t run in the family , and that other members of her family didn &apos;t need to be tested .
But two years later , K@@ athle@@ en was diagnosed with adv@@ ance@@ d-@@ stage o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
It turned out that K@@ athle@@ en &apos;s sister was among the 12 percent who received a fal@@ se@@ -@@ negative test result .
H@@ ad E@@ ile@@ en received the proper result , K@@ athle@@ en would have then been tested , and her o@@ vari@@ an cancer could have been preven@@ ted .
Once we sett@@ led on My@@ ri@@ ad , we then had to form a co@@ ali@@ tion of pla@@ inti@@ ffs and experts that could ill@@ umin@@ ate these problems .
We ended up with 20 highly committed pla@@ inti@@ ffs : genetic counsel@@ ors , gene@@ tici@@ sts who had received ce@@ ase and des@@ ist letters , advoca@@ cy organizations , four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 15@@ 0,000 scientists and medical professionals , and individual women who either couldn &apos;t afford My@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s test , or who wanted to ob@@ tain a second opinion but could not , as a result of the pat@@ ents .
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
So in order to argue that what My@@ ri@@ ad did was not an invention , and that isolated B@@ R@@ CA genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like : What &apos;s a gene ? What &apos;s DNA ?
How is DNA isolated , and why isn &apos;t that an invention ?
We spent hours and hours with our pla@@ inti@@ ffs and experts , trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately .
And we ended up rel@@ ying heavi@@ ly on the use of metaph@@ ors , like gold .
So isol@@ ating DNA — it &apos;s like extrac@@ ting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed .
You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold , but you can &apos;t patent the gold itself .
It might &apos;ve taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain ; you still can &apos;t patent it , it &apos;s still gold .
And the gold , once it &apos;s extrac@@ ted , can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn &apos;t be used for when it was in the mountain ; you can make je@@ wel@@ ry out of it for example — still can &apos;t patent the gold , it &apos;s still gold .
So now it &apos;s 2009 , and we &apos;re ready to file our case .
We fil@@ ed in federal court in the Southern Di@@ stri@@ ct of New York , and the case was randomly as@@ signed to Ju@@ dge Robert Swe@@ et .
In March 2010 , Ju@@ dge Swe@@ et issu@@ ed his opinion — 15@@ 2 pages — and a complete vic@@ tory for our side .
In reading the opinion , we could not get over how el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently he described the science in the case .
I mean , our brief — it was pretty good , but not this good .
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time ?
We just could not compreh@@ end how this had happened .
So it turned out , Ju@@ dge Swe@@ et &apos;s cl@@ er@@ k working for him at the time , was not just a lawyer — he was a scientist .
He was not just a scientist — he had a PhD in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) What an incredible stroke of luck !
My@@ ri@@ ad then appe@@ aled to the US C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the Fe@@ deral C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it .
And here things got really interesting .
First , in a pi@@ vot@@ al moment of this case , the US government swit@@ ched sides .
So in the district court the government sub@@ mitted a brief on My@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s side .
But now in direct op@@ position to its own patent office , the US government fil@@ es a brief that states that is has re@@ considered this issue in light of the district court &apos;s opinion , and has conclu@@ ded that isolated DNA is not patent e@@ li@@ gible .
This was a really big deal , totally unexpected .
The C@@ our@@ t of Ap@@ pe@@ als for the Fe@@ deral C@@ ir@@ cu@@ it hear@@ s all patent cases , and it has a reputation for being very , very pro@@ -@@ patent .
So even with this remarkable development , we expected to lose .
And we did .
S@@ ort of .
En@@ ds up split decision , 2 to 1 .
But the two jud@@ ges who rul@@ ed against us , did so for completely different reasons .
The first one , Ju@@ dge L@@ ouri@@ e , made up his own novel , biological theory — totally wrong .
( Laughter ) He decided My@@ ri@@ ad had created a new chemical — made absolutely no sense .
My@@ ri@@ ad didn &apos;t even argue this , so it came out of the blue .
The other , Ju@@ dge Mo@@ ore , said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature .
But she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to shake up the bi@@ ot@@ ech industry . &quot; &quot; The third , Ju@@ dge Br@@ y@@ son , agreed with us .
And when you petition the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t , you have to present a question that you want the C@@ our@@ t to answer .
U@@ su@@ ally these questions take the form of a super-@@ long par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h , like a whole page long with lots and lots of cl@@ a@@ uses , &quot; wher@@ e@@ in this &quot; and &quot; therefore that . &quot;
We sub@@ mitted perhaps the short@@ est question presented ever .
Four words : Are human genes pat@@ ent@@ able ?
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words , I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know .
I think you have to say , &apos; Is isolated DNA pat@@ ent@@ able ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ope .
I want the jus@@ tic@@ es to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago . &quot; &quot; Well , I certainly couldn &apos;t argue with that .
The Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t only hear@@ s about one percent of the cases that it recei@@ ves , and it agreed to hear ours .
The day of the oral argument arri@@ ves , and it was really , really exciting — long line of people outside , people had been standing in line since 2 : 30 in the morning to try to get into the cour@@ thou@@ se .
Two breast cancer organizations , Bre@@ ast C@@ anc@@ er Ac@@ tion and FO@@ R@@ C@@ E , had organized a demonstration on the cour@@ thou@@ se steps .
Chris and I sat quie@@ tly in the hall@@ way , moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career .
I was clearly more nervous than he was .
But any remaining panic subsi@@ ded as I walked into the cour@@ t@@ room and looked around at a sea of friendly faces : our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories , the gene@@ tici@@ sts who had taken huge ch@@ un@@ ks of time out of their busy care@@ ers to dedi@@ cate themselves to this fight and represen@@ ta@@ tives from a diverse array of medical , patient advoca@@ cy , environmental and religious organizations , who had sub@@ mitted friend of the court bri@@ e@@ fs in the case .
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Gen@@ ome Project , including the co-@@ discover@@ er of DNA himself , James Wat@@ son , who had sub@@ mitted a brief to the court , where he refer@@ red to gene pat@@ enting as &quot; &quot; lun@@ acy . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contribu@@ tions each had made to make this day a reality spoke vol@@ um@@ es to what was at sta@@ ke .
The argument itself was ri@@ ve@@ ting .
Chris argu@@ ed brilli@@ antly .
But for me , the most thri@@ lling aspect was watching the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t jus@@ tic@@ es gr@@ apple with isolated DNA , through a series of col@@ or@@ ful analo@@ gies and fe@@ i@@ sty ex@@ changes , very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years .
Jus@@ tice K@@ ag@@ an li@@ k@@ ened isol@@ ating DNA to extrac@@ ting a medic@@ inal plant from the Amazon .
Jus@@ tice Rob@@ er@@ ts dist@@ in@@ gui@@ shed it from car@@ ving a baseball bat from a tree .
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments , Jus@@ tice S@@ ot@@ om@@ ay@@ or pro@@ claimed isolated DNA to be &quot; &quot; just nature sitting there . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We felt pretty confident leaving the cour@@ t@@ room that day , but I could never have anticip@@ ated the outcome : nine to zero .
&quot; &quot; A naturally occurring DNA se@@ gment is a product of nature , and not pat@@ ent@@ -@@ e@@ li@@ gible merely because it has been isolated .
And fur@@ ther@@ more , My@@ ri@@ ad did not create anything . &quot; &quot; Within 24 hours of the decision , five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the B@@ R@@ CA genes .
Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than My@@ ri@@ ad &apos;s .
Some promised to provide a more compreh@@ ensive test than the one My@@ ri@@ ad was offering .
But of course the decision goes far beyond My@@ ri@@ ad .
It ends a 25@@ -@@ year practice of allowing pat@@ ents on human genes in the United States .
It clear@@ s a significant barrier to bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal discovery and innovation .
And it helps to ensure that patients like A@@ bi@@ ga@@ il , K@@ athle@@ en and E@@ ile@@ en have access to the tests that they need .
A few weeks after the court issu@@ ed its decision , I received a small package in the mail .
It was from Bob C@@ oo@@ k-@@ De@@ eg@@ an , a professor at Du@@ ke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case .
( Laughter ) We took a big risk in taking this case .
P@@ art of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many tw@@ ists and turns along the way .
A little luck certainly helped , but it was the communities that we bri@@ d@@ ged , the al@@ li@@ ances that we created , that made pigs fly .
Thank you .

Hi . Today , I &apos;m going to take you through glimp@@ ses of about eight of my projects , done in collaboration with Dan@@ ish artist S@@ ore@@ n P@@ ors .
We call ourselves P@@ ors and Ra@@ o , and we live and work in India .
I &apos;d like to begin with my very first object , which I call &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; And it was inspired by my uncle &apos;s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him , almost like I were an extension of his body — to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water , a pack of cigaret@@ tes .
And as I grew up , it became worse and worse , And I started to think of it as a form of control .
But of course , I could never say anything , because the uncle is a resp@@ ected figure in the Indian family .
And the situation that ir@@ ked me and my@@ sti@@ fied me the most was his use of a land@@ line telephone .
He would hold on to the recei@@ ver and expect me to dial a number for him .
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle , I made him &quot; &quot; The Un@@ cle Ph@@ one . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that it requires two people to use it .
It &apos;s exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that &apos;s designed for one person .
But the problem is that , when I left home and went to college , I started missing his comm@@ ands .
And so I made him a golden ty@@ pe@@ writer through which he could disp@@ ense his comm@@ ands to ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es around the world as an email .
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper , roll it into the car@@ ri@@ age , type his email or comm@@ and and pull the paper out .
This device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
So here you can see , we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and conver@@ ts it to digital .
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
And of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritu@@ alism , the way my uncle likes it .
The next work is a s@@ oun@@ d-@@ sensitive install@@ ation that we aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately call &quot; &quot; The P@@ y@@ g@@ mies . &quot; &quot; And we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tri@@ be of very shy , sensitive and sweet creatures .
So how it works is we have these panels , which we have on the wall , and behind them , we have these little creatures which hide .
And as soon as it &apos;s silent , they sort of cre@@ ep out .
And if it &apos;s even more silent , they stretch their nec@@ ks out .
And at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hide back again .
So we had these panels on three walls of a room .
And we had over 500 of these little py@@ g@@ mies hiding behind them .
So this is how it works .
This is a video prototype .
So when it &apos;s quiet , it &apos;s sort of coming out from behind the panels .
And they hear like humans do , or real creatures do .
So they get immune to sounds that sc@@ are them after a@@ while .
And they don &apos;t react to background sounds .
You &apos;ll hear a train in moment that they don &apos;t react to .
( No@@ ise ) But they react to fore@@ ground sounds . You &apos;ll hear that in a second .
( Whi@@ st@@ ling ) So we worked very hard to make them as life@@ like as possible .
So each py@@ g@@ my has its own behavior , psych@@ e , mood sw@@ ings , person@@ alities and so on .
So this is a very early prototype .
Of course , it got much better after that .
And we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite play@@ ful and child@@ like with them .
This is a video install@@ ation called &quot; &quot; The Mis@@ sing Per@@ son . &quot; &quot; And we were quite intrigu@@ ed with playing with the notion of in@@ visibility .
How would it be possible to experience a sense of in@@ visibility ?
So we worked with a company that speci@@ aliz@@ es in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , ren@@ dering them invisible .
So I &apos;m just going to show you a very early prototype .
On the right side you can see my colleague S@@ ore@@ n , who &apos;s actually in the space .
And on the left side , you &apos;ll see the process@@ ed video where the camera has made him invisible .
S@@ ore@@ n en@@ ters the room . P@@ op ! He goes invisible .
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and er@@ asing .
It &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet de@@ alt with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fined pretty soon , later .
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space , and we had one monitor , one on each wall .
And as people walked into the room , they would see themselves in the monitor , except with one difference : one person was constantly invisible wherever they moved in the room .
So this is a work called &quot; &quot; The Sun Sha@@ dow . &quot; &quot; And it was almost like a sheet of paper , like a cu@@ t@@ out of a child@@ like drawing of an oil spill or a sun .
And from the front , this object appeared to be very strong and rob@@ ust , and from the side , it almost seemed very weak .
So people would walking into the room and they &apos;d almost ignore it , thinking it was some cra@@ p lay@@ ing around .
But as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in j@@ er@@ ky fashion .
And it would get exhau@@ sted , and it would collapse every time .
( Laughter ) So this work is a car@@ i@@ ca@@ ture of an up@@ si@@ de-@@ down man .
His head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , that it &apos;s sort of fallen into his h@@ at , and his body &apos;s grown out of him almost like a plant .
Well what he does is he moves around in a very d@@ run@@ ken fashion on his head in a very un@@ predictable and extremely slow movement .
And it &apos;s kind of constra@@ ined by that circle .
Because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wan@@ der about in the space .
And there &apos;s no wires .
So I &apos;ll just show you an instance — so when people enter the room , it activ@@ ates this object .
And it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of pain@@ fully goes up , and then it ga@@ ins momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
And this is an important moment , because we wanted to in@@ still in the vie@@ wer an instinc@@ t to almost go and help , or save the subject .
But it doesn &apos;t really need it , because it , again , sort of man@@ ages to pull itself up .
So this work was a real technical challenge for us , and we worked very hard , like most of our works , over years to get the mechanics right and the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um and the dynamics .
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would t@@ opp@@ le over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t in@@ still that fat@@ alism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
So I &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario — it &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my colleague . He &apos;s let it go .
Now he &apos;s getting nervous , so he &apos;s going to go catch it .
But he doesn &apos;t need to , because it man@@ ages to lift itself up on its own .
So this is a work that we were very intrigu@@ ed with , working with the a@@ es@@ thetic of fu@@ r embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber op@@ tics , which tw@@ ink@@ le like the night sky .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
So we wr@@ apped this around a b@@ lob@@ -like form , which is in the shape of a te@@ d@@ dy bear , which was hanging from the ceiling .
And the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a te@@ d@@ dy bear , which is very comfor@@ ting and intimate .
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a te@@ d@@ dy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space , and as if you were looking out into the tw@@ ink@@ ling night sky .
So this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; Space F@@ ill@@ er . &quot; &quot; Well imagine a small cu@@ be that &apos;s about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room , and as you appro@@ ached it , it tried to inti@@ mi@@ date you by growing into a cu@@ be that &apos;s twice its height and &#91; eight &#93; times its volume .
And so this object is constantly expanding and contrac@@ ting to create a dynamic with people moving around it — almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a secret within its se@@ ams or something .
So we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
But we use it because we &apos;re interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create .
And once a creature pop@@ s into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
Thank you .

So I want to start by offering you a free no@@ -@@ tech life h@@ ack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your pos@@ ture for two minutes .
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little aud@@ it of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
So how many of you are sort of making y@@ ourselves smaller ?
Maybe you &apos;re hun@@ ching , crossing your legs , maybe wr@@ apping your ank@@ les .
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to come back to that in a few minutes , and I &apos;m hoping that if you learn to twe@@ ak this a little bit , it could significantly change the way your life un@@ folds .
So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very awkward win@@ k , or maybe even something like a hand@@ shake .
N@@ arr@@ ator : Here they are arri@@ ving at Number 10 .
This lucky poli@@ ce@@ man gets to shake hands with the President of the United States .
Here comes the Pri@@ me Minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy C@@ u@@ d@@ dy : So a hand@@ shake , or the lack of a hand@@ shake , can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks .
Even the B@@ BC and The New York Times .
So obviously when we think about non@@ verbal behavior , or body language — but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists — it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
So what is your body language communicating to me ?
What &apos;s mine communicating to you ?
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a val@@ id way to look at this .
So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language , or other people &apos;s body language , on jud@@ gments .
And we make swe@@ eping jud@@ gments and inf@@ er@@ ences from body language .
And those jud@@ gments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
For example , N@@ al@@ in@@ i Am@@ b@@ ady , a researcher at Tu@@ fts University , shows that when people watch 3@@ 0-@@ second s@@ ound@@ less cli@@ ps of real physici@@ an-@@ patient interactions , their jud@@ gments of the physician &apos;s nic@@ eness predict whether or not that physician will be su@@ ed .
So it doesn &apos;t have to do so much with whether or not that physician was in@@ compe@@ tent , but do we like that person and how they inter@@ acted ?
Even more dramatic , Ale@@ x To@@ dor@@ o@@ v at Prin@@ ce@@ ton has shown us that jud@@ gments of political candidates &apos; faces in just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Sen@@ ate and gu@@ ber@@ nat@@ orial race outcomes , and even , let &apos;s go digital , emo@@ ti@@ con@@ s used well in online negoti@@ ations can lead you to claim more value from that negoti@@ ation .
If you use them po@@ or@@ ly , bad idea . Right ?
So when we think of non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , we think of how we judge others , how they judge us and what the outcomes are .
We tend to forget , though , the other audience that &apos;s influenced by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , and that &apos;s ourselves .
We are also influenced by our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als , our thoughts and our feelings and our physi@@ ology .
So what non@@ ver@@ b@@ als am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
I became especially interested in non@@ verbal expressions of power and domin@@ ance .
And what are non@@ verbal expressions of power and domin@@ ance ?
Well , this is what they are .
So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
It &apos;s about opening up .
And this is true across the animal kingdom .
It &apos;s not just limited to pri@@ mates .
And humans do the same thing . ( Laughter ) So they do this both when they have power sort of chron@@ ically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are .
This expression , which is known as pride , J@@ ess@@ ica Tr@@ acy has studied .
She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally blind do this when they win at a physical competition .
So when they cross the finish line and they &apos;ve won , it doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;ve never seen anyone do it .
They do this .
So the arms up in the V , the ch@@ in is slightly lifted .
What do we do when we feel power@@ less ?
We do exactly the opposite .
We close up . We w@@ rap ourselves up .
We make ourselves small .
We don &apos;t want to bump into the person next to us .
So again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we comple@@ ment the other &apos;s non@@ ver@@ b@@ als .
So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
We do the opposite of them .
So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
I notice that M@@ B@@ A students really exhi@@ bit the full range of power non@@ ver@@ b@@ als .
So you have people who are like car@@ i@@ ca@@ tures of al@@ p@@ has , really coming into the room , they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts , like they really want to occu@@ py space .
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
They raise their hands like this .
You have other people who are virtually collap@@ sing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
You see it on their faces and their bodies , and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny , and they go like this when they raise their hand .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
Women feel chron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating , and how well they were participating .
And this is really important in the M@@ B@@ A classroom , because participation coun@@ ts for half the grade .
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
You get these equally quali@@ fied women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades , and it seems to be partly attribu@@ table to participation .
So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating .
Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
So my main collabor@@ ator D@@ ana Car@@ ney , who &apos;s at Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , and I really wanted to know , can you fake it till you make it ?
Like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
So we know that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als gover@@ n how other people think and feel about us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question really was , do our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves ?
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
So it goes both ways .
When it comes to power , it also goes both ways .
So when you feel powerful , you &apos;re more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when you pretend to be powerful , you are more likely to actually feel powerful .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
So I &apos;m talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physi@@ ological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that &apos;s hormones . I look at hormones .
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the power@@ less look like ?
So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more confident , more optimistic .
They actually feel they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
They also tend to be able to think more abstr@@ actly .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
There are a lot of differences between powerful and power@@ less people .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ o@@ logically , there also are differences on two key hormones : te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , which is the domin@@ ance hormone , and cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , which is the stress hormone .
So what we find is that high-@@ power al@@ ph@@ a males in pri@@ mate hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ies have high te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one and low cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and powerful and effective leaders also have high te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one and low cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
So what does that mean ? When you think about power , people ten@@ ded to think only about te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , because that was about domin@@ ance .
But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
So do you want the high-@@ power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one , but really stress re@@ active ?
Pro@@ b@@ ably not , right ?
You want the person who &apos;s powerful and as@@ ser@@ tive and dominant , but not very stress re@@ active , the person who &apos;s laid back .
So we know that in pri@@ mate hi@@ er@@ arch@@ ies , if an al@@ ph@@ a needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an al@@ ph@@ a role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual &apos;s te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one has gone up significantly and his cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l has dropped significantly .
So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ ima@@ l level , like this tiny manipul@@ ation , this tiny intervention ?
&quot; &quot; For two minutes , &quot; &quot; you say , &quot; &quot; I want you to stand like this , and it &apos;s going to make you feel more powerful . &quot; &quot; So this is what we did .
We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment , and these people adopted , for two minutes , either high-@@ power poses or low-@@ power poses , and I &apos;m just going to show you five of the poses , although they took on only two .
So here &apos;s one .
A couple more .
This one has been du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; &quot; W@@ on@@ der Woman &quot; &quot; by the media .
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-@@ power poses .
So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
This one is very low-@@ power .
When you &apos;re tou@@ ching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
So this is what happens .
They come in , they sp@@ it into a vial , for two minutes , we say , &quot; &quot; You need to do this or this . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t look at pictures of the poses .
We don &apos;t want to prime them with a concept of power .
We want them to be feeling power .
So two minutes they do this .
We then ask them , &quot; &quot; How powerful do you feel ? &quot; &quot; on a series of ite@@ ms , and then we give them an opportunity to gam@@ ble , and then we take another s@@ ali@@ va sample .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
So this is what we find .
R@@ is@@ k toler@@ ance , which is the gam@@ bling , we find that when you are in the high-@@ power pose condition , 8@@ 6 percent of you will gam@@ ble .
When you &apos;re in the low-@@ power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that &apos;s a wh@@ opping significant difference .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
From their bas@@ eline when they come in , high-@@ power people experience about a 20@@ -@@ percent increase , and low-@@ power people experience about a 10-@@ percent decrease .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
H@@ igh@@ -@@ power people experience about a 25@@ -@@ percent decrease , and the low-@@ power people experience about a 15@@ -@@ percent increase .
So two minutes lead to these hormon@@ al changes that con@@ figure your brain to basically be either as@@ ser@@ tive , confident and comfortable , or really stres@@ s-@@ re@@ active , and feeling sort of shut down .
And we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
So it seems that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
But the next question , of course , is , can power pos@@ ing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
This is in the lab , it &apos;s this little task , it &apos;s just a couple of minutes .
Where can you actually apply this ?
Which we cared about , of course .
And so we think where you want to use this is evalu@@ ative situations , like social threat situations .
Where are you being evalu@@ ated , either by your friends ?
For teenagers , it &apos;s at the lun@@ ch@@ room table .
For some people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting .
It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through , was the job interview .
So we published these findings , and the media are all over it , and they say , Okay , so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview , right ?
( Laughter ) You know , so we were of course horri@@ fied , and said , Oh my God , no , that &apos;s not what we meant at all .
For num@@ erous reasons , no , don &apos;t do that .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
What do you do before you go into a job interview ? You do this .
You &apos;re sitting down . You &apos;re looking at your iPhone — or your Android , not trying to leave anyone out .
You &apos;re looking at your notes , you &apos;re hun@@ ching up , making yourself small , when really what you should be doing maybe is this , like , in the bathroom , right ? Do that . F@@ ind two minutes .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
So we bring people into a lab , and they do either high@@ - or low-@@ power poses again , they go through a very stres@@ s@@ ful job interview .
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
They &apos;re being jud@@ ged also , and the jud@@ ges are trained to give no non@@ verbal feedback , so they look like this .
Imagine this is the person inter@@ viewing you .
So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led .
People hate this .
It &apos;s what M@@ ari@@ ann@@ e La@@ France calls &quot; &quot; standing in social qu@@ ick@@ sand . &quot; &quot; So this really spi@@ kes your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
So this is the job interview we put them through , because we really wanted to see what happened .
We then have these co@@ ders look at these t@@ apes , four of them .
They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
They have no idea who &apos;s been pos@@ ing in what pose , and they end up looking at these sets of t@@ apes , and they say , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , &quot; &quot; all the high-@@ power pos@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to hire these people .
We also evalu@@ ate these people much more posi@@ tively overall . &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s driving it ?
It &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
Because we rate them on all these vari@@ ables related to compe@@ t@@ ence , like , how well-@@ structured is the speech ?
How good is it ? What are their quali@@ fi@@ cations ?
No effect on those things . This is what &apos;s affected .
These kinds of things .
People are bringing their true selves , basically .
They &apos;re bringing themselves .
They bring their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , resi@@ due over them .
So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or medi@@ ating the effect .
So when I tell people about this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our outcomes , they say to me , &quot; &quot; It feels fake . &quot; &quot; Right ?
So I said , fake it till you make it .
It &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impos@@ tor .
I don &apos;t want to get there only to feel like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
And that really reson@@ ated with me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an impos@@ tor and feeling like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
I was thrown from the car .
And I woke up in a head injury reha@@ b ward , and I had been with@@ drawn from college , and I learned that my I@@ Q had dropped by two standard devi@@ ations , which was very traumatic .
I knew my I@@ Q because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gi@@ fted as a child .
So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
Just , you know , there are other things for you to do , but that &apos;s not going to work out for you . &quot; &quot; So I really strugg@@ led with this , and I have to say , having your identity taken from you , your core identity , and for me it was being smart , having that taken from you , there &apos;s nothing that leaves you feeling more power@@ less than that .
So I felt entirely power@@ less .
I worked and worked , and I got lucky , and worked , and got lucky , and worked .
Eventually I graduated from college .
It took me four years longer than my peers , and I convinced someone , my an@@ ge@@ l ad@@ vis@@ or , S@@ us@@ an F@@ is@@ ke , to take me on , and so I ended up at Prin@@ ce@@ ton , and I was like , I am not supposed to be here .
And the night before my fir@@ st-@@ year talk , and the fir@@ st-@@ year talk at Prin@@ ce@@ ton is a 20@@ -@@ minute talk to 20 people .
That &apos;s it .
I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m quit@@ ting . &quot; &quot; She was like , &quot; &quot; You are not quit@@ ting , because I took a gam@@ ble on you , and you &apos;re staying .
You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You &apos;re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do .
You &apos;re just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you &apos;re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out@@ -@@ of-@@ body experience , until you have this moment where you say , &apos; Oh my gos@@ h , I &apos;m doing it .
Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
Five years in gra@@ d school , a few years , you know , I &apos;m at Nor@@ th@@ we@@ ster@@ n , I moved to Harvard , I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m not really thinking about it anymore , but for a long time I had been thinking , &quot; Not supposed to be here . &quot;
So at the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire se@@ me@@ ster , who I had said , &quot; &quot; Look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or else you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; &quot; came into my office . I really didn &apos;t know her at all .
She came in totally defe@@ ated , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to be here . &quot;
And that was the moment for me .
Because two things happened .
One was that I realized , oh my gos@@ h , I don &apos;t feel like that anymore .
I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
And the second was , she is supposed to be here !
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
So I was like , &quot; &quot; Yes , you are ! You are supposed to be here !
And tomorrow you &apos;re going to fake it , you &apos;re going to make yourself powerful , and , you know — ( Applause ) And you &apos;re going to go into the classroom , and you are going to give the best comment ever . &quot; &quot; You know ? And she gave the best comment ever , and people turned around and were like , oh my God , I didn &apos;t even notice her sitting there . ( Laughter ) She comes back to me months later , and I realized that she had not just fa@@ ked it till she made it , she had actually fa@@ ked it till she became it .
So she had changed .
And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
F@@ ake it till you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and intern@@ alize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ in@@ y twe@@ aks can lead to big changes .
So , this is two minutes .
Before you go into the next stres@@ s@@ ful evalu@@ ative situation , for two minutes , try doing this , in the elev@@ ator , in a bathroom st@@ all , at your desk behind closed doors .
That &apos;s what you want to do .
Con@@ figure your brain to cope the best in that situation .
Get your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . Get your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
Le@@ a@@ ve that situation feeling like , I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am .
So I want to ask you first , you know , both to try power pos@@ ing , and also I want to ask you to share the science , because this is simple .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this . ( Laughter ) Give it away . Sh@@ are it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power .
Give it to them because they can do it in private .
They need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
What I &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
I &apos;m not going to talk about &quot; &quot; The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tical En@@ viron@@ ment@@ alist &quot; &quot; — probably that &apos;s also a good choice .
( Laughter ) But I am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
And I must say , before I go on , I should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because I &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
So get out your pen and paper .
B@@ ot@@ tom line is , there is a lot of problems out there in the world .
I &apos;m just going to list some of them .
There are 800 million people star@@ ving .
There &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
Two billion people without sanitation .
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS .
The li@@ sts go on and on .
There &apos;s two billions of people who will be sever@@ ely affected by climate change — so on .
There are many , many problems out there .
In an ideal world , we would solve them all , but we don &apos;t .
We don &apos;t actually solve all problems .
And if we do not , the question I think we need to ask ourselves — and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the economy session — is to say , if we don &apos;t do all things , we really have to start asking ourselves , which ones should we solve first ?
And that &apos;s the question I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we had say , 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world , where should we spend it ?
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world , and I will just briefly read them : climate change , communi@@ cable diseases , conflicts , education , financial inst@@ ability , governance and corruption , mal@@ nutrition and hunger , population migration , sanitation and water , and subsi@@ dies and trade barriers .
We believe that these in many ways en@@ comp@@ ass the biggest problems in the world .
The obvious question would be to ask , what do you think are the biggest things ?
Where should we start on solving these problems ?
But that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
That was actually the problem that was asked in D@@ avo@@ s in January .
But of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
Su@@ rely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have a technology to solve that , right ?
So the point is not to priori@@ tize problems , but the point is to priori@@ tize solutions to problems .
And that would be — of course that gets a little more complicated .
To climate change that would be like K@@ yo@@ to .
To communi@@ cable diseases , it might be health clin@@ ics or mosquito nets .
To conflicts , it would be U.N. &apos; s peace@@ keeping forces , and so on .
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds — and I know this is in a sense an impossible task — write down what you think is probably some of the top pri@@ orities .
And also — and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil — to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
What should be at the bottom of the list ?
Please , just take 30 seconds , perhaps talk to your neighbor , and just figure out what should be the top pri@@ orities and the bottom pri@@ orities of the solutions that we have to the world &apos;s biggest issues .
The amazing part of this process — and of course , I mean , I would love to — I only have 18 minutes , I &apos;ve already given you quite a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of my time , right ?
I &apos;d love to go into , and get you to think about this process , and that &apos;s actually what we did .
And I also strongly encourage you , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll also have these discussions afterwards , to think about , how do we actually priori@@ tize ?
Of course , you have to ask yourself , why on Earth was such a list never done before ?
And one reason is that priori@@ tiz@@ ation is incredibly uncomfortable .
Nobody wants to do this .
Of course , every organization would love to be on the top of such a list .
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list .
And since there are many more not@@ -@@ num@@ ber@@ -@@ one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
We &apos;ve had the U.N. for almost 60 years , yet we &apos;ve never actually made a fundamental list of all the big things that we can do in the world , and said , which of them should we do first ?
So it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not priori@@ ti@@ zing — any decision is a priori@@ tiz@@ ation , so of course we are still priori@@ ti@@ zing , if only imp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly — and that &apos;s unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the priori@@ tiz@@ ation , and went in and talked about it .
So what I &apos;m propos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
There are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
We have not had an idea .
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big men@@ u card , but you have no idea what the price is .
You know , you have a p@@ iz@@ za ; you &apos;ve no idea what the price is .
It could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
It could be a fam@@ il@@ y-@@ size p@@ iz@@ za ; it could be a very individu@@ al-@@ size p@@ iz@@ za , right ?
We &apos;d like to know these things .
And that is what the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus is really trying to do — to try to put prices on these issues .
And so basically , this has been the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus &apos; process .
We got 30 of the world &apos;s best economists , three in each area .
So we have three of world &apos;s top economists write about climate change .
What can we do ? What will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that ?
Li@@ ke@@ wise in communi@@ cable diseases .
Three of the world &apos;s top experts saying , what can we do ?
What would be the price ?
What should we do about it , and what will be the outcome ?
And so on .
Then we had some of the world &apos;s top economists , eight of the world &apos;s top economists , including three Nobel L@@ au@@ re@@ ates , meet in C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen in May 2004 .
We called them the &quot; &quot; dream team . &quot; &quot; The Cambridge University pre@@ f@@ ects decided to call them the Re@@ al Mad@@ rid of economics .
That works very well in Europe , but it doesn &apos;t really work over here .
And what they basically did was come out with a priori@@ tized list .
And then you ask , why economists ?
And of course , I &apos;m very happy you asked that question — ( Laughter ) — because that &apos;s a very good question .
The point is , of course , if you want to know about malaria , you ask a malaria expert .
If you want to know about climate , you ask a cli@@ mat@@ ologist .
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first , you can &apos;t ask either of them , because that &apos;s not what they do .
That is what economists do .
They priori@@ tize .
They make that in some ways disgu@@ sting task of saying , which one should we do first , and which one should we do afterwards ?
So this is the list , and this is the one I &apos;d like to share with you .
Of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , I &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
They basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects — basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
Then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
And of course , it &apos;s the very good projects we should start doing .
I &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
These were the bad projects .
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
This off@@ ends a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things where people will say I shouldn &apos;t come back , either .
And I &apos;d like to talk about that , because that &apos;s really curious .
Why is it it came up ?
And I &apos;ll actually also try to get back to this because it &apos;s probably one of the things that we &apos;ll disagree with on the list that you wrote down .
The reason why they came up with saying that K@@ yo@@ to — or doing something more than K@@ yo@@ to — is a bad deal is simply because it &apos;s very in@@ efficient .
It &apos;s not saying that global warming is not happening .
It &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
What they basically show us , the average of all m@@ ac@@ ro@@ economic models , is that K@@ yo@@ to , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
That &apos;s a sub@@ st@@ anti@@ al amount of money .
That &apos;s two to three times the global development aid that we give the Third World every year .
Yet it would do very little good .
All models show it will post@@ p@@ one warming for about six years in 2@@ 100 .
So the guy in Bang@@ lad@@ esh who gets a floo@@ d in 2@@ 100 can wait until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
Which is a little good , but not very much good .
So the idea here really is to say , well , we &apos;ve spent a lot of money doing a little good .
And just to give you a sense of reference , the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
We could give clean drinking water , sanitation , basic healthcare and education to every single human being on the planet .
So we have to ask ourselves , do we want to spend twice the amount on doing very little good ?
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project .
It &apos;s not to say that if we had all the money in the world , we wouldn &apos;t want to do it .
But it &apos;s to say , when we don &apos;t , it &apos;s just simply not our first pri@@ ority .
The fair projects — notice I &apos;m not going to comment on all these — but communi@@ cable diseases , scale of basic health services — just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
It would do a lot of good , but it &apos;s also very , very cos@@ tly .
Again , what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , a lot of sanitation and water projects came in .
Again , sanitation and water is incredibly important , but it also costs a lot of infrastructure .
So I &apos;d like to show you the top four pri@@ orities which should be at least the first ones that we deal with when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world .
The fourth best problem is malaria — dealing with malaria .
The inci@@ dence of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP every year for affected nations .
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that inci@@ dence down to half .
We could avoid about 5@@ 00,000 people dying , but perhaps more importantly , we could avoid about a &#91; million &#93; people getting infected every year .
We would significantly increase their ability to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with — of course , in the long run , also to deal with global warming .
This third best one was free trade .
Basically , the model showed that if we could get free trade , and especially cut subsi@@ dies in the U.S. and Europe , we could basically en@@ li@@ ven the global economy to an ast@@ ounding number of about 2@@ ,@@ 400 billion dollars a year , half of which would acc@@ ru@@ e to the Third World .
Again , the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty , very radically fast , in about two to five years .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on mal@@ nutrition .
Not just mal@@ nutrition in general , but there &apos;s a very cheap way of dealing with mal@@ nutrition , namely , the lack of mic@@ ron@@ u@@ tri@@ ents .
Basically , about half of the world &apos;s population is l@@ acking in iron , z@@ in@@ c , i@@ od@@ ine and vit@@ amin A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe in@@ road into that problem .
That would be the second best investment that we could do .
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
Basically , if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years , we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what it foc@@ uses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV / AIDS .
One is treatment ; the other one is preven@@ tion .
And again , in an ideal world , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
And treatment is much , much more expensive than preven@@ tion .
So basically , what this foc@@ uses on is saying , we can do a lot more by investing in preven@@ tion .
Basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in preven@@ tion .
So again , what we focus on is preven@@ tion rather than treatment , at first rate .
What this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ orities .
I &apos;d like to have you look at your pri@@ ority list and say , did you get it right ?
Or did you get close to what we came up with here ?
Well , of course , one of the things is climate change again .
I find a lot of people find it very , very unlikely that we should do that .
We should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
But of course , we don &apos;t do all problems .
There are many problems out there in the world .
And what I want to make sure of is , if we actually focus on problems , that we focus on the right ones .
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
And I think , actually — Thomas Sch@@ elling , one of the participants in the dream team , he put it very , very well .
One of things that people forget , is that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the climate change impacts will be , people will be much , much richer .
Even the most pes@@ si@@ mi@@ stic impact scen@@ ari@@ os of the U.N.
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2@@ 100 will be about as rich as we are today .
M@@ uch more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
And of course , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
But the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in Bang@@ lad@@ esh in 2@@ 100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bang@@ lad@@ es@@ hi .
We &apos;re actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy .
And so the real point , of course , is to say , do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little , 100 years from now , a fairly rich Dutch guy ?
Or do we want to help real poor people , right now , in Bang@@ lad@@ esh , who really need the help , and whom we can help very , very che@@ ap@@ ly ?
Or as Sch@@ elling put it , imagine if you were a rich — as you will be — a rich Chinese , a rich Bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an , a rich Con@@ gol@@ ese , in 2@@ 100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; &quot; How odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot; &quot; So I think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our pri@@ orities straight .
Even if it doesn &apos;t ac@@ cord to the typical way we see this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
We have , you know , &quot; &quot; The Day After Tom@@ orrow &quot; &quot; — it looks great , right ?
It &apos;s a good film in the sense that I certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect Em@@ mer@@ ich to cast Bra@@ d P@@ it@@ t in his next movie di@@ gging lat@@ r@@ ines in T@@ anz@@ ania or something . ( Laughter ) It just doesn &apos;t make for as much of a movie .
So in many ways , I think of the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus and the whole discussion of pri@@ orities as a defense for boring problems .
To make sure that we realize it &apos;s not about making us feel good .
It &apos;s not about making things that have the most media attention , but it &apos;s about making places where we can actually do the most good .
The other obj@@ ections , I think , that are important to say , is that I &apos;m somehow — or we are somehow — pos@@ iting a false choice .
Of course , we should do all things , in an ideal world — I would certainly agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
In 19@@ 70 , the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much as we did , right now , than in 19@@ 70 , on the developing world .
Since then our aid has hal@@ ved .
So it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , people are also saying , but what about the Iraq war ?
You know , we spend 100 billion dollars — why don &apos;t we spend that on doing good in the world ?
I &apos;m all for that .
If any one of you guys can talk B@@ ush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
But the point , of course , is still to say , if you get another 100 billion dollars , we still want to spend that in the best possible way , don &apos;t we ?
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back and think about what are the right pri@@ orities .
I should just mention briefly , is this really the right list that we got out ?
You know , when you ask the world &apos;s best economists , you inev@@ it@@ ably end up asking old , white American men .
And they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
The only two requi@@ rements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke English .
The majority of them were , first , from developing countries .
They had all the same material but they could go vast@@ ly outside the sc@@ ope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts .
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar — with mal@@ nutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
There &apos;s been many other semin@@ ars and university students , and different things .
They all come out with very much the same list .
And that gives me great hope , really , in saying that I do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about pri@@ orities , and saying , what is the important thing in the world ?
Of course , in an ideal world , again we &apos;d love to do everything .
But if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
I see the C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen Con@@ sen@@ sus as a process .
We did it in 2004 , and we hope to assemble many more people , getting much better information for 2008 , 2012 .
Ma@@ p out the right path for the world — but also to start thinking about political tri@@ age .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot; &quot; At the end of the day , you can disagree with the discussion of how we actually priori@@ tize these , but we have to be honest and fr@@ ank about saying , if there &apos;s some things we do , there are other things we don &apos;t do .
If we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
So I hope this will help us make better pri@@ orities , and think about how we better work for the world .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
I had just driven home , it was around mid@@ night in the dead of Mon@@ tre@@ al winter , I had been visiting my friend , Je@@ ff , across town , and the ther@@ mom@@ e@@ ter on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 degrees — and don &apos;t bother asking if that &apos;s C@@ el@@ si@@ us or Fa@@ h@@ ren@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two scales meet — it was very cold .
And as I stood on the front por@@ ch fu@@ m@@ bling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them .
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked ti@@ ght .
I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Je@@ ff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my pas@@ sport and my suitcase .
So , desper@@ ate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the bas@@ ement window , clear@@ ed out the shar@@ ds of glass , I cra@@ w@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ board and tap@@ ed it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contrac@@ tor and ask him to fix it .
This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-@@ of-@@ the-@@ night lo@@ ck@@ sm@@ ith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even .
Now , I &apos;m a neuros@@ cienti@@ st by training and I know a little bit about how the brain perfor@@ ms under stress .
It rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l that rais@@ es your heart rate , it mod@@ ul@@ ates ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine levels and it clouds your thinking .
So the next morning , when I woke up on too little sleep , worrying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contrac@@ tor , and the freezing temperatures , and the meetings I had up@@ coming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l in my brain , my thinking was clou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was clou@@ dy because my thinking was clou@@ dy .
( Laughter ) And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport chec@@ k-@@ in counter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pas@@ sport . ( Laughter )
So I rac@@ ed home in the snow and ice , 40 minutes , got my pas@@ sport , rac@@ ed back to the airport , I made it just in time , but they had given away my seat to someone else , so I got stuck in the back of the plane , next to the ba@@ thro@@ oms , in a seat that wouldn &apos;t re@@ cl@@ ine , on an eigh@@ t-@@ hour flight .
Or at least if bad things happen , will mini@@ mize the like@@ li@@ hood of it being a total catastrop@@ he .
I was having dinner with my colleague , Dan@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man , the Nobel Prize winner , and I somewhat embar@@ r@@ asse@@ dly told him about having broken my window , and , you know , forgotten my pas@@ sport , and Dan@@ ny shared with me that he &apos;d been practic@@ ing something called prosp@@ ective h@@ ind@@ sight .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psychologist G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
Wh@@ enever there &apos;s a disaster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
Well , in the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m , Dan@@ ny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to mini@@ mize the damage .
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
Around the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a place for things that are easily lost .
Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our sp@@ ati@@ al memory works .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things — where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London ta@@ xi@@ ca@@ b drivers becomes en@@ lar@@ ged .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls to find their nuts .
And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the ol@@ factory sense of the squ@@ ir@@ re@@ ls , and they could still find their nuts .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
So in the home , desig@@ n@@ ate a spot for your keys — a h@@ ook by the door , maybe a dec@@ or@@ ative bo@@ wl .
For your pas@@ sport , a particular dra@@ wer .
If you desig@@ n@@ ate a spot and you &apos;re sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
What about travel ?
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your pas@@ sport , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
Now these are some rather obvious things .
Remember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
Cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l is toxic , and it causes clou@@ dy thinking .
So part of the practice of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
And there &apos;s perhaps no more stres@@ s@@ ful a situation than when you &apos;re confron@@ ted with a medical decision to make .
And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
But this stands as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medical deci@@ sion-@@ making , and indeed for financial deci@@ sion-@@ making , and social deci@@ sion-@@ making — any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational ass@@ ess@@ ment of the facts .
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
Now , you all know that high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol is associated with an increased risk of cardio@@ vascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
And so you &apos;re thinking having high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doctor says , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol , a stati@@ n . &quot; &quot; And you &apos;ve probably heard of stat@@ ins , you know that they &apos;re among the most widely prescri@@ bed drugs in the world today , you probably even know people who take them .
And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! Give me the stati@@ n . &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a stati@@ stic you should ask for that most doctors don &apos;t like talking about , and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less .
It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or under@@ go a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy stati@@ stic is that ?
The number should be one .
But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
We haven &apos;t figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescri@@ bed stati@@ n , what do you suppose it is ?
How many people have to take it before one person is helped ?
This is according to research by research prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers Jer@@ ome G@@ ro@@ op@@ man and P@@ am@@ ela Har@@ t@@ z@@ band , independ@@ ently confirmed by B@@ lo@@ om@@ ber@@ g@@ .@@ com@@ .
I ran through the numbers myself .
Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lo@@ wering my cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol .
So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
And they include terrible things — de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating muscle and joint pain , ga@@ stro@@ inte@@ st@@ inal dist@@ res@@ s — but now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Five percent , not very likely it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;ll still take the drug . &quot; &quot; But wait a minute .
You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be har@@ med by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the stati@@ n or not .
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not .
Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pulled this number out of the air for shock value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .
For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mo@@ val of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 4@@ 9 .
That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ ger@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
They include imp@@ ot@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ tile dys@@ function , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ tal t@@ ear@@ ing , fe@@ cal in@@ contin@@ ence .
So the idea of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to manufac@@ ture all of this on the spot .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your loved ones .
Remember , our brain under stress rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down .
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
F@@ ac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with a predat@@ or , you don &apos;t need your dig@@ es@@ tive system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your immune system , because if you &apos;re body is exp@@ ending metabo@@ li@@ sm on those things and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s lunch , and then none of those things matter .
Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Dan@@ ny K@@ a@@ h@@ ne@@ man and his colleagues have shown .
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are fla@@ wed .
We all are going to fail now and then .
The idea is to think ahead to what those fail@@ ures might be , to put systems in place that will help mini@@ mize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
Ge@@ tting back to that s@@ now@@ y night in Mon@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my trip , I had my contrac@@ tor inst@@ all a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .
So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a gradu@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there .
Good morning !
Are you awake ?
Anyone ! No one ? All right , no problem .
So I looked at the wa@@ iter and said , &quot; Do you have a men@@ u ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
He looked at me stran@@ gely , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ ear@@ d .
&quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ iter .
He was disgu@@ sted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
Two words made a Leban@@ ese young man judge a girl as being back@@ ward and ignor@@ ant .
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It definitely hur@@ ts !
How did we get here ?
Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they invol@@ unt@@ arily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civi@@ lized .
Despite all that , I tried to understand him .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the workplace , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Research says that ma@@ stery of other languages demands ma@@ stery of the mother ton@@ gue .
Gi@@ br@@ an K@@ hal@@ il Gi@@ br@@ an , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , sm@@ elling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writ@@ ings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Moun@@ t Lebanon .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Ger@@ m@@ ans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civi@@ lized world .
Coun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Tur@@ key , Mal@@ ay@@ sia and others , they carried their language with them as they were clim@@ bing the lad@@ der , protected it like a di@@ am@@ ond .
They kept it close to them .
Because if you get any product from Tur@@ key or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Tur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clu@@ eless consumers , like we are most of the time .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Free@@ dom , sovere@@ ign@@ ty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
L@@ angu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Free@@ dom , sovere@@ ign@@ ty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in va@@ in .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
I have a fr@@ anc@@ oph@@ one friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
I asked her once how things were going .
She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mista@@ k@@ enly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; He list@@ ens to F@@ air@@ u@@ z with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to F@@ air@@ u@@ z . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and st@@ ole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pic@@ k@@ le : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
For@@ get about this head@@ ac@@ he and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you rep@@ ly from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that reflects our dreams , aspi@@ rations and day@@ -to-@@ day life .
In a way that dres@@ ses like us and thinks like we do .
After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
Ph@@ ot@@ os of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
And to whoever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nic@@ er and mat@@ ches the reality better .
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laugh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
C@@ rea@@ tivity in your mother ton@@ gue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
A single novel could make us global again .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , twe@@ ets , who &apos;s twe@@ eting ?
Please , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
Now I will tell you a secret .
A baby first identi@@ fies its father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , hon@@ ey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , hon@@ ey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter No@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; M@@ er@@ c@@ i , Ma@@ man , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was ir@@ rational , il@@ logical , e@@ go@@ cent@@ ric — that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , develop@@ mental science has completely over@@ turned that picture .
So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you just one example of this .
One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
After all , one of the things that &apos;s hard@@ est for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
And maybe the hard@@ est thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testi@@ fy to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
Bab@@ ies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness mono@@ lo@@ gue about pon@@ ies and birth@@ days and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
What we did — Be@@ t@@ ty R@@ ap@@ ach@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and I — was actually to give the babies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ wl of raw bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ wl of deli@@ cious gol@@ d@@ fish cr@@ ac@@ kers .
Now all of the babies , even in Ber@@ k@@ ley , like the cr@@ ac@@ kers and don &apos;t like the raw bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
( Laughter ) But then what Be@@ t@@ ty did was to take a little taste of food from each bo@@ wl .
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
So half the time , she acted as if she liked the cr@@ ac@@ kers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i — just like a baby and any other s@@ ane person .
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and go , &quot; &quot; M@@ m@@ m@@ mm , bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
I ta@@ sted the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i . M@@ m@@ m@@ mm . &quot; &quot; And then she would take a little bit of the cr@@ ac@@ kers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; &quot; E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck , cr@@ ac@@ kers .
I ta@@ sted the cr@@ ac@@ kers . E@@ w@@ w , y@@ uck . &quot; &quot; So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
We did this with 15 and 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers if she liked the cr@@ ac@@ kers , but they would give her the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i if she liked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
On the other hand , 15 mon@@ th-@@ olds would st@@ are at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
But then after they star@@ ed for a long time , they would just give her the cr@@ ac@@ kers , what they thought everybody must like .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
The first one is that these little 18 mon@@ th-@@ old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 mon@@ th-@@ olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 mon@@ th-@@ olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at babies su@@ perf@@ ici@@ ally , they seem pretty useless .
And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mates , but also including other mammals , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like k@@ ang@@ ar@@ oo@@ s and wom@@ bats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
And sort of the pos@@ ter@@ birds for this idea are the birds up there .
On one side is a New Cal@@ ed@@ on@@ ian c@@ row .
And cro@@ ws and other cor@@ vi@@ da@@ e , ra@@ vens , ro@@ o@@ ks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some resp@@ ects .
And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
And ch@@ ickens and duc@@ ks and ge@@ ese and tur@@ keys are basically as dumb as du@@ mps .
So they &apos;re very , very good at p@@ ec@@ king for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
Well it turns out that the babies , the New Cal@@ ed@@ on@@ ian c@@ row babies , are fle@@ d@@ gl@@ ings .
They depend on their mom@@ s to drop worms in their little open mou@@ ths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
Wher@@ eas the ch@@ ickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why the cro@@ ws end up on the cover of Science and the ch@@ ickens end up in the soup pot .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully su@@ ited to doing just one thing very well .
So they seem to be beautifully su@@ ited to p@@ ec@@ king grain in one environment .
Other creatures , like the cro@@ ws , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the cro@@ ws .
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migr@@ ated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
My son is 23 .
( Laughter ) And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still p@@ opping those worms into those little open mou@@ ths .
All right , why would we see this cor@@ relation ?
Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disa@@ d@@ vant@@ age .
And that one big disa@@ d@@ vant@@ age is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpl@@ ess .
So you don &apos;t want to have the ma@@ sto@@ don char@@ ging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A sl@@ ing@@ shot or maybe a spe@@ ar might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
You want to know all that before the ma@@ st@@ od@@ ons actually show up .
And the way the evolu@@ tions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like def@@ ective grow@@ nu@@ ps , we should think about them as being a different develop@@ mental stage of the same species — kind of like ca@@ ter@@ p@@ ill@@ ars and but@@ ter@@ flies — except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant but@@ ter@@ flies who are f@@ lit@@ ting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the ca@@ ter@@ p@@ ill@@ ars who are in@@ ching along our narrow , grow@@ n@@ up , adult path .
If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn — and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for — we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Re@@ ver@@ end Thomas B@@ ay@@ es , who was a stati@@ sti@@ ci@@ an and mathematician in the 18@@ th century .
And essentially what B@@ ay@@ es did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to character@@ ize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what B@@ ay@@ es showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
This is Re@@ ver@@ end B@@ ay@@ es &apos;s not@@ e@@ book .
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with condi@@ tional prob@@ abilities that they &apos;re revi@@ sing to figure out how the world works .
All right , now that might seem like an even t@@ all@@ er order to actually demonstrate .
Because after all , if you ask even grow@@ nu@@ ps about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the B@@ lic@@ ket D@@ et@@ ec@@ tor .
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
Let me mention just one that we did with Tu@@ ma@@ r K@@ us@@ h@@ ner , my student .
If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
Wher@@ eas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
It looks as if the wa@@ ving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But un@@ consciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a condi@@ tional probability measure .
And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
When children do experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything &quot; &quot; or else &quot; &quot; playing . &quot; &quot; And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experim@@ ental research program .
Here &apos;s one from C@@ ri@@ stine Le@@ g@@ are &apos;s lab .
What C@@ ri@@ stine did was use our B@@ lic@@ ket D@@ et@@ ec@@ tors .
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an an@@ om@@ al@@ y .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypothe@@ ses in the space of two minutes .
( Video ) Bo@@ y : How about this ?
Sa@@ me as the other side .
A@@ li@@ son G@@ op@@ ni@@ k : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been fal@@ si@@ fied .
( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : This one ligh@@ ted up , and this one nothing .
A@@ G : Okay , he &apos;s got his experim@@ ental not@@ e@@ book out .
Bo@@ y : What &apos;s making this light up .
( Laughter ) I don &apos;t know .
A@@ G : Every scientist will recognize that expression of des@@ pair .
( Laughter ) Bo@@ y : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
A@@ G : Okay , hypothesis two .
Bo@@ y : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) A@@ G : Now this is his next idea .
He told the experim@@ enter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
Not working either .
Bo@@ y : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
A@@ G : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Bo@@ y : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
A@@ G : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Now that is a particularly — that is a particularly ad@@ or@@ able and artic@@ ulate little boy , but what C@@ ri@@ stine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant but@@ ter@@ flies who can test five hypothe@@ ses in two minutes ?
Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosop@@ hers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
And I think just the opposite is true .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a sp@@ ot@@ light .
So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to becomes extremely bright and vivi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dark .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So what happens when we pay attention is that the pre@@ frontal cortex , the sort of execu@@ tive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shu@@ ts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
So we have a very focused , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ driven kind of attention .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lan@@ ter@@ n of consciousness than a sp@@ ot@@ light of consciousness .
So babies and young children are very bad at nar@@ rowing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re floo@@ ded with these neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ mit@@ ters that are really good at induc@@ ing learning and plas@@ tic@@ ity , and the inhi@@ bit@@ ory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those but@@ ter@@ flies who are designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before — when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contrac@@ ts , it exp@@ ands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , fac@@ ul@@ ty meet@@ ing-@@ atten@@ ding z@@ om@@ bie back home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking down@@ stairs , actually mi@@ mics the effect of those baby neur@@ ot@@ r@@ ans@@ mit@@ ters .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-@@ es@@ pres@@ so@@ s .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you wa@@ king up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning . ( Laughter )
Now it &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grow@@ n@@ up .
We can do things like tie our sho@@ el@@ aces and cross the street by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
But if what we want is to be like those but@@ ter@@ flies , to have open-@@ min@@ de@@ dness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

These are simple objects : clo@@ cks , keys , comb@@ s , glas@@ ses .
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bos@@ nia carried with them on their final journey .
We are all familiar with these m@@ und@@ ane , everyday objects .
The fact that some of the victims carried personal ite@@ ms such as too@@ th@@ paste and a too@@ th@@ brush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to happen to them .
U@@ su@@ ally , they were told that they were going to be ex@@ changed for prisoners of war .
These ite@@ ms have been recovered from num@@ erous mass gra@@ ves across my hom@@ el@@ and , and as we speak , for@@ en@@ s@@ ics are ex@@ hum@@ ing bodies from new@@ ly discovered mass gra@@ ves , 20 years after the war .
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered .
During the four years of conflict that devast@@ ated the Bos@@ ni@@ an nation in the early &apos; 90s , approxim@@ ately 30,000 citizens , mainly civi@@ li@@ ans , went missing , presu@@ med killed , and another 100,000 were killed during combat operations .
Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the hos@@ ti@@ lities , when U.N. safe zones like S@@ re@@ br@@ en@@ ica fell into the hands of the Ser@@ b army .
The international criminal tri@@ b@@ un@@ al delivered a number of sentences for crimes against humanity and genocide .
Gen@@ oci@@ de is a syste@@ matic and deli@@ ber@@ ate destruction of a racial , political , religious or eth@@ n@@ ic group .
As much as genocide is about killing .
It is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
Gen@@ oci@@ de is not only about the killing ; it is about the den@@ ied identity .
There are always trac@@ es — no such thing as a perfect crime .
There are always rem@@ n@@ ants of the peri@@ shed ones that are more dur@@ able than their fragile bodies and our sel@@ ective and f@@ ading memory of them .
These ite@@ ms are recovered from num@@ erous mass gra@@ ves , and the main goal of this collection of the ite@@ ms is a unique process of identifying those who disappeared in the kill@@ ings , the first act of genocide on European soil since the Ho@@ lo@@ ca@@ ust .
Not a single body should remain un@@ discovered or uni@@ d@@ enti@@ fied .
Once recovered , these ite@@ ms that the victims carried with them on their way to execu@@ tion are carefully clean@@ ed , analy@@ zed , catal@@ o@@ gu@@ ed and stored .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of arti@@ facts are packed in white plastic bags just like the ones you see on C@@ S@@ I .
These objects are used as a for@@ en@@ si@@ c tool in visual identi@@ fication of the victims , but they are also used as very valuable for@@ en@@ si@@ c evidence in the ongoing war crimes trials .
Sur@@ vi@@ v@@ ors are occasionally called to try to identify these ite@@ ms physically , but physical brow@@ sing is extremely difficult , an in@@ effective and painful process .
Once the for@@ en@@ s@@ ics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects , they become or@@ ph@@ ans of the narrative .
Many of them get destroyed , believe it or not , or they get simply shel@@ ved , out of sight and out of mind .
I decided a few years ago to photograph every single ex@@ hum@@ ed it@@ em in order to create a visual arch@@ ive that survivors could easily brow@@ se .
I like to move beyond raising awareness .
And in this case , someone may recognize these ite@@ ms or at least their photographs will remain as a permanent , un@@ bi@@ ased and accurate remin@@ der of what happened .
Ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ hy is about empathy , and the fami@@ li@@ arity of these ite@@ ms guarantee empathy .
In this case , I am merely a tool , a for@@ en@@ si@@ c , if you like , and the result is a photography that is as close as possible of being a document .
Once all the missing per@@ sons are identified , only deca@@ ying bodies in their gra@@ ves and these everyday ite@@ ms will remain .
In all their simpli@@ city , these ite@@ ms are the last te@@ sta@@ ment to the identity of the victims , the last permanent remin@@ der that these people ever existed .
Thank you very much .

A few years ago , I felt like I was stuck in a r@@ ut , so I decided to follow in the foot@@ steps of the great American philosopher , M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ lock , and try something new for 30 days .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 3@@ 0-@@ day challenges .
The first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memor@@ able .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 3@@ 0-@@ day challenges .
I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough , you can do anything for 30 days .
By the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
You might be sle@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved , but you &apos;ll finish your novel .
It &apos;s awful .
( Laughter ) But for the rest of my life , if I meet John H@@ od@@ g@@ man at a TED party , I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m a computer scientist . &quot;
No , no , if I want to , I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a no@@ ve@@ list . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So here &apos;s one last thing I &apos;d like to mention .
I learned that when I made small , sustainable changes , things I could keep doing , they were more likely to stick .
In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .

I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ gger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ gger .
Ph@@ ot@@ os like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it re@@ tains a level of re@@ alism .
Or photos like these — both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ taining the level of re@@ alism .
When I say re@@ alism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
Ph@@ ot@@ os where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with comb@@ ining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when comb@@ ining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ rements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was compos@@ ed .
So by mat@@ ching color , contrast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the borders between the different images , adding photograp@@ hic def@@ ects like depth of field , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipul@@ ated .
But this image is actually entirely compos@@ ed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comprom@@ ise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The sho@@ res are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone p@@ it .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dish .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sket@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
And if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .

The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizon@@ tal axis .
After pu@@ ber@@ ty , we fall off the map .
So we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a technique that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
And the distribution of Japanese is totally different , where we see a group of inter@@ medi@@ ate sounds , which is known as the Japanese &quot; &quot; R@@ . &quot; &quot; So babies absor@@ b the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ bound listen@@ ers that we are .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about .
( Laughter ) We had to run a control group to make sure that coming into the laboratory didn &apos;t improve your Mand@@ ar@@ in skills .
But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise .
And another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a te@@ d@@ dy bear on the screen .
What you see here is the audio result — no learning whatsoever — and the video result — no learning whatsoever .
She &apos;s a six@@ -@@ mon@@ ther .
As the baby hear@@ s a word in her language , the aud@@ itory areas light up , and then sub@@ sequ@@ ently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coher@@ ence , getting the brain coordin@@ ated with its different areas , and caus@@ ality , one brain area causing another to activate .
