( Arabic ) I seek refu@@ ge in Al@@ lah from cur@@ sed Sat@@ an . In the Na@@ me of Al@@ lah , the most Gr@@ aci@@ ous , the most M@@ erci@@ ful .
( English ) I was born in a middle class family .
My father was five years old when he lost his father , but by the time I was born , he was already a busin@@ ess@@ man .
But it didn &apos;t make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl : they were going to go to school .
So I guess I was the lucky one .
My mother had 16 pregn@@ anci@@ es .
From 16 pregn@@ anci@@ es , five of us are alive .
You can imagine as a child what I went through .
Day to day , I watched women being carried to a gra@@ ve@@ yard , or watched children going to a gra@@ ve@@ yard .
At that time , when I finished my high school , I really wanted to be a doctor .
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children .
So I comple@@ ted my education , but I wanted to go to university .
Unfortunately , in my country , there wasn &apos;t a dor@@ mit@@ ory for girls , so I was accepted in medical school , but I could not go there .
So as a result , my father sent me to America .
I came to America .
I comple@@ ted my education .
While I was comple@@ ting my education , my country was inv@@ aded by Russia .
And do you know that at the time I was comple@@ ting my education , I didn &apos;t know what was going on with my family or with my country .
There were months , years , I didn &apos;t know about it .
My family was in a refugee camp .
So as soon as I comple@@ ted my education , I brought my family to America .
I wanted them to be safe .
But where was my heart ?
My heart was in Afghanistan .
Day after day , when I listened to the news , when I followed what was going on with my country , my heart was breaking up .
I really wanted to go back to my country , but at the same time I knew I could not go there , because there was no place for me .
I had a good job .
I was a professor at a university .
I earned good money .
I had a good life .
My family was here .
I could live with them .
But I wasn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to go back home .
So I went to the refugee camp .
And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan , there were 7@@ .5 million refugees . 7@@ .5 million refugees .
About 90 percent of them were women and children . Most of the men have been killed or they were in war . And you know , in the refugee camp ,
when I went day@@ -to-@@ day to do a survey , I found things you never could imagine .
I saw a wi@@ dow with five to eight children sitting there and we@@ eping and not knowing what to do .
I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere , no education , no entertainment , no place to even live .
I saw young men that had lost their father and their home , and they are supporting the family as a 10@@ -to-@@ 12@@ -@@ year old boy — being the head of the household , trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children .
So it was a very devastating situation .
My heart was beating for my people , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
At that moment , we talk about momentum .
At that moment , I felt , what can I do for these people ?
How could I help these people ?
I am one individual . What can I do for them ?
But at that moment , I knew that education changed my life .
It transformed me . It gave me status .
It gave me confidence . It gave me a career .
It helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health , and that &apos;s what I went after .
But do you think it was easy ?
No , because at that time , education was ban@@ ned for girls , completely .
And also , by Russia inv@@ ading Afghanistan , people were not tru@@ sting anyone .
It was very hard to come and say , &quot; &quot; I want to do this . &quot; &quot; Who am I ?
Somebody who comes from the United States .
Somebody who got educated here .
Did they trust me ? Of course not .
So I really needed to build the trust in this community .
How am I going to do that ?
I went and surve@@ yed and looked and looked .
I asked .
Finally , I found one man .
He was 80 years old .
He was a mul@@ lah .
I went to his tent in the camp , and I asked him , &quot; I want to make you a teacher . &quot;
And he looked at me , and he said , &quot; &quot; C@@ ra@@ zy woman , crazy woman , how do you think I can be a teacher ? &quot; &quot; And I told him , &quot; &quot; I will make you a teacher . &quot; &quot; Finally , he accepted my offer , and once I started a class in his comp@@ ound , the word spread all over .
In a matter of one year , we had 25 schools set up , 1@@ 5,000 children going to school , and it was amazing .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you .
But of course , we &apos;re doing all our work , we were giving teacher training . We were training women &apos;s rights , human rights , democracy , rule of law . We were giving all kinds of training . And one day , I tell you ,
one day I was in the office in P@@ es@@ ha@@ war , Pakistan .
All of a sudden , I saw my staff running to rooms and lo@@ cking the doors and telling me , &quot; &quot; Ru@@ n away , hide ! &quot; &quot; And you know , as a leader , what do you do ?
You &apos;re scared . You know it &apos;s dangerous .
You know your life is on the line .
But as a leader , you have to hold it together .
You have to hold it together and show strength .
So I said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And these people were pouring into my office .
So I invited them to the office .
They came , and there were nine of them — nine Taliban .
They were the u@@ gli@@ est looking men you can ever see .
( Laughter ) Very mean@@ -@@ looking people , black clothes , black tur@@ ban , and they pour into my office .
And I invited them to have a seat and have tea .
They said no . They are not going to drink tea .
And of course , with the tone of voice they were using , it was very scary , but I was really sha@@ king up .
But also I was strong , holding myself up .
And , of course , by that time , you know how I dress — I dress from head to to@@ e in a black hi@@ ja@@ b .
The only thing you could see , my eyes .
They asked me , &quot; &quot; What are you doing ?
Don &apos;t you know that school is ban@@ ned for girls ?
What are you doing here ? &quot; &quot; And you know , I just looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; What school ? Where is the school ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And they look at my face , and they said , &quot; &quot; You are teaching girls here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; This is a house of somebody .
We have some students coming , and they are all learning K@@ oran , Ho@@ ly B@@ ook .
And you know , K@@ oran says that if you learn the Ho@@ ly B@@ ook , the woman , they can be a good wife , and they can obe@@ y their husband . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I tell you one thing : that &apos;s the way you work with those people , and you know — ( Laughter ) So by that time , they started speaking P@@ ash@@ to .
They talked to each other , and they said , &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s go , leave her alone , she &apos;s OK . &quot; &quot; And you know , this time , I offered them tea again , and they took a si@@ p and they left .
By that time , my staff p@@ ou@@ red into my office .
They were scared to death .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t kill me .
They didn &apos;t know why they didn &apos;t take me away .
But everybody was happy to see me .
Very happy , and I was happy to be alive , of course .
( Laughter ) Of course , I was happy to be alive .
But also , as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban — of course during the Taliban there is another story .
We went underground and we provided education for 80 school@@ girls , 3,000 students underground , and continuously we trained .
With the fall of the Taliban , we went into the country , and we opened school after school .
We opened women &apos;s learning center .
We continuously opened clin@@ ics .
We worked with mothers and children .
We had re@@ productive health training .
We had all kinds of training that you can imagine .
I was very happy . I was deli@@ ghted with the outcome of my work .
And one day , with four tra@@ in@@ ers and one bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard , I was going up north of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l , and all of a sudden , again , I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men .
Ri@@ fl@@ es on their shoul@@ ders , they blo@@ cked the road .
And I told my driver , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; And the driver said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; He asked them . They said , &quot; &quot; We have nothing to do with you . &quot; &quot; They called my name . They said , &quot; &quot; We want her . &quot; &quot; My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard got out , said , &quot; &quot; I can answer you .
What do you want ? &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; They called my name .
And by that time , the women are y@@ elling and screaming inside the car .
I am very sha@@ ken up , and I told myself , this is it .
This time , we all are going to be killed .
There is no doubt in my mind .
But still , the moment comes , and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do .
It &apos;s in your heart .
You believe in your worth , and you can walk on it .
So I just hold myself on the side of the car .
My leg was sha@@ king , and I got outside .
And I asked them , &quot; &quot; What can I do for you ? &quot; &quot; You know what they said to me ?
They said , &quot; &quot; We know who you are .
We know where you are going .
Every day you go up north here and there .
You train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
You build their skills . How about us ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; &quot; And you know , how about us ?
What are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; I looked at them , and I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s OK .
The only thing we can do , what we know , from the time we &apos;re born , we just hold the gun and kill .
That &apos;s all we know . &quot; &quot; And you know what that means .
It &apos;s a tra@@ p to me , of course .
So I walk out of there . They said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll let you go , go . &quot; &quot; And so I walked into the car , I sit in the car , and I told the driver , &quot; &quot; Tur@@ n around and go back to the office . &quot; &quot; At that time , we only were supporting girls .
We only had money for women to train them , to send them to school , and nothing else .
By the time I came to the office , of course my tra@@ in@@ ers were gone .
They ran away home . Nobody stayed there .
My bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ard was the only one there , and my voice was completely gone .
I was sha@@ ken up , and I sat on my table , and I said , &quot; &quot; What am I going to do ? &quot; &quot; How am I going to solve this problem ?
Because we had training going on up north already .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of women were there coming to get training .
So I was sitting there , all of a sudden , at this moment , talking about momentum , we are , at that moment , one of my wonderful don@@ ors called me about a report .
And she asked me , &quot; &quot; Sa@@ k@@ ena ? &quot; &quot; And I answered her .
She said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not you . What &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot; &quot; I tried to cover .
No matter what I tried to do , she didn &apos;t believe me , and she asked me again .
&quot; OK , tell me what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I told her the whole story .
At that time , she said , &quot; &quot; OK , you go next time , and you will help them .
You will help them . &quot; &quot; And when , two days later , I went the same route , and do you know , they were not in here , they were a little back further , the same young men , standing up there and holding the ri@@ f@@ le and pointing to us to stop the car .
So we stopped the car .
I got out . I said , &quot; &quot; OK , let &apos;s go with me . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; On one condition , that whatever I say , you accept it . &quot; &quot; And they said , yes , they do .
So I took them to the mos@@ que , and to make a long story short , I told them I &apos;d give them teachers .
Today , they are the best tra@@ in@@ ers .
They learn English , they learn how to be teachers , they learn computers , and they are my gui@@ des .
Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas , they go with me . They are ahead , and we go .
And they protect us .
And — ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
That tells you that education trans@@ forms people .
When you educate people , they are going to be different , and today all over , we need to work for gender equality .
We cannot only train women but forget about the men , because the men are the real people who are giving women the hard@@ est time .
( Laughter ) So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
So we are continuously giving training to men , and I really believe strongly .
I live in a country that was a beautiful country .
I just want to share this with you .
It was a beautiful country , beautiful , peaceful country .
We were going everywhere .
Women were getting education : lawyer , engineer , teacher , and we were going from house to house .
We never locked our doors .
But you know what happened to my country .
Today , people cannot walk out of their door without security issues .
But we want the same Afghanistan we had before .
And I want to tell you the other side .
Today , the women of Afghanistan are working very , very hard .
They are earning degrees . They are training to be lawyers .
They are training to be doctors , back again .
They are training to be teachers , and they are running businesses .
So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential , and all of this is going to happen .
I want to share this with you , because of love , because of compassion , and because of trust and honesty .
If you have these few things with you , you will ac@@ comp@@ lish .
We have one poet , M@@ aw@@ l@@ ā@@ n@@ ā R@@ ū@@ m@@ ī .
He said that by having compassion and having love , you can con@@ qu@@ er the world .
And I tell you , we could .
And if we could do it in Afghanistan , I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world .
Thank you very , very much .
( Applause ) Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
Ten years ago , I got a phone call that changed my life .
At the time , I was cardio@@ logist at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , speci@@ alizing in car@@ diac imaging techniques .
The call came from a veter@@ in@@ arian at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o .
An elderly female chimpanzee had wo@@ ken up with a facial dro@@ op and the veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were worried that she &apos;d had a stroke .
They asked if I &apos;d come to the zo@@ o and image the animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible car@@ diac cause .
Now , to be clear , North American z@@ oo@@ s are sta@@ ff@@ ed by highly quali@@ fied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ certi@@ fied veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ standing care of their animal patients .
But occasionally , they do reach into the human medical community , particularly for some speci@@ ality consul@@ tation , and I was one of the lucky physici@@ ans who was invited in to help .
I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gor@@ ill@@ a didn &apos;t have a tor@@ n a@@ ort@@ a , evalu@@ ate this ma@@ ca@@ w for a heart mur@@ m@@ ur , make sure that this California sea lion &apos;s par@@ ic@@ ar@@ dium wasn &apos;t infl@@ amed , and in this picture , I &apos;m listening to the heart of a lion after a lif@@ es@@ a@@ ving , collaborative procedure with veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans and physici@@ ans where we dra@@ ined 700 c@@ c &apos;s of fluid from the sa@@ c in which this lion &apos;s heart was contained .
And this procedure , which I have done on many human patients , was identical , with the exception of that pa@@ w and that tail .
Now most of the time , I was working at U@@ C@@ L@@ A Medi@@ cal Center with physici@@ ans , discussing symptoms and diagnos@@ es and treatments for my human patients , but some of the time , I was working at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o with veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , discussing symptoms and diagnos@@ es and treatments for their animal patients .
And occasionally , on the very same day , I went on r@@ ounds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A Medi@@ cal Center and at the Los Angeles Z@@ o@@ o .
And here &apos;s what started coming into very clear focus for me .
P@@ hy@@ s@@ icians and veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients : cong@@ es@@ tive heart failure , brain tumors , le@@ u@@ ke@@ mi@@ a , diabetes , ar@@ thri@@ tis , AL@@ S , breast cancer , even psychiatric syndr@@ omes like depression , anxiety , comp@@ ul@@ sions , eating disorders and self-@@ injury .
Now , I &apos;ve got a conf@@ ession to make .
Even though I studied compar@@ ative physi@@ ology and evolutionary biology as an under@@ gra@@ d — I had even written my senior the@@ sis on Dar@@ win@@ ian theory — learning about the significant over@@ la@@ p between the disorders of animals and humans , it came as a much needed wa@@ ke@@ -up call for me .
So I started wondering , with all of these over@@ l@@ aps , how was it that I had never thought to ask a veter@@ in@@ arian , or con@@ s@@ ult the veter@@ in@@ ary literature , for insights into one of my human patients ?
Why had I never , nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked , ever atten@@ ded a veter@@ in@@ ary conference ?
For that matter , why was any of this a surprise ?
I mean , look , every single physician accep@@ ts some biological connection between animals and humans .
Every medication that we prescri@@ be or that we &apos;ve taken ourselves or we &apos;ve given to our families has first been tested on an animal .
But there &apos;s something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing cong@@ es@@ tive heart failure or diabetes or breast cancer on their own .
Now , maybe some of the surprise comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the non@@ urban .
You know , we hear about these city kids who think that w@@ ool grows on trees or that cheese comes from a plant .
Well , today &apos;s human hospitals , increasingly , are turning into these g@@ le@@ aming cathe@@ dr@@ als of technology .
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans and farms and jun@@ g@@ les .
But I think there &apos;s an even deeper reason .
P@@ hy@@ s@@ icians and scientists , we accept intellec@@ tually that our species , Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , is merely one species , no more unique or special than any other .
But in our hearts , we don &apos;t completely believe that .
I feel it myself when I &apos;m listening to Mo@@ z@@ art or looking at pictures of the Mars R@@ over on my M@@ ac@@ B@@ ook .
I feel that tu@@ g of human excep@@ tion@@ alism , even as I recognize the scienti@@ fically isol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ ior species , apart .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days .
When I see a human patient now , I always ask , what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don &apos;t know ?
And , might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient ?
Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to .
F@@ ear@@ -@@ induc@@ ed heart failure .
Around the year 2000 , human cardio@@ logists &quot; &quot; discovered &quot; &quot; emotionally induc@@ ed heart failure .
It was described in a gam@@ bling father who had lost his life &apos;s savings with a roll of the di@@ ce , in a bri@@ de who &apos;d been left at the al@@ ter .
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , nor was it uni@@ qu@@ ely human .
V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans had been diagnos@@ ing , treating and even preven@@ ting emotionally induc@@ ed symptoms in animals r@@ anging from monkeys to fl@@ am@@ in@@ gos , from to de@@ er to rab@@ bits , since the 1970s .
How many human lives might have been saved if this veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge had been put into the hands of E.@@ R@@ . doc@@ s and cardio@@ logists ?
S@@ el@@ f-@@ injury .
Some human patients harm themselves .
Some pl@@ uck out pat@@ ches of hair , others actually cut themselves .
Some animal patients also harm themselves .
There are st@@ al@@ lions that repe@@ ti@@ tively bite their fl@@ anks until they ble@@ ed .
But veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preven@@ ting self-@@ injury in their self-@@ inj@@ uring animals .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this veter@@ in@@ ary knowledge be put into the hands of psycho@@ therap@@ ists and parents and patients struggling with self-@@ injury ?
P@@ os@@ t@@ par@@ tum depression and post@@ par@@ tum psych@@ osis .
Sometimes , soon after giving birth , some women become depressed , and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psycho@@ tic .
They may ne@@ gl@@ ect their new@@ born , and in some extreme cases , even harm the child .
E@@ qu@@ ine veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans also know that occasionally , a m@@ are , soon after giving birth , will ne@@ gl@@ ect the fo@@ al , ref@@ using to nurse , and in some inst@@ ances , kick the fo@@ al , even to death .
But veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have devi@@ sed an intervention to deal with this fo@@ al rej@@ ection syndrome that involves increasing oxytocin in the m@@ are .
Ox@@ y@@ tocin is the bon@@ ding hormone , and this leads to rene@@ wed interest , on the part of the m@@ are , in her fo@@ al .
Sh@@ ouldn &apos;t this information be put into the hands of o@@ b / gy@@ n &apos;s and family doctors and patients who are struggling with post@@ par@@ tum depression and psych@@ osis ?
Well , despite all of this promise , unfortunately the g@@ ulf between our fields remains large .
To explain it , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to air some dirty la@@ und@@ ry .
Some physici@@ ans can be real s@@ no@@ bs about doctors who are not M@@ .D. &apos; s .
I &apos;m talking about d@@ enti@@ sts and op@@ t@@ ome@@ tri@@ sts and psychologists , but maybe especially animal doctors .
Of course , most physici@@ ans don &apos;t realize that it is harder to get into v@@ et school these days than medical school , and that when we go to medical school , we learn everything there is to know about one species , Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , but veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans need to learn about health and disease in mammals , amp@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans , rep@@ ti@@ les , fish and birds .
So I don &apos;t blame the ve@@ ts for feeling anno@@ yed by my profession &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion and ignorance .
But here &apos;s one from the ve@@ ts : What do you call a veter@@ in@@ arian who can only take care of one species ?
A physician . ( Laughter ) C@@ losing the gap has become a passion for me , and I &apos;m doing this through programs like Darwin on R@@ ounds at U@@ C@@ L@@ A , where we &apos;re bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embed@@ ding them on our medical teams with our inter@@ ns and our residents .
And through Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity confer@@ ences , where we bring medical schools together with veter@@ in@@ ary schools for collabor@@ tive discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients .
At Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity confer@@ ences , participants learn how treating breast cancer in a ti@@ ger can help us better treat breast cancer in a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teacher ; how understanding poly@@ cy@@ stic over@@ ies in a Hol@@ stein cow can help us better take care of a dance instruc@@ tor with painful periods ; and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high-@@ str@@ ung S@@ hel@@ tie can help an anxi@@ ous young child struggling with his first days of school .
In the United States and now inter@@ na@@ tionally , at Z@@ oo@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity confer@@ ences physici@@ ans and veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans check their attitudes and their pre@@ concep@@ tions at the door and come together as colleagues , as peers , as doctors .
After all , we humans are animals , too , and it &apos;s time for us physici@@ ans to embrace our patients &apos; and our own animal nat@@ ures and join veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans in a speci@@ es@@ -@@ sp@@ an@@ ning approach to health .
Because it turns out , some of the best and most human@@ istic medicine is being practic@@ ed by doctors whose patients aren &apos;t human .
And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet live , grow , get sick and heal .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
Isn &apos;t it nice ?
( Laughter ) The key phrase is &quot; &quot; was , &quot; &quot; p@@ he@@ w .
( Applause ) Ha@@ ving brain cancer was really , as you can imagine , sho@@ cking news for me .
I knew nothing about cancer .
In Western cultures , when you have cancer , it &apos;s as if you disappear in a way .
Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data : Your images , your exam@@ s , your lab values , a list of medicines .
You suddenly become a disease on legs .
D@@ oc@@ tors start speaking a language which you don &apos;t understand .
They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images .
People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease , instead of with the human being .
They say , &quot; &quot; What did the doctor say ? &quot; &quot; before even saying , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello . &quot; &quot; And in the mean@@ while , you &apos;re left with questions to which nobody gives an answer .
These are the &quot; &quot; Can I ? &quot; &quot; questions : Can I work while I have cancer ?
Can I study ? Can I make love ? Can I be creative ?
And you wonder , &quot; &quot; What have I done to deserve this ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I change something about my lifestyle ? &quot; &quot; You wonder , &quot; &quot; Can I do something ?
Are there any other options ? &quot; &quot; And , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scen@@ ari@@ os , because they are very professional and dedicated to cur@@ ing you .
But they also are very used to having to deal with patients , so I &apos;d say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is tor@@ ture for you and that you become , literally , a patient — &quot; patient &quot; means &quot; the one who wa@@ its . &quot;
( Laughter ) Things are changing , but class@@ ically , they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition , to get your friends and family engaged , or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to mini@@ mize the risks of what you &apos;re going through .
But instead , you &apos;re forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers .
While I was in the hospital , I asked for a prin@@ te@@ d-@@ out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it .
It was really hard to ob@@ tain , because it &apos;s not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer .
I talked to it and I said , &quot; &quot; Okay , cancer , you &apos;re not all there is to me .
There &apos;s more to me .
A cure , wh@@ ic@@ he@@ ver it is , will have to deal with the whole of me . &quot; &quot; And so , the next day , I left the hospital against medical advice .
I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as dr@@ astic as a surgery .
I &apos;m an artist , I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice .
So my best bet was to get it all out there , get the information out there , and use it so that it could be ac@@ cess@@ ed by anyone .
So I created a website , which is called L@@ a Cur@@ a , on which I put my medical data , online .
I actually had to h@@ ack it and that &apos;s a thing which we can talk about in another speech .
( Laughter ) I chose this word , L@@ a Cur@@ a — L@@ a Cur@@ a in Italian means &quot; &quot; the cure &quot; &quot; — because in many different cultures , the word &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; can mean many different things .
In our Western cultures , it means eradi@@ cating or rever@@ sing a disease , but in different cultures , for example , a culture from Asia , from the M@@ edit@@ er@@ ran@@ e@@ an , from Latin countries , from Africa , it can mean many more things .
Of course , I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare provi@@ ders , but I was also interested in the cure of the artist , of the poet , of the designer , of , who knows , the musicians .
I was interested in the social cure , I was interested in the psychological cure , I was interested in the spiritual cure , I was interested in the emotional cure , I was interested in any form of cure .
And , it worked .
The L@@ a Cur@@ a website went viral .
I received lots of media attention from Italy and from ab@@ road and I quickly received more than 5@@ 00,000 cont@@ acts — emails , social net@@ working — most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer , but more of them were about how to cure myself as a full individual .
For example , many thousands of videos , images , pictures , art perform@@ ances were produced for L@@ a Cur@@ a .
For example , here we see Fr@@ anc@@ es@@ ca Fin@@ i in her performance .
Or , as artist P@@ atri@@ ck L@@ ic@@ h@@ ty has done : He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Th@@ in@@ gi@@ verse .
Now you can have my cancer , too !
( Laughter ) Which is a nice thing , if you think about it , we can share our cancer .
And this was going on — scientists , the traditional medicine experts , several researchers , doctors — all connected with me to give advice .
With all this information and support , I was able to form a team of several neuros@@ ur@@ ge@@ ons , traditional doctors , on@@ co@@ logists , and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving , which is very important .
And together , we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages , according to many cultures .
And the current strategy sp@@ ans the whole world and thousands of years of human history , which is quite remarkable for me .
&#91; Sur@@ gery &#93; The fol@@ low-@@ up MR@@ Is showed , luc@@ ki@@ ly , little to no growth of the cancer .
So I was able to take my time and choose .
I chose the doctor I wanted to work with , I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in , and in the mean@@ while , I was supported by thousands of people , none of whom felt pity for me .
Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well , and this was the most important part of L@@ a Cur@@ a .
What are the outcomes ?
I &apos;m fine , as you can see , pretty fine .
( Applause ) I had excellent news after the surgery — I have — I had a very low-@@ grade gli@@ om@@ a , which is a &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; kind of cancer which doesn &apos;t grow a lot .
I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle .
Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery , which was very intense , a matri@@ x of electro@@ des was im@@ planted in my brain from this side , to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls .
And right before the operation , we were able to discuss the functional map of my brain with the doctor , to understand which risks I was running into and if there were any I wanted to avoid .
Obviously , there were .
&#91; O@@ pen &#93; And this open@@ ness was really the fundamental part of L@@ a Cur@@ a .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of people shared their stories , their experiences .
D@@ oc@@ tors got to talk with people they don &apos;t usually con@@ s@@ ult when they think about cancer .
I &apos;m a self-@@ f@@ ounding , continuous state of translation among many different languages , in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research .
&#91; Soci@@ ety &#93; The most important thing of L@@ a Cur@@ a was to feel like a part of a really engaged and connected society whose well@@ ness really depends on the well@@ ness of all of its components .
This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer .
( Applause ) .
Okay , I have no idea what we &apos;re going to play .
I won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
I didn &apos;t realize there was going to be a little music before .
So I think I &apos;m going to start with what I just heard .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Okay , so first of all , let &apos;s welcome Mr. J@@ am@@ ire Willi@@ ams on the dr@@ ums , ( Applause ) Bur@@ n@@ is@@ s Tra@@ vis on the bas@@ s , ( Applause ) and Mr. Christi@@ an S@@ ands on the piano . ( Applause )
So the b@@ and@@ stand , as we call it , this is an incredible space .
It is really a sacred space .
And one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
You really are alive right here in this moment .
There are so many decisions being made when you walk on the b@@ and@@ stand .
We had no idea what key we were going to play in .
In the middle , we sort of made our way into a song called &quot; &quot; T@@ iti B@@ oom . &quot; &quot; But that could have happened — maybe , maybe not .
Everyone &apos;s listening . We &apos;re respon@@ ding .
You have no time for proj@@ ected ideas .
So the idea of a mistake : From the perspective of a ja@@ zz mus@@ ician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
So the way I perceive a mistake when I &apos;m on the b@@ and@@ stand — first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
Every &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; is an opportunity in ja@@ zz .
So it &apos;s hard to even describe what a funny note would be .
So for example , if I played a color , like we were playing on a pal@@ ette , that sounded like this ...
( Music ) So if Christi@@ an played a note — like play an F@@ . ( Music )
See , these are all right inside of the color pal@@ ette .
If you played an E@@ .
See , these all lie right inside of this general emotional pal@@ ette that we were painting .
If you played an F # though , ( Dis@@ son@@ ance ) to most people &apos;s ears , they would perceive that as a mistake .
So I &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
And we &apos;re going to play on this pal@@ ette .
And at some point , Christi@@ an will introduce this note .
And we won &apos;t react to it .
He &apos;ll introduce it for a second and then I &apos;ll stop , I &apos;ll talk for a second .
We &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this pal@@ ette .
( Music ) So someone could concep@@ tually perceive that as a mistake .
The only way that I would say it was a mistake is in that we didn &apos;t react to it .
It was an opportunity that was missed .
So it &apos;s un@@ predictable . We &apos;ll paint this pal@@ ette again .
He &apos;ll play it . I don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
We &apos;ll all accept his ideas , or not .
( Music ) So you see , he played this note .
I ended up creating a mel@@ ody out of it .
The tex@@ ture changed in the dr@@ ums this time .
It got a little bit more rhyth@@ mic , a little bit more intense in response to how I responded to it .
So there is no mistake .
The only mistake is if I &apos;m not aware , if each individual mus@@ ician is not aware and accep@@ ting enough of his fellow band member to in@@ corporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
So ja@@ zz , this b@@ and@@ stand is absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s a very pu@@ ri@@ fying experience .
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don &apos;t take it for granted .
We know that to be able to come on the b@@ and@@ stand and play music is a bl@@ essing .
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
Well we &apos;re ja@@ zz musicians , so stere@@ ot@@ y@@ pically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
( Laughter ) Anyway , I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
And the other dynamic of it is that we don &apos;t mic@@ roman@@ age in ja@@ zz .
You have some people who do .
But what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities .
If I come up and I dic@@ tate to the band that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way , and I just jump right in ...
ready , just play some time .
One , two , one , two , three , four .
( Music ) It &apos;s kind of cha@@ otic because I &apos;m bul@@ lying my ideas .
I &apos;m telling them , &quot; &quot; You come with me over this way . &quot; &quot; If I really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
This is a science of listening .
It has far more to do with what I can perceive than what it is that I can do .
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity , the first step for me is to be patient , to listen to what &apos;s going on and pull from something that &apos;s going on around me .
When you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
W@@ atch . One , two , a one , two , three , four .
( Music ) T@@ ot@@ ally different experience when I &apos;m pulling ideas .
It &apos;s much more organic . It &apos;s much more nu@@ anced .
It &apos;s not about bul@@ lying my vision or anything like that .
It &apos;s about being here in the moment , accep@@ ting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I was here four years ago , and I remember , at the time , that the talks weren &apos;t put online .
I think they were given to TED@@ sters in a box , a box set of D@@ V@@ D@@ s , which they put on their shel@@ ves , where they are now .
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis .
So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes , frankly .
( Laughter ) So , as I was saying — ( Laughter ) You see , he &apos;s right .
I mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously , and I think if people don &apos;t believe it , they should get out more .
( Laughter ) But I believe there is a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same ur@@ gency .
I believe fundamentally , as many speakers have said during the past few days , that we make very poor use of our tal@@ ents .
Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their tal@@ ents may be , or if they have any to speak of .
He said , &quot; &quot; There are two types of people in this world : those who divide the world into two types and those who do not . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I do . ( Laughter )
If you said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t do this anymore , &quot; &quot; they &apos;d wonder what you &apos;re talking about .
( Applause ) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
The great problem for re@@ form or transformation is the ty@@ ran@@ ny of common sense .
( Laughter ) We sup@@ press it . You know , this is our policy . ( Laughter )
We must dis@@ enth@@ r@@ all ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot; &quot; I love that word , &quot; &quot; dis@@ enth@@ r@@ all . &quot; &quot; You know what it means ?
That there are ideas that all of us are enth@@ r@@ alled to , which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things , the way things are .
Great . Now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you &apos;re wearing your w@@ ri@@ st@@ watch ?
And I say , &quot; &quot; No , no , it tells the date as well . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; It has multiple functions . &quot; ( Laughter )
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enth@@ r@@ alled to in education .
Everybody who &apos;s spoken at TED has told us imp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly , or sometimes exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly , a different story : that life is not linear ; it &apos;s organic .
I said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a fire@@ man . &quot; &quot; I asked , &quot; &quot; How long have you been a fire@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ways . I &apos;ve always been a fire@@ man . &quot;
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
He said I was throwing my life away if that &apos;s all I chose to do with it ; that I should go to college , I should become a professional person , that I had great potential and I was wa@@ sting my talent to do that . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; It was humili@@ ating .
You know , I was thinking about that guy recently , just a few minutes ago when you were speaking , about this teacher , because six months ago , I saved his life . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; &quot; He was in a car w@@ rec@@ k , and I pulled him out , gave him C@@ PR , and I saved his wife &apos;s life as well . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; I think he thinks better of me now . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You know , to me , human communities depend upon a diversity of talent , not a sing@@ ular con@@ ception of ability .
And at the heart of our challenges — ( Applause ) At the heart of the challenge is to recon@@ stitute our sense of ability and of intelligence .
When I arrived in L@@ .A. about nine years ago , I came across a policy statement — very well-@@ inten@@ tioned — which said , &quot; &quot; Colle@@ ge begins in kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten . &quot; &quot; No , it doesn &apos;t .
( Applause ) They &apos;re three .
But as we just heard in this last session , there &apos;s such competition now to get into kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten — to get to the right kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten — that people are being interviewed for it at three .
Kids sitting in front of un@@ impres@@ sed panels , you know , with their re@@ sum@@ es — ( Laughter ) F@@ lic@@ king through and saying , &quot; &quot; What , this is it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) &quot; You &apos;ve been around for 36 months , and this is it ? &quot; ( Laughter )
I worked out recently that I was given a gu@@ it@@ ar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Cl@@ ap@@ ton got his first gu@@ it@@ ar .
And if you &apos;re doing the thing that you love to do , that you &apos;re good at , time takes a different course entirely .
You know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
We have to recognize that human flouri@@ shing is not a mechanical process ; it &apos;s an organic process .
And doing that , I think , is the answer to the future because it &apos;s not about sc@@ aling a new solution ; it &apos;s about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions , but with external support based on a personalized curriculum .
Now in this room , there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business , in multi@@ media , in the Internet .
These technologies , combined with the extraordinary tal@@ ents of teachers , provide an opportunity to revolu@@ tion@@ ize education .
He wrote this to his love , M@@ au@@ d G@@ on@@ ne , and he was be@@ wa@@ iling the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible spe@@ ech@@ es and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .
So most everyone wat@@ ches TV .
We like it . We like some parts of it .
Here in America , people actually love TV .
The average American wat@@ ches TV for almost 5 hours a day .
Okay ?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
But a lot of people don &apos;t love it so much .
They , in fact , ber@@ ate it .
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me .
My mother , growing up , she called it the &quot; &quot; idi@@ ot box . &quot; &quot; But my idea today is not to debate whether there &apos;s such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a con@@ science .
So why I believe that television has a con@@ science is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation — that television is how we actually dis@@ semin@@ ate our entire value system .
So all these things are uni@@ qu@@ ely human , and they all add up to our idea of con@@ science .
Now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad TV .
We &apos;re talking about popular TV .
We &apos;re talking about top@@ -@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over the course of 50 years .
How do these Ni@@ el@@ s@@ en ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective un@@ conscious , but how do these top@@ -@@ 10 Ni@@ el@@ sen@@ -@@ r@@ ated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social con@@ science ?
How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ?
Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic pri@@ mal instinc@@ ts .
You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acqui@@ si@@ tiveness .
As humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these basic animal instinc@@ ts .
We have the capacity to laugh and cry .
We feel a@@ we , we feel pity .
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be enter@@ tained .
We love to watch TV .
This is something that clearly separ@@ ates us from the animal kingdom .
An@@ im@@ als might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
So I had an ambi@@ tion to discover what could be understood from this uni@@ qu@@ ely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
I kind of think of it as this cartoon devi@@ l or an@@ ge@@ l sitting on our shoul@@ ders .
Is television literally functioning as our con@@ science , temp@@ ting us and rewar@@ ding us at the same time ?
So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study .
We went back 50 years to the 195@@ 9 / 19@@ 60 television season .
We surve@@ yed the top@@ -@@ 20 Ni@@ el@@ s@@ en shows every year for 50 years — a thousand shows .
We talked to over 3,000 individuals — almost 3@@ ,@@ 600 — aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally .
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?
Did you feel a sense of moral ambigu@@ ity ?
Did you feel ou@@ tra@@ ge ? Did you laugh ?
What did this mean for you ?
So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample .
But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal .
And on a fac@@ tual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. &apos; s most popular shows are exp@@ or@@ ted around the world .
So I really hope our global audiences can relate .
Two acknowled@@ gments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of con@@ science and the tricks that con@@ science can play on us on a daily basis , I thank le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary rab@@ bi , J@@ ack S@@ ter@@ n .
And for the way in which I &apos;m going to present the data , I want to thank TED community super@@ star H@@ ans Ros@@ ling , who you may have just seen .
Okay , here we go .
So here you see , from 19@@ 60 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study .
Two things we &apos;re going to start with — the inspiration state and the moral ambigu@@ ity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that up@@ lift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity are tele@@ vi@@ sions shows in which I don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
As we start , you see in 19@@ 60 inspiration is holding ste@@ ady .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re watching TV for .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity starts to climb .
Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambigu@@ ity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wan@@ e .
Why ?
The C@@ u@@ ban Mis@@ si@@ le C@@ ris@@ is , J@@ F@@ K is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race ri@@ ots , the Vietnam War , M@@ L@@ K is shot , B@@ ob@@ by Ken@@ ne@@ dy is shot , Wat@@ er@@ gate .
Look what happens .
In 19@@ 70 , inspiration plum@@ me@@ ts .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity takes off .
They cross , but R@@ onald Re@@ ag@@ an , a tele@@ gen@@ ic president , is in office .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
But look , it can &apos;t : AIDS , Iran@@ -@@ Con@@ tr@@ a , the Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger disaster , Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l .
M@@ oral ambigu@@ ity becomes the dominant me@@ me in television from 199@@ 0 for the next 20 years .
Take a look at this .
This chart is going to document a very similar trend .
But in this case , we have comfort — the bubble in red — social comm@@ entary and ir@@ rever@@ ence in blue and green .
Now this time on TV you have &quot; &quot; Bon@@ anz@@ a , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t forget , you have &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smoke , &quot; &quot; you have &quot; &quot; An@@ dy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith , &quot; &quot; you have domestic shows all about comfort .
This is rising . Com@@ for@@ t stays whole .
I@@ r@@ rever@@ ence starts to rise .
Social comm@@ entary is all of a sudden spi@@ king up .
You get to 196@@ 9 , and look what happens .
You have comfort , ir@@ rever@@ ence , and social comm@@ entary , not only batt@@ ling it out in our society , but you literally have two establi@@ shment shows — &quot; &quot; G@@ un@@ smoke &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; G@@ om@@ er P@@ y@@ le &quot; &quot; — in 196@@ 9 are the num@@ ber@@ -@@ tw@@ o@@ - and num@@ ber@@ -@@ three-@@ r@@ ated television shows .
What &apos;s number one ?
The socially ir@@ rever@@ ent hip@@ pi@@ e show , &quot; R@@ ow@@ an and Martin &apos;s Laugh@@ -@@ In . &quot;
They &apos;re all living together , right .
Vi@@ e@@ wers had responded dramatically .
Look at this green spi@@ ke in 196@@ 6 to a be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show .
When you guys hear this industry term , a break@@ out hit , what does that mean ?
It means in the 196@@ 6 television season , The &quot; &quot; S@@ mothers Bro@@ thers &quot; &quot; came out of nowhere .
This was the first show that allowed vie@@ wers to say , &quot; &quot; My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presi@@ dency , through television ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we mean by a break@@ out show .
So then , just like the last chart , look what happens .
In 19@@ 70 , the d@@ am bur@@ sts . The d@@ am bur@@ sts .
Com@@ for@@ t is no longer why we watch television .
Social comm@@ entary and ir@@ rever@@ ence rise throughout the 70s .
Now look at this .
The 70s means who ? Nor@@ man Le@@ ar .
You have &quot; &quot; All in the Fa@@ mi@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ ford and S@@ on , &quot; &quot; and the dominant show — in the top@@ -@@ 10 for the entire 70s — &quot; M@@ A@@ S * H@@ . &quot;
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ran@@ ked most highly for ir@@ rever@@ ence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top@@ -@@ 10 during the Ni@@ x@@ on administration .
Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ?
It can make me feel this ?
It can change us ?
So to this very , very sav@@ vy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disrup@@ tive .
Archi@@ e B@@ un@@ ker was sho@@ ved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
This is a quick chart . Here &apos;s another attribu@@ te : fantas@@ y and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; &quot; makes me feel better . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s mapped against the red dot , un@@ employment , which is a simple Bu@@ rea@@ u of L@@ ab@@ or Department stati@@ stic .
You &apos;ll see that every time fantas@@ y and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spi@@ ke in un@@ employment .
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being un@@ emplo@@ yed ?
No . In the 70s you have the be@@ ll@@ we@@ ther show &quot; &quot; The Bi@@ onic Woman &quot; &quot; that ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ted into the top@@ -@@ 10 in 197@@ 3 , followed by the &quot; &quot; Six Mil@@ li@@ on-@@ D@@ ol@@ lar Man &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Char@@ lie &apos;s An@@ g@@ els . &quot; &quot; Another spi@@ ke in the 1980s — another spi@@ ke in shows about control and power .
What were those shows ?
Gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous and rich .
&quot; D@@ all@@ as , &quot; &quot; F@@ ant@@ as@@ y Island . &quot;
In@@ credi@@ ble mapping of our national psych@@ e with some hard and fast facts : un@@ employment .
So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
Whether or not you &apos;re in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-@@ camera sit@@ com and the rise of reality TV .
Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot .
The 90s — the big bub@@ bles of humor — we &apos;re watching &quot; &quot; Fri@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ as@@ i@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Che@@ ers &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Se@@ inf@@ el@@ d . &quot; &quot; Everything &apos;s good , low un@@ employment .
But look : X marks the spot .
In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor suc@@ cum@@ bs to judgment once and for all .
Why not ?
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Su@@ pre@@ me C@@ our@@ t .
We had the bur@@ sting of the tech bubble .
We had 9 / 11 .
An@@ th@@ ra@@ x becomes part of the social le@@ x@@ icon .
Look what happens when we keep going .
At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
What do people want in their TV then ?
I would have thought reven@@ ge or nos@@ tal@@ gi@@ a .
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart .
No , they want judgment .
I can vote you off the island .
I can keep Sar@@ ah Pal@@ in &apos;s daughter dancing .
I can choose the next American I@@ do@@ l . You &apos;re fi@@ red .
That &apos;s all great , right ?
So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years — what did I start with ? — one basic instinc@@ t remains .
We &apos;re animals , we need our mom@@ s .
There has not been a decade of television without a defini@@ tive , dominant TV mom .
The 1950s : June C@@ le@@ ever in the original comfort show , &quot; &quot; Le@@ a@@ ve it to Be@@ a@@ ver . &quot; &quot; L@@ uc@@ ille B@@ all kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .
M@@ au@@ de Fin@@ d@@ lay , the ep@@ it@@ ome of the ir@@ rever@@ ent 1970s , who tack@@ led abor@@ tion , di@@ vor@@ ce , even men@@ op@@ a@@ use on TV .
The 1980s , our first cou@@ g@@ ar was given to us in the form of Alex@@ is Car@@ r@@ ington .
Mur@@ ph@@ y Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single par@@ enth@@ ood .
This era &apos;s mom , B@@ ree V@@ an de K@@ amp .
Now I don &apos;t know if this is the devi@@ l or the an@@ ge@@ l sitting on our con@@ science , sitting on television &apos;s shoul@@ ders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image .
So to you all , the women of TED@@ Women , the men of TED@@ Women , the global audiences of TED@@ Women , thank you for letting me present my idea about the con@@ science of television .
But let me also thank the incredible cre@@ ators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
They give it life on television , for sure , but it &apos;s you as vie@@ wers , through your collective social consci@@ ences , that give it life , longevity , power or not .
So thanks very much .

In 199@@ 4 , I walked into a prison in Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a , and I met a 12@@ -year-old boy who had been tor@@ tured and was den@@ ied access to coun@@ sel .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12@@ -year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
He was not a political prison@@ er .
He was a 12@@ -year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a , but of the 1@@ 13 developing countries that tor@@ ture , 9@@ 3 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tor@@ tured .
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ gative tool .
We often think of tor@@ ture as being political tor@@ ture or re@@ served for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for political prisoners .
It is for people who are in bro@@ k@@ en@@ -@@ down legal systems , and unfortunately because tor@@ ture is the che@@ ap@@ est form of investi@@ gation — it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to coun@@ sel — it is what happens most of the time .
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ gative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
First is the training , empowerment , and connection of def@@ end@@ ers worldwide .
The second is insur@@ ing that there is syste@@ matic early access to coun@@ sel .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
Could we do something for these 9@@ 3 countries ?
And I founded International Bri@@ dges to Jus@@ tice which has a specific mission of ending tor@@ ture as an investi@@ gative tool and imple@@ men@@ ting due process rights in the 9@@ 3 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in cour@@ tro@@ oms .
My first experiences , though , did come from Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a , and at the time I remember first coming to Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a and there were , in 199@@ 4 , still less than 10 att@@ or@@ neys in the country because the K@@ h@@ mer R@@ ou@@ ge had killed them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequ@@ ently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12@@ -year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; &quot; Women would say , &quot; &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot; &quot; So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
The first group of def@@ end@@ ers came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investi@@ gation ? &quot;
And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; , and she said &quot; &quot; K@@ h@@ re@@ w , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; teacher . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; I have def@@ ended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investi@@ gation , because they all come with conf@@ essions . &quot; &quot; And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the conf@@ essions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
And it took a lot of courage for these def@@ end@@ ers to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in imple@@ men@@ ting these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the jud@@ ges kept saying , &quot; &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot; &quot; But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vege@@ table sel@@ ler , she was sitting outside of a house .
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks st@@ ole whatever the je@@ wel@@ ry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
She was pregnant at the time . She had cigaret@@ te bur@@ ns on her . She &apos;d mi@@ scar@@ ried .
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your tor@@ ture conf@@ ession and you will be released . &quot; &quot; And the def@@ end@@ ers began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a .
But Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
In Bur@@ und@@ i I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12@@ -year-old boy , it was an 8@@ -year-old boy for ste@@ aling a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot; &quot; It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
And she said &quot; &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; &quot; because she was acc@@ used of ste@@ aling two di@@ apers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A judge would let her out . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . E@@ igh@@ ty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot; &quot; So lawyers began to cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
For example , in Cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a , it was that &#91; in@@ audi@@ ble name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot; &quot; Or in Zimbab@@ we , where I remember In@@ no@@ cent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; &quot; I have heard it said &quot; &quot; — because he had heard people m@@ um@@ bling
and gr@@ um@@ bling — &quot; &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot; &quot; And then he said , &quot; &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot; &quot; And with that , he successfully organized 6@@ 8 lawyers who have been syste@@ matically taking the cases .
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were t@@ ort@@ uring everybody all the time . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors and jud@@ ges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to def@@ end@@ ers .
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot; &quot; It had everything in it . L@@ aw@@ yers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
P@@ ros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors were perfectly trained .
But I said to them , &quot; &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the pros@@ ecu@@ tor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot; &quot; And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tor@@ tured . &quot;
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to syste@@ matically implement early access to coun@@ sel , because they are the safe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tured .
And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot; &quot; Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating mirac@@ les because of their commitment .
It &apos;s not only In@@ no@@ cent , who I told you about in Zimbab@@ we , but def@@ end@@ ers all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
We have a program called Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ Ma@@ kers , and we realized there are people that are cou@@ ra@@ geous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
So it &apos;s an online cont@@ est where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of imple@@ men@@ ting justice .
And there are 30 Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ Ma@@ kers throughout the world , from S@@ r@@ i L@@ ank@@ a to S@@ wa@@ z@@ il@@ and to the D@@ R@@ C , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through S@@ MS programs , through paral@@ eg@@ al programs , through whatever they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these Jus@@ ti@@ ce@@ Ma@@ kers , but people we cou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot tor@@ ture people or they will be puni@@ shed .
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very cou@@ ra@@ geous lawyers , and said , &quot; &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is imple@@ mented ?
This is fantastic . &quot; &quot; And he said to me , &quot; &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot; &quot; And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Y@@ outh Com@@ muni@@ st Le@@ ague , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed pos@@ ters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-@@ violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support def@@ end@@ ers .
We need to syste@@ matically implement early access to coun@@ sel .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
And people often say to me , &quot; &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wil@@ dly ide@@ alistic .
Never going to happen . &quot; &quot; And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id .
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poe@@ ms from the def@@ end@@ ers , which they share from each other , is : &quot; &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the sta@@ kes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot; &quot; And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only def@@ end@@ ers , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end tor@@ ture as an investi@@ gative tool .
I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are — and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point — &quot; &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot; &quot; Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vi@@ sh@@ na , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bri@@ dges to Jus@@ tice .
Vi@@ sh@@ na was a 4@@ -year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cam@@ bo@@ dian prison in K@@ and@@ al Pro@@ v@@ ince . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vi@@ sh@@ na was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pin@@ ki@@ e , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 15@@ 6 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corru@@ gated , and he would put his fingers through .
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sun@@ shine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vi@@ sh@@ na . He &apos;s a 4@@ -year-old boy .
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own hero@@ ic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; &quot; Pro@@ b@@ ably I can &apos;t do everything .
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot; &quot; So I thank you for having the prop@@ he@@ tic imagination to imagine the shap@@ ing of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Some people think that there &apos;s a TED Talk formula : &quot; Give a talk on a round , red ru@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Sh@@ are a childhood story . &quot;
&quot; Di@@ vul@@ ge a personal secret . &quot;
&quot; E@@ nd with an inspiring call to action . &quot;
No .
That &apos;s not how to think of a TED Talk .
In fact , if you over@@ use those devices , you &apos;re just going to come across as cli@@ ch@@ é@@ d or emotionally manipul@@ ative .
But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common , and I would like to share that thing with you , because over the past 12 years , I &apos;ve had a r@@ ing@@ side seat , listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers , like these .
I &apos;ve helped them prepare their talks for prime time , and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk .
And even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different , they actually do have one key common ingredi@@ ent .
And it &apos;s this : Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listen@@ ers &apos; minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
Let me show you what I mean .
Here &apos;s Hal@@ ey .
She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly , she &apos;s terrified .
( Video ) P@@ res@@ enter : Hal@@ ey V@@ an D@@ y@@ ck !
( Applause ) Over the course of 18 minutes , 1,@@ 200 people , many of whom have never seen each other before , are finding that their brains are starting to syn@@ c with Hal@@ ey &apos;s brain and with each other .
They &apos;re literally beginning to exhi@@ bit the same bra@@ in-@@ wave patterns .
And I don &apos;t just mean they &apos;re feeling the same emotions .
Let &apos;s take a look inside Hal@@ ey &apos;s brain for a moment .
There are billions of inter@@ connected neurons in an impossible t@@ angle .
But look here , right here — a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea .
And incredibly , this exact pattern is being re@@ created in real time inside the minds of everyone listening .
That &apos;s right ; in just a few minutes , a pattern invol@@ ving millions of neurons is being t@@ el@@ ep@@ or@@ ted into 1,@@ 200 minds , just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .
But wait — what is an idea anyway ?
Well , you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world .
I@@ de@@ as come in all shapes and sizes , from the complex and analy@@ tical to the simple and a@@ es@@ thetic .
Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage .
Sir K@@ en Rob@@ in@@ son — creativity is key to our kids &apos; future .
( Video ) Sir K@@ en Rob@@ in@@ son : My cont@@ en@@ tion is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
Chris Anderson : El@@ ora Har@@ dy — building from b@@ am@@ bo@@ o is beautiful .
( Video ) El@@ ora Har@@ dy : It is growing all around us , it &apos;s strong , it &apos;s eleg@@ ant , it &apos;s earthqu@@ a@@ ke@@ -@@ resistant .
CA : Chi@@ mam@@ anda A@@ di@@ chi@@ e — people are more than a single identity .
( Video ) Chi@@ mam@@ anda A@@ di@@ chi@@ e : The single story creates stere@@ otyp@@ es , and the problem with stere@@ otyp@@ es is not that they are un@@ true , but that they are in@@ complete .
CA : Your mind is tee@@ ming with ideas , and not just randomly .
They &apos;re carefully linked together .
Col@@ l@@ ectively they form an amaz@@ ingly complex structure that is your personal world@@ view .
It &apos;s your brain &apos;s operating system .
It &apos;s how you navigate the world .
And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas .
So , for example , if one little component of your world@@ view is the idea that k@@ it@@ tens are ad@@ or@@ able , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react like this .
But if another component of your world@@ view is the idea that leop@@ ards are dangerous , then when you see this , you &apos;ll react a little bit differently .
So , it &apos;s pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your world@@ view are crucial .
You need them to be as reliable as possible — a guide , to the scary but wonderful real world out there .
Now , different people &apos;s world@@ views can be dramatically different .
For example , how does your world@@ view react when you see this image : ( Video ) D@@ alia Mo@@ ga@@ hed : What do you think when you look at me ?
&quot; &quot; A woman of faith , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an expert , &quot; &quot; maybe even &quot; &quot; a sister &quot; &quot; ?
Or &quot; &quot; op@@ pressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brain@@ washed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terrorist &quot; &quot; ?
CA : Whatever your answer , there are millions of people out there who would react very differently .
If communi@@ cated properly , they &apos;re capable of changing , forever , how someone thinks about the world , and shap@@ ing their actions both now and well into the future .
I@@ de@@ as are the most powerful force shap@@ ing human culture .
So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience , here are four gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines for how you should go about that task : One , limit your talk to just one major idea .
I@@ de@@ as are complex things ; you need to sl@@ ash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea you &apos;re most passionate about , and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
You have to give context , share examples , make it vivi@@ d .
So pick one idea , and make it the through@@ -@@ line running through your entire talk , so that everything you say links back to it in some way .
Two , give your listen@@ ers a reason to care .
Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience , you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
And the main tool to achieve that ?
C@@ uri@@ osity .
S@@ ti@@ r your audience &apos;s curiosity .
U@@ se intrigu@@ ing , pro@@ voca@@ tive questions to identify why something doesn &apos;t make sense and needs explaining .
If you can reveal a dis@@ connection in someone &apos;s world@@ view , they &apos;ll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
And once you &apos;ve spar@@ ked that desire , it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
Three , build your idea , piece by piece , out of concepts that your audience already understands .
You use the power of language to wea@@ ve together concepts that already exist in your listen@@ ers &apos; minds — but not your language , their language .
You start where they are .
The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely un@@ familiar to their audiences .
Now , metaph@@ ors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together , because they reveal the des@@ ired shape of the pattern , based on an idea that the listen@@ er already understands .
For example , when Jen@@ ni@@ fer K@@ a@@ h@@ n wanted to explain the incredible new bi@@ otechnology called CRISPR , she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s as if , for the first time , you had a word process@@ or to ed@@ it DNA .
CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily . &quot; &quot; Now , a vivi@@ d explanation like that deli@@ vers a satis@@ fying a@@ ha moment as it sn@@ aps into place in our minds .
It &apos;s important , therefore , to test your talk on trusted friends , and find out which parts they get confused by .
Four , here &apos;s the final tip : Make your idea worth sharing .
By that I mean , ask yourself the question : &quot; Who does this idea benefit ? &quot;
And I need you to be honest with the answer .
If the idea only serves you or your organization , then , I &apos;m sorry to say , it &apos;s probably not worth sharing .
The audience will see right through you .
But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brigh@@ ten up someone else &apos;s day or change someone else &apos;s perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently , then you have the core ingredi@@ ent to a truly great talk , one that can be a gift to them and to all of us .
We re@@ tain just 25 percent of what we hear .
When I married my wife , I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time .
Secondly , the world is now so no@@ isy , ( No@@ ise ) with this ca@@ cop@@ hon@@ y going on visually and aud@@ it@@ ori@@ ly , it &apos;s just hard to listen ; it &apos;s ti@@ ring to listen .
And the art of conversation is being replaced — dang@@ er@@ ously , I think — by personal broad@@ casting .
A world where we don &apos;t listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed .
Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to re@@ set your ears and to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate , so that you can hear the quiet again .
It &apos;s about enjoying m@@ und@@ ane sounds .
This , for example , is my tum@@ ble dr@@ yer .
So , m@@ und@@ ane sounds can be really interesting — if you pay attention .
Now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is O@@ ak Street , that &apos;s El@@ m Street .
This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
Stre@@ ets have names ; blocks are just the un@@ named spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disap@@ pointed .
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lock 17 and this is B@@ lock 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
B@@ lo@@ cks have names .
Just look at Google M@@ aps here . There &apos;s B@@ lock 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the un@@ named spaces in between the blocks .
And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is Di@@ stri@@ ct E@@ ight .
There &apos;s B@@ lock 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
So , you can hear it not just in the phr@@ asing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
