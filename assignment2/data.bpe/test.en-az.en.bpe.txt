Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Hu@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — we can just ski@@ p — I &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
Sol@@ ar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
Sometimes we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to come back to that in a few minutes , and I &apos;m hoping that if you learn to twe@@ ak this a little bit , it could significantly change the way your life un@@ folds .
So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a con@@ temp@@ tu@@ ous gl@@ ance , or maybe a very awkward w@@ ink , or maybe even something like a hand@@ shake .
Narrator : Here they are arri@@ ving at Number 10 .
This lucky poli@@ ce@@ man gets to shake hands with the President of the United States .
Here comes the Pri@@ me Minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) A@@ my Cu@@ d@@ dy : So a hand@@ shake , or the lack of a hand@@ shake , can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks .
We close up . We w@@ rap ourselves up .
We make ourselves small .
We don &apos;t want to bu@@ mp into the person next to us .
So again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power .
So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we comple@@ ment the other &apos;s non@@ ver@@ b@@ als .
So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
We do the opposite of them .
So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ?
I notice that M@@ BA students really exhi@@ bit the full range of power non@@ ver@@ b@@ als .
So you have people who are like car@@ ica@@ tures of al@@ p@@ has , really coming into the room , they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts , like they really want to occu@@ py space .
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
They raise their hands like this .
You have other people who are virtually collap@@ sing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
You see it on their faces and their bodies , and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny , and they go like this when they raise their hand .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
Women feel chron@@ ically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising .
But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were particip@@ ating , and how well they were particip@@ ating .
And this is really important in the M@@ BA classroom , because participation coun@@ ts for half the grade .
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
You get these equally quali@@ fied women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades , and it seems to be partly attribu@@ table to participation .
So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re particip@@ ating .
Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
So my main collabor@@ ator D@@ ana Car@@ ney , who &apos;s at Ber@@ kel@@ ey , and I really wanted to know , can you fake it till you make it ?
Like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
So we know that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als gover@@ n how other people think and feel about us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question really was , do our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves ?
So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
So it goes both ways .
When it comes to power , it also goes both ways .
So when you feel powerful , you &apos;re more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when you pretend to be powerful , you are more likely to actually feel powerful .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
So I &apos;m talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physi@@ ological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that &apos;s hor@@ mon@@ es . I look at hor@@ mon@@ es .
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the power@@ less look like ?
So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more as@@ ser@@ tive and more confident , more optimistic .
They come in , they sp@@ it into a vial , for two minutes , we say , &quot; &quot; You need to do this or this . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t look at pictures of the poses .
We then ask them , &quot; &quot; How powerful do you feel ? &quot; &quot; on a series of items , and then we give them an opportunity to gam@@ ble , and then we take another s@@ ali@@ va sample .
R@@ is@@ k toler@@ ance , which is the gam@@ bling , we find that when you are in the high-@@ power pose condition , 8@@ 6 percent of you will gam@@ ble .
When you &apos;re in the low-@@ power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that &apos;s a wh@@ opping significant difference .
Here &apos;s what we find on te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one .
From their bas@@ eline when they come in , high-@@ power people experience about a 20-@@ percent increase , and low-@@ power people experience about a 10-@@ percent decrease .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Here &apos;s what you get on cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
High@@ -@@ power people experience about a 25@@ -@@ percent decrease , and the low-@@ power people experience about a 15@@ -@@ percent increase .
So two minutes lead to these hor@@ mon@@ al changes that con@@ figure your brain to basically be either as@@ ser@@ tive , confident and comfortable , or really st@@ res@@ s-@@ re@@ active , and feeling sort of shut down .
And we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
So it seems that our non@@ ver@@ b@@ als do gover@@ n how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
But the next question , of course , is , can power pos@@ ing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
This is in the lab , it &apos;s this little task , it &apos;s just a couple of minutes .
Where can you actually apply this ?
Which we cared about , of course .
And so we think where you want to use this is evalu@@ ative situations , like social threat situations .
Where are you being evalu@@ ated , either by your friends ?
For teenagers , it &apos;s at the lun@@ ch@@ room table .
For some people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting .
It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through , was the job interview .
So we published these fin@@ dings , and the media are all over it , and they say , Okay , so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview , right ?
( Laughter ) You know , so we were of course horri@@ fied , and said , Oh my God , no , that &apos;s not what we meant at all .
For numer@@ ous reasons , no , don &apos;t do that .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself .
What do you do before you go into a job interview ? You do this .
You &apos;re sitting down . You &apos;re looking at your iPhone — or your An@@ dro@@ id , not trying to leave anyone out .
You &apos;re looking at your notes , you &apos;re hun@@ ching up , making yourself small , when really what you should be doing maybe is this , like , in the bathroom , right ? Do that . F@@ ind two minutes .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
So we bring people into a lab , and they do either high@@ - or low-@@ power poses again , they go through a very st@@ res@@ s@@ ful job interview .
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
They &apos;re being jud@@ ged also , and the jud@@ ges are trained to give no non@@ ver@@ bal feedback , so they look like this .
So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being h@@ ec@@ k@@ led .
People hate this .
It &apos;s what M@@ ari@@ ann@@ e La@@ France calls &quot; &quot; standing in social quick@@ sand . &quot; &quot; So this really spi@@ kes your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l .
So this is the job interview we put them through , because we really wanted to see what happened .
We then have these co@@ ders look at these t@@ apes , four of them .
They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
They have no idea who &apos;s been pos@@ ing in what pose , and they end up looking at these sets of t@@ apes , and they say , &quot; &quot; We want to hire these people , &quot; &quot; all the high-@@ power pos@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to hire these people .
We also evalu@@ ate these people much more posi@@ tively overall . &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s driving it ?
It &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
Because we rate them on all these vari@@ ables related to compe@@ t@@ ence , like , how well-@@ struc@@ tured is the speech ?
How good is it ? What are their quali@@ fi@@ cations ?
No effect on those things . This is what &apos;s affected .
These kinds of things .
People are bringing their true selves , basically .
They &apos;re bringing themselves .
They bring their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , resi@@ due over them .
So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or medi@@ ating the effect .
So when I tell people about this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our outcomes , they say to me , &quot; &quot; It feels fake . &quot; &quot; Right ?
So I said , fake it till you make it .
It &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fra@@ u@@ d .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impos@@ tor .
I don &apos;t want to get there only to feel like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
And that really reson@@ ated with me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an impos@@ tor and feeling like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
I was thrown from the car .
And I woke up in a head injury reha@@ b ward , and I had been with@@ drawn from college , and I learned that my I@@ Q had dropped by two standard devi@@ ations , which was very trau@@ matic .
I knew my I@@ Q because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gi@@ fted as a child .
So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
Just , you know , there are other things for you to do , but that &apos;s not going to work out for you . &quot; &quot; So I really struggl@@ ed with this , and I have to say , having your identity taken from you , your core identity , and for me it was being smart , having that taken from you , there &apos;s nothing that leaves you feeling more power@@ less than that .
So I felt entirely power@@ less .
I worked and worked , and I got lucky , and worked , and got lucky , and worked .
E@@ ven@@ tually I graduated from college .
It took me four years longer than my peers , and I convinced someone , my an@@ gel ad@@ vis@@ or , S@@ us@@ an F@@ is@@ ke , to take me on , and so I ended up at P@@ rin@@ ce@@ ton , and I was like , I am not supposed to be here .
I am an impos@@ tor .
And the night before my first-@@ year talk , and the first-@@ year talk at P@@ rin@@ ce@@ ton is a 20-@@ minute talk to 20 people .
That &apos;s it .
I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m quit@@ ting . &quot; &quot; She was like , &quot; &quot; You are not quit@@ ting , because I took a gam@@ ble on you , and you &apos;re staying .
You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You are going to fake it .
You &apos;re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do .
You &apos;re just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you &apos;re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out@@ -of-@@ body experience , until you have this moment where you say , &apos; Oh my gos@@ h , I &apos;m doing it .
Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did .
Five years in gra@@ d school , a few years , you know , I &apos;m at Nor@@ th@@ we@@ stern , I moved to Harvard , I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m not really thinking about it anymore , but for a long time I had been thinking , &quot; Not supposed to be here . &quot;
So at the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire se@@ me@@ ster , who I had said , &quot; &quot; Look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or else you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; &quot; came into my office . I really didn &apos;t know her at all .
She came in totally defe@@ ated , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to be here . &quot;
And that was the moment for me .
Because two things happened .
One was that I realized , oh my gos@@ h , I don &apos;t feel like that anymore .
I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
And the second was , she is supposed to be here !
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
So I was like , &quot; &quot; Yes , you are ! You are supposed to be here !
And tomorrow you &apos;re going to fake it , you &apos;re going to make yourself powerful , and , you know — ( Applause ) And you &apos;re going to go into the classroom , and you are going to give the best comment ever . &quot; &quot; You know ? And she gave the best comment ever , and people turned around and were like , oh my God , I didn &apos;t even notice her sitting there . ( Laughter ) She comes back to me months later , and I realized that she had not just fa@@ ked it till she made it , she had actually fa@@ ked it till she became it .
So she had changed .
And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
Fa@@ ke it till you become it .
Do it enough until you actually become it and intern@@ alize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
T@@ iny twe@@ aks can lead to big changes .
So , this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
Before you go into the next st@@ res@@ s@@ ful evalu@@ ative situation , for two minutes , try doing this , in the elev@@ ator , in a bathroom st@@ all , at your desk behind closed doors .
That &apos;s what you want to do .
Con@@ figure your brain to cope the best in that situation .
Get your te@@ st@@ os@@ ter@@ one up . Get your cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l down .
Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
Le@@ a@@ ve that situation feeling like , I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am .
So I want to ask you first , you know , both to try power pos@@ ing , and also I want to ask you to share the science , because this is simple .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this . ( Laughter ) Give it away . Sh@@ are it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power .
Give it to them because they can do it in private .
They need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Our world has many super@@ heroes .
But they have the worst of all super@@ powers : in@@ vi@@ sibility .
For example , the cata@@ do@@ res , workers who collect recycl@@ able materials for a living .
C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res emerged from social inequality , un@@ employment , and the abundance of solid waste from the def@@ ici@@ ency of the waste collection system .
C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res provide a heavy , honest and essential work that benefits the entire population . But they are not acknowled@@ ged for it .
Here in Brazil , they collect 90 percent of all the waste that &apos;s actually recycl@@ ed .
Most of the cata@@ do@@ res work in@@ depend@@ ently , picking waste from the streets and selling to j@@ unk yards at very low prices .
Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are car@@ ts built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil , much like gra@@ ff@@ iti and street art .
And this is how I first met these mar@@ gin@@ alized super@@ heroes .
I am a gra@@ ff@@ iti artist and activist and my art is social , environmental and political in nature .
In 2007 , I took my work beyond walls and onto the car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , as a new urban support for my message .
But at this time , giving voice to the cata@@ do@@ res .
By adding art and humor to the cause , it became more appe@@ aling , which helped call attention to the cata@@ do@@ res and improve their self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em .
And also , they are famous now on the streets , on mass media and social .
So , the thing is , I pl@@ un@@ ged into this universe and have not stopped working since .
I have painted over 200 car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as in many cities and have been invited to do exhibi@@ tions and trips worldwide .
And then I realized that cata@@ do@@ res , in their in@@ vi@@ sibility , are not excl@@ usive to Brazil .
I met them in Argentina , Chile , Bo@@ li@@ via , South Africa , Turkey and even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan .
And this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
And then , I created a collaborative movement called P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a — ( Laughter ) — which is a large crow@@ d@@ funded event .
Thank you .
( Applause ) .
So P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large crow@@ d@@ funded event to help cata@@ do@@ res and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
C@@ at@@ a@@ do@@ res are assi@@ sted by well-being professionals and healthcare , like physici@@ ans , denti@@ sts , po@@ di@@ atri@@ sts , hair sty@@ lists , mas@@ s@@ age therap@@ ists and much more .
But also , they also receive safety shir@@ ts , glo@@ ves , rain@@ co@@ ats and eye@@ glasses to see in high-@@ definition the city , while their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as are ren@@ ov@@ ated by our incredible volunteers .
And then they receive safety items , too : refl@@ ective t@@ apes , hor@@ ns and mir@@ rors .
Then , finally , painted by a street artist and become part of part of this huge , amazing mobile art exhibition .
P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a took to the streets of S@@ ã@@ o Pa@@ ul@@ o , Rio de Jan@@ e@@ ir@@ o and C@@ uri@@ ti@@ ba .
But to meet the demand in other cities , including outside of Brazil , we have created P@@ imp@@ x , which is inspired by TED@@ x , and it &apos;s a simpli@@ fied , do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself , crow@@ d@@ funded e@@ di@@ tion of P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a .
So now everybody can join .
In two years , over 1@@ 70 cata@@ do@@ res , 800 volunteers and 200 street artists and more than 1,000 don@@ ors have been involved in the P@@ im@@ p My Car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a movement , whose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school .
So cata@@ do@@ res are leaving in@@ vi@@ sibility behind and becoming increasingly respec@@ ted and valu@@ ed .
Because of their p@@ imp@@ ed car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as , they are able to fight back to pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , increase their income and their interaction with society .
So now , I &apos;d like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowled@@ ging the cata@@ do@@ res and other invisible super@@ heroes from your city .
T@@ ry to see the world as one , without boundaries or fron@@ ti@@ ers .
Be@@ li@@ eve it or not , there are over 20 million cata@@ do@@ res worldwide .
So next time you see one , recognize them as a vital part of our society .
Mu@@ i@@ to ob@@ ri@@ ga@@ do , thank you .

On November 5@@ th , 1990 , a man named E@@ l-@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a hotel in Manhattan and ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ated R@@ ab@@ bi Me@@ ir Ka@@ han@@ e , the leader of the Jewish De@@ f@@ ense Le@@ ague .
N@@ os@@ air was initially found not guilty of the mur@@ der , but while serving time on less@@ er char@@ ges , he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City land@@ marks , including tun@@ nels , sy@@ na@@ go@@ gu@@ es and the United Nations head@@ quarters .
Th@@ ank@@ fully , those plans were fo@@ iled by an FBI in@@ form@@ ant .
S@@ adly , the 199@@ 3 bom@@ bing of the World Tra@@ de Center was not .
N@@ os@@ air would eventually be convic@@ ted for his invol@@ vement in the plot .
E@@ l-@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
I was born in Pit@@ ts@@ burgh , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania in 198@@ 3 to him , an Egypti@@ an engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Muslims , get to see .
It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small percentage of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
A few months pri@@ or to his ar@@ rest , he sat me down and explained that for the past few week@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice .
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
We arrived at Cal@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ oting R@@ an@@ ge , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being watched by the FBI .
When it was my turn to shoot , my father helped me hold the rif@@ le to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off .
That day , the last bul@@ let I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into fl@@ ames .
My uncle turned to the other men , and in Arabic said , &quot; &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot; &quot; Like father , like son .
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
Those men would eventually be convic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a van filled with 1,@@ 500 pounds of explos@@ i@@ ves into the sub-@@ level parking lot of the World Tra@@ de Center &apos;s North To@@ wer , causing an explosion that killed six people and inju@@ red over 1,000 others .
These were the men I looked up to .
These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means uncle .
By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
Being the perpe@@ tual new face in class , I was frequ@@ ently the target of bul@@ lies .
I kept my identity a secret from my class@@ mates to avoid being targe@@ ted , but as it turns out , being the quiet , ch@@ u@@ b@@ by new kid in class was more than enough am@@ muni@@ tion .
So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
For those reasons , my social skills were l@@ acking , to say the least , and growing up in a bi@@ got@@ ed household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world .
I &apos;d been raised to judge people based on arbit@@ r@@ ary measurements , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presi@@ dential elections .
Through a college pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the National Y@@ outh Con@@ ven@@ tion in Phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a .
My particular group &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been the victim of bul@@ lying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
The members of our group came from many different walks of life .
One day toward the end of the conven@@ tion , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ ended was Jewish .
Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural anim@@ osity between the two of us .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and frankly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insur@@ moun@@ table .
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Bus@@ ch G@@ ard@@ ens , an am@@ us@@ ement park .
There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of fai@@ ths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that hom@@ os@@ ex@@ uality was a s@@ in , and by extension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay perfor@@ mers at a show there , and soon found that many were the kin@@ dest , least jud@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met .
Being bul@@ lied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very un@@ naturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotyp@@ es I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with being jud@@ ged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
Then there was &quot; &quot; The D@@ aily S@@ how . &quot; &quot; On a ni@@ ghtly basis , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t forced me to be intellec@@ tually honest with myself about my own bi@@ got@@ ry and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual ori@@ entation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desper@@ ate need of one .
In@@ spi@@ ration can often come from an unexpected place , and the fact that a Jewish come@@ dian had done more to posi@@ tively influence my world@@ view than my own extre@@ mi@@ st father is not lost on me .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my world@@ view was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live .
She looked at me with the wear@@ y eyes of someone who had experienced enough do@@ g@@ ma@@ tism to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m tired of h@@ ating people . &quot;
In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hat@@ red inside of you .
Z@@ ak E@@ bra@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is comp@@ elled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been sub@@ jected to this violent , int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ideology , that I did not become f@@ an@@ a@@ tici@@ zed .
Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bi@@ got@@ ry .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess acts and con@@ dem@@ n my father &apos;s actions .
And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inher@@ ent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
I am not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you , everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you all . ( Applause ) Thanks a lot . ( Applause )
Good morning !
Are you a@@ wake ?
They took my name tag , but I wanted to ask you , did anyone here write their name on the tag in Arabic ?
Any@@ one ! No one ? All right , no problem .
Once upon a time , not long ago , I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend , or@@ dering food .
So I looked at the wa@@ iter and said , &quot; Do you have a men@@ u ( Arabic ) ? &quot;
He looked at me stran@@ gely , thinking that he mi@@ sh@@ ear@@ d .
He said , &quot; &quot; Sorry ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; The men@@ u ( Arabic ) , please . &quot; &quot; He repli@@ ed , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t you know what they call it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation correct ?
&quot; &quot; Come , come , take care of this one ! &quot; &quot; said the wa@@ iter .
He was disgu@@ sted when talking to me , as if he was saying to himself , &quot; If this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her ! &quot;
What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; men@@ u &quot; &quot; in Arabic ?
Two words made a Le@@ ban@@ ese young man judge a girl as being back@@ ward and ignor@@ ant .
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , I started thinking .
It made me mad .
It definitely hur@@ ts !
I &apos;m den@@ ied the right to speak my own language in my own country ?
Where could this happen ?
How did we get here ?
Well , while we are here , there are many people like me , who would reach a stage in their lives , where they invol@@ un@@ t@@ arily give up everything that has happened to them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and civi@@ lized .
Should I forget all my culture , thoughts , intell@@ ect and all my memories ?
Chil@@ d@@ hood stories might be the best memories we have of the war !
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to con@@ form ?
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the logic in that ?
D@@ esp@@ ite all that , I tried to understand him .
I didn &apos;t want to judge him with the same cru@@ el@@ ty that he jud@@ ged me .
The Arabic language doesn &apos;t satis@@ fy today &apos;s needs .
It &apos;s not a language for science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , a language we use in the work@@ place , a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t a language we use at the airport .
If we did so , they &apos;d strip us of our clothes .
Where can I use it , then ? We could all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are we to do so ?
This is one reality .
But we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
Arabic is the mother tongue .
Research says that ma@@ stery of other languages demands ma@@ stery of the mother tongue .
Ma@@ stery of the mother tongue is a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite for creative expression in other languages .
How ?
Gi@@ br@@ an K@@ hal@@ il Gi@@ br@@ an , when he first started writing , he used Arabic .
All his ideas , imagination and philosophy were inspired by this little boy in the village where he grew up , sm@@ elling a specific smell , hearing a specific voice , and thinking a specific thought .
So , when he started writing in English , he had enough b@@ ag@@ g@@ age .
Even when he wrote in English , when you read his writ@@ ings in English , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
You can imagine that that &apos;s him writing in English , the same boy who came from the mountain . From a village on Moun@@ t Le@@ ban@@ on .
So , this is an example no one can argue with .
Second , it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only way to kill a nation , is to kill its language .
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The Ger@@ mans , French , Japanese and Chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
That &apos;s why they legi@@ s@@ late to protect their language .
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
Do we know better than them ?
All right , we aren &apos;t from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civi@@ lized world .
Coun@@ tries that were once like us , but decided to stri@@ ve for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as Turkey , Mal@@ ay@@ sia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the l@@ adder , protected it like a diam@@ ond .
They kept it close to them .
Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not labeled in Tur@@ k@@ ish , then it isn &apos;t a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s a local product .
They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clu@@ eless consumers , like we are most of the time .
So , in order for them to innov@@ ate and produce , they had to protect their language .
If I say , &quot; &quot; Free@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , independence ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does this remind you of ?
It doesn &apos;t ring a be@@ ll , does it ?
Re@@ gard@@ less of the who , how and why .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t just for conver@@ sing , just words coming out of our mou@@ ths .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age represents specific stages in our lives , and ter@@ min@@ ology that is linked to our emotions .
So when we say , &quot; &quot; Free@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , independence , &quot; &quot; each one of you dra@@ ws a specific image in their own mind , there are specific feelings of a specific day in a specific historical period .
L@@ an@@ gu@@ age isn &apos;t one , two or three words or letters put together .
It &apos;s an idea inside that rel@@ ates to how we think , and how we see each other and how others see us .
What is our intell@@ ect ?
How do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
So , if I say , &quot; &quot; Free@@ dom , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , independence ( English ) , &quot; &quot; or if your son came up to you and said , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom ( English ) s@@ log@@ an ? &quot;
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem , then I &apos;d better leave , and stop talking in va@@ in .
The idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
I have a fr@@ anc@@ op@@ h@@ one friend who &apos;s married to a French man .
I asked her once how things were going .
She said , &quot; &quot; Everything is fine , but once , I spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i &apos; for him . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had mista@@ k@@ enly told him &quot; &quot; to@@ q@@ bor@@ n@@ i , &quot; &quot; and then spent the whole night trying to explain it to him .
He was puzz@@ led by the thought : &quot; &quot; How could anyone be this cru@@ el ?
Does she want to commit suicide ?
&apos;@@ B@@ ury me ? &apos; ( English ) &quot; &quot; This is one of the few examples .
It made us feel that she &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and he &apos;s right not to ; his way of thinking is different .
She said to me , &quot; &quot; He list@@ ens to F@@ air@@ u@@ z with me , and one night , I tried to translate for him so he can feel what I feel when I listen to F@@ air@@ u@@ z . &quot; &quot; The poor woman tried to translate this for him : &quot; From them I extended my hands and st@@ ole you — &quot; ( Laughter ) And here &apos;s the pick@@ le : &quot; And because you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you . &quot; ( Laughter )
Tr@@ ans@@ late that for me .
( Applause ) So , what have we done to protect the Arabic language ?
We turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the Arabic language .
Even though many people told me , &quot; &quot; Why do you bother ?
For@@ get about this head@@ ache and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The campaign to preserve Arabic launched a s@@ log@@ an that says , &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you rep@@ ly from the West . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; No ! We do not accept this or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this style because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
And when someone talks to me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want to change our reality , and be convinced in a way that refl@@ ects our dreams , aspi@@ rations and day@@ -to-@@ day life .
In a way that d@@ resses like us and thinks like we do .
So , &quot; &quot; I talk to you from the East , but you rep@@ ly from the West &quot; &quot; has hit the spot .
Something very easy , yet creative and persu@@ asive .
After that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
You &apos;ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
Why ? S@@ eri@@ ously , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill the language , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
We &apos;d have to find an existence .
We &apos;d go back to the beginning .
This is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civi@@ lized .
After that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter .
Ph@@ ot@@ os of &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; guys and girls .
We are very cool !
And to who@@ ever might say , &quot; &quot; H@@ a ! You used an English word ! &quot; &quot; I say , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &apos; cool . &apos; &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me a word that &apos;s nic@@ er and mat@@ ches the reality better .
I will keep on saying &quot; &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to the world wide web &quot; &quot; ( Laugh@@ s ) Because it doesn &apos;t fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves .
But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow anyone who is bigger or thinks they have any authority over us when it comes to language , to control us or make us think and feel what they want .
C@@ rea@@ tivity is the idea .
So , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
At this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
C@@ rea@@ tivity in your mother tongue is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this moment .
Let &apos;s write a novel or produce a short film .
A single novel could make us global again .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
So , it &apos;s not true that there &apos;s no solution ; there is a solution !
But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a du@@ ty to be part of that solution .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , twe@@ ets , who &apos;s twe@@ eting ?
Please , I be@@ g of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , English , French or Chinese .
But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers !
( Applause ) It &apos;s a disaster ! That &apos;s not a language .
You &apos;d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
It &apos;s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
That &apos;s the first thing we can do .
Second , there are many other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
We &apos;re here to bring attention to the necess@@ ity of preser@@ ving this language .
Now I will tell you a secret .
A baby first identi@@ fies its father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , hon@@ ey ( Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , hon@@ ey ( English ) . &quot; &quot; And in the supermarket , I promise my daughter No@@ or , that if she says to me , &quot; &quot; Thanks ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; D@@ is , &apos; Mer@@ c@@ i , Ma@@ man , &apos; &quot; &quot; and hope no one has heard her .
( Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cr@@ in@@ ge . ( Applause )
A few years ago , I felt like I was stuck in a r@@ ut , so I decided to follow in the foot@@ steps of the great American philosopher , M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ lock , and try something new for 30 days .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-@@ day challenges .
The first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memor@@ able .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
I would never have been that adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous before I started my 30-@@ day challenges .
I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough , you can do anything for 30 days .
By the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
You might be sle@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved , but you &apos;ll finish your novel .
It &apos;s awful .
( Laughter ) But for the rest of my life , if I meet John H@@ od@@ g@@ man at a TED party , I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m a computer scientist . &quot;
No , no , if I want to , I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a no@@ ve@@ list . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So here &apos;s one last thing I &apos;d like to mention .
I learned that when I made small , sustainable changes , things I could keep doing , they were more likely to stick .
In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
( Applause )
The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day bri@@ mming with hope and optimism .
I &apos;d done well at school . Ex@@ p@@ ec@@ tations for me were high , and I g@@ le@@ efully entered the student life of lec@@ tures , parties and traffic c@@ one the@@ ft .
Now appear@@ ances , of course , can be dec@@ ep@@ tive , and to an extent , this fe@@ ist@@ y , ener@@ ge@@ tic person@@ a of lec@@ tu@@ re-@@ going and traffic c@@ one ste@@ aling was a v@@ ene@@ er , al@@ be@@ it a very well-@@ cra@@ fted and convinc@@ ing one .
Un@@ der@@ neath , I was actually deeply unhappy , in@@ secure and fundamentally frighten@@ ed — frighten@@ ed of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emp@@ t@@ iness that I felt was within me .
But I was sk@@ illed at hiding it , and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and asp@@ ire to .
This fantas@@ y of inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability was so complete that I even dec@@ e@@ i@@ ved myself , and as the first se@@ me@@ ster ended and the second began , there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen .
I was leaving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hu@@ mming to myself , fu@@ mbling with my bag just as I &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly I heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly observe , &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
I looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and deci@@ si@@ ven@@ ess of the comment was un@@ mista@@ kable .
Sha@@ ken , I left my books on the stairs and hur@@ ried home , and there it was again .
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice had arrived .
And the voice persi@@ sted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , nar@@ rating everything I did in the third person .
&quot; She is going to a lecture . &quot;
It was neutral , imp@@ as@@ sive and even , after a while , stran@@ gely compan@@ i@@ on@@ ate and reas@@ sur@@ ing , although I did notice that its calm ex@@ ter@@ ior sometimes sli@@ pped and that it occasionally mir@@ ro@@ red my own un@@ expressed emotion .
So , for example , if I was angry and had to hide it , which I often did , being very a@@ dep@@ t at con@@ ce@@ aling how I really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
O@@ ther@@ wise , it was neither s@@ ini@@ ster nor disturb@@ ing , although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions , particularly emotions which were remote and in@@ accessible .
Now it was then that I made a fat@@ al mistake , in that I told a friend about the voice , and she was horri@@ fied .
A subtle condi@@ tioning process had begun , the impli@@ cation that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that I did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
Suddenly the voice didn &apos;t seem quite so ben@@ ign anymore , and when she insi@@ sted that I seek medical attention , I du@@ ly compli@@ ed , and which proved to be mistake number two .
I spent some time telling the college G@@ .@@ P@@ .
about what I perceived to be the real problem : anxiety , low self-@@ worth , fears about the future , and was met with bored in@@ difference until I mentioned the voice , upon which he dropped his pen , sw@@ ung round and began to question me with a show of real interest .
And to be fair , I was desper@@ ate for interest and help , and I began to tell him about my strange comm@@ ent@@ ator .
And I always wish , at this point , the voice had said , &quot; She is di@@ gging her own gra@@ ve . &quot;
I was refer@@ red to a psychi@@ atri@@ st , who like@@ wise took a gri@@ m view of the voice &apos;s presence , sub@@ sequ@@ ently interpre@@ ting everything I said through a lens of lat@@ ent ins@@ an@@ ity .
For example , I was part of a student TV station that broad@@ cast news bul@@ let@@ ins around the campus , and during an ap@@ point@@ ment which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , doctor , I &apos;ve got to go .
I &apos;m reading the news at six . &quot; &quot; Now it &apos;s down on my medical records that E@@ lean@@ or has del@@ usions that she &apos;s a television news broad@@ ca@@ ster .
It was at this point that events began to rapidly over@@ take me .
A hospital ad@@ mission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophren@@ ia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tor@@ menting sense of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , hu@@ mili@@ ation and despair about myself and my prosp@@ ects .
But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symp@@ tom , my fear and resistance towards it inten@@ si@@ fied .
Now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psych@@ ic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progres@@ sively hos@@ tile and men@@ ac@@ ing .
Hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly , I began to re@@ treat into this night@@ mar@@ ish inner world in which the voices were dest@@ ined to become both my per@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors and my only perceived compan@@ ions .
They told me , for example , that if I proved myself worthy of their help , then they could change my life back to how it had been , and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set , a kind of labor of Her@@ cul@@ es .
It started off quite small , for example , pull out three strands of hair , but gradually it grew more extreme , cul@@ min@@ ating in comman@@ ds to harm myself , and a particularly dramatic in@@ struction : &quot; &quot; You see that tu@@ tor over there ?
You see that glass of water ?
Well , you have to go over and p@@ our it over him in front of the other students . &quot; &quot; Which I actually did , and which need@@ less to say did not ende@@ ar me to the fac@@ ulty .
In effect , a v@@ ici@@ ous cycle of fear , avo@@ id@@ ance , mi@@ str@@ ust and mis@@ understanding had been established , and this was a battle in which I felt power@@ less and in@@ capable of establi@@ shing any kind of peace or recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
Two years later , and the deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation was dramatic .
By now , I had the whole fr@@ enz@@ ied re@@ per@@ to@@ ire : terrifying voices , gr@@ ot@@ es@@ que visions , bizarre , in@@ trac@@ table del@@ usions .
My mental health status had been a catal@@ y@@ st for discri@@ mination , ver@@ bal abuse , and physical and sexual as@@ sa@@ ult , and I &apos;d been told by my psychi@@ atri@@ st , &quot; &quot; E@@ lean@@ or , you &apos;d be better off with cancer , because cancer is easier to cure than schizophren@@ ia . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d been diagnosed , dru@@ gged and disc@@ arded , and was by now so tor@@ mented by the voices that I attemp@@ ted to drill a hole in my head in order to get them out .
Now looking back on the w@@ reck@@ age and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
A broken and ha@@ un@@ ted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survi@@ vor and would ultimately grow into the person I was dest@@ ined to be .
Many people have har@@ med me in my life , and I remember them all , but the memories grow p@@ ale and fa@@ int in comparison with the people who &apos;ve helped me .
The fellow survi@@ vors , the fellow vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ hear@@ ers , the com@@ ra@@ des and collabor@@ ators ; the mother who never gave up on me , who knew that one day I would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took ; the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who rein@@ forced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable , and during a devastating period of rel@@ ap@@ se told my terrified family , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t give up hope .
I believe that E@@ lean@@ or can get through this .
Sometimes , you know , it s@@ no@@ ws as late as May , but summer always comes eventually . &quot; &quot; F@@ our@@ teen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who wa@@ ited to welcome me back from that ag@@ on@@ ized , lonely place .
But together , they for@@ ged a bl@@ end of courage , creativity , integr@@ ity , and an un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able belief that my sh@@ at@@ tered self could become heal@@ ed and whole .
I used to say that these people saved me , but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself , and cruc@@ i@@ ally , they helped me to understand something which I &apos;d always susp@@ ected : that my voices were a meaningful response to trau@@ matic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my ene@@ mies but a source of insight into sol@@ vable emotional problems .
Now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hos@@ tile and men@@ ac@@ ing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaph@@ ori@@ cal meaning from what I &apos;d previously interpre@@ ted to be a liter@@ al truth .
So for example , voices which threatened to attack my home I learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and in@@ security in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
Now at first , I would have believed them .
I remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genu@@ ine threat from the voices .
Because I &apos;d had such a bad problem with self-@@ injury that most of the cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery in the house had been hidden , so I ended up ar@@ ming myself with a plastic for@@ k , kind of like pic@@ n@@ ic ware , and sort of sat outside the room cl@@ ut@@ ching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen .
It was like , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mess with me .
I &apos;ve got a plastic for@@ k , don &apos;t you know ? &quot; &quot; S@@ tr@@ ate@@ gic .
But a later response , and much more useful , would be to try and d@@ econ@@ struc@@ t the message behind the words , so when the voices war@@ ned me not to leave the house , then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how un@@ safe I felt — because if I was aware of it , then I could do something positive about it — but go on to reas@@ sure both them and myself that we were safe and didn &apos;t need to feel frighten@@ ed anymore .
I would set boundaries for the voices , and try to interact with them in a way that was as@@ ser@@ tive yet respec@@ t@@ ful , establi@@ shing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another .
Th@@ rough@@ out all of this , what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself , and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I &apos;d never had an opportunity to process or resol@@ ve , memories of sexual trauma and abuse , of anger , shame , guil@@ t , low self-@@ worth .
The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it , and possibly one of the greatest re@@ vel@@ ations was when I realized that the most hos@@ tile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly , and as such , it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care .
It was armed with this knowledge that ultimately I would gather together my sh@@ at@@ tered self , each fra@@ gment represented by a different voice , gradually with@@ draw from all my medication , and return to psychi@@ at@@ ry , only this time from the other side .
Ten years after the voice first came , I finally graduated , this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given , and one year later , the highest ma@@ sters , which shall we say isn &apos;t bad for a ma@@ d@@ woman .
In fact , one of the voices actually dic@@ t@@ ated the answers during the ex@@ am , which technically possibly coun@@ ts as che@@ ating .
( Laughter ) And to be honest , sometimes I quite enjoyed their attention as well .
As O@@ s@@ car Wil@@ de has said , the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about .
It also makes you very good at e@@ av@@ es@@ dropping , because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously .
I worked in mental health services , I spoke at con@@ fer@@ ences , I published book chap@@ ters and academic articles , and I argu@@ ed , and continue to do so , the relev@@ ance of the following concept : that an important question in psychi@@ at@@ ry shouldn &apos;t be what &apos;s wrong with you but rather what &apos;s happened to you .
And all the while , I listened to my voices , with whom I &apos;d finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion , accep@@ tance and respect towards myself .
And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terr@@ or@@ ized by her voices , and becoming fully aware , for the very first time , that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was .
I &apos;m now very proud to be a part of Inter@@ voice , the organiz@@ ational body of the International H@@ ear@@ ing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement , an initiative inspired by the work of Professor M@@ ari@@ us Rom@@ me and Dr. S@@ and@@ ra E@@ sch@@ er , which lo@@ cates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a s@@ ane reaction to ins@@ ane circumstances , not as an ab@@ er@@ r@@ ant symp@@ tom of schizophren@@ ia to be en@@ du@@ red , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
Together , we en@@ vis@@ age and en@@ act a society that understands and resp@@ ects voice hearing , supp@@ orts the needs of individuals who hear voices , and which values them as full citizens .
This type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
To par@@ aph@@ r@@ ase Cha@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , it cannot be rever@@ sed .
You cannot hu@@ mili@@ ate the person who feels pride .
You cannot op@@ press the people who are not afraid anymore .
For me , the achiev@@ ements of the H@@ ear@@ ing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement are a remin@@ der that empathy , fel@@ low@@ ship , justice and respect are more than words ; they are convic@@ tions and beliefs , and that beliefs can change the world .
In the last 20 years , the H@@ ear@@ ing Vo@@ ices Mo@@ vement has established hearing voices networks in 26 countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , soli@@ dar@@ ity and empo@@ wer@@ ment for individuals in mental dist@@ ress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an un@@ sha@@ kable belief in the power of the individual .
As Peter L@@ ev@@ ine has said , the human animal is a unique being en@@ do@@ wed with an instinc@@ tual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to har@@ ness this inn@@ ate capacity .
In this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facil@@ it@@ ating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
And like@@ wise , for survi@@ vors of dist@@ ress and ad@@ versity , that we remember we don &apos;t have to live our lives forever defined by the dama@@ ging things that have happened to us .
We are unique . We are ir@@ replac@@ e@@ able .
What lies within us can never be truly colon@@ ized , cont@@ or@@ ted , or taken away .
The light never goes out .
As a very wonderful doctor once said to me , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
Tell me about you . &quot; &quot; Thank you .

I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
Ph@@ ot@@ os like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it re@@ tains a level of re@@ alism .
Or photos like these — both dark and color@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ taining the level of re@@ alism .
When I say re@@ alism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
Ph@@ ot@@ os where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imagin@@ able physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with comb@@ ining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when comb@@ ining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ rements — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distingu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was compos@@ ed .
So by mat@@ ching color , contrast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the borders between the different images , adding photograp@@ hic def@@ ects like depth of field , des@@ at@@ ur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
( Laughter ) One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipul@@ ated .
But this image is actually entirely compos@@ ed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comprom@@ ise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The sho@@ res are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dish .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sket@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well planned .
And if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Ju@@ lian , welcome .
It &apos;s been reported that Wiki@@ Le@@ aks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classi@@ fied documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
Can that possibly be true ?
Ju@@ lian As@@ san@@ ge : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
It &apos;s a worry — isn &apos;t it ? — that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
CA : How does it work ?
How do people release the documents ?
And how do you secure their privacy ?
J@@ A : So these are — as far as we can tell — classi@@ cal whist@@ le@@ b@@ lowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
So we use this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art encryp@@ tion to boun@@ ce stuff around the Internet , to hide tra@@ ils , pass it through legal ju@@ ris@@ dic@@ tions like Sweden and Bel@@ gi@@ um to en@@ act those legal prot@@ ections .
We get information in the mail , the regular pos@@ tal mail , encryp@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a regular news organization , format it — which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant datab@@ ases of information — release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
CA : So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legi@@ timate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
J@@ A : That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
( Ph@@ one ring ) God damn it .
( Laughter ) CA : I think that &apos;s the C@@ I@@ A asking what the code is for a TED memb@@ ership . ( Laughter )
So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
This is something you lea@@ ked a few years ago .
If we can have this document up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you lea@@ ked and what happened ?
J@@ A : So this is the K@@ roll R@@ ep@@ ort .
This was a secret intelligence report com@@ mission@@ ed by the Ken@@ yan government after its election in 2004 .
Pri@@ or to 2004 , Kenya was rul@@ ed by D@@ ani@@ el ar@@ ap Mo@@ i for about 18 years .
He was a soft dic@@ t@@ ator of Kenya .
And when Ki@@ ba@@ ki got into power — through a co@@ ali@@ tion of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they com@@ mission@@ ed this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Mo@@ i , who was the ri@@ chest man — still is the ri@@ chest man — in Kenya .
It &apos;s the Ho@@ ly Gra@@ il of Ken@@ yan journalism .
So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just pri@@ or to the election — the national election , December 28 .
When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Ki@@ ba@@ ki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , D@@ ani@@ el ar@@ ap Mo@@ i , so this report then became a dead al@@ bat@@ r@@ oss around President Ki@@ ba@@ ki &apos;s neck .
CA : And — I mean , to cut a long story short — word of the report lea@@ ked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indi@@ rec@@ tly , and in your opinion , it actually shif@@ ted the election .
J@@ A : Yeah . So this became front page of the Gu@@ ar@@ dian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanz@@ an@@ ian and South African press .
And so it came in from the outside .
And that , after a couple of days , made the Ken@@ yan press feel safe to talk about it .
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Ken@@ yan TV , shif@@ ted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Ken@@ yan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
CA : Wow , so your lea@@ k really substanti@@ ally changed the world ?
J@@ A : Y@@ ep .
( Applause ) CA : Here &apos;s — We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Ba@@ gh@@ dad air@@ strike video .
The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
This is — this is intense material , I should war@@ n you .
Ra@@ dio : ... just f@@ uck@@ in &apos; , once you get on &apos; em just open &apos; em up .
I see your element , u@@ h , got about four H@@ um@@ ve@@ es , u@@ h , out along ...
You &apos;re clear . All right . Fir@@ ing .
Let me know when you &apos;ve got them . Let &apos;s shoot .
L@@ ight &apos; em all up .
C &apos;@@ mon , fire !
( Mach@@ ine gun fire ) Ke@@ ep shoot &apos; n . Ke@@ ep shoot &apos; n . ( Mach@@ ine gun fire ) Ke@@ ep shoot &apos; n .
H@@ ot@@ el ... B@@ ush@@ master Tw@@ o-@@ Six , B@@ ush@@ master Tw@@ o-@@ Six ,
we need to move , time now !
All right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
Yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicop@@ ters &#93; , and we &apos;re still fir@@ ing .
Ro@@ ger . I got &apos; em .
Tw@@ o-@@ Six , this is Tw@@ o-@@ Six , we &apos;re mobile .
O@@ ops , I &apos;m sorry . What was going on ?
God damn it , K@@ y@@ le . All right , ha@@ ha@@ ha . I hit &apos; em .
CA : So , what was the impact of that ?
J@@ A : The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
We ended up sending two people to Ba@@ gh@@ dad to further research that story .
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
CA : So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Re@@ u@@ ters employees ?
J@@ A : Yeah . Two Re@@ u@@ ters employees , two young children were w@@ ounded .
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
CA : And rele@@ asing this caused wi@@ des@@ pread ou@@ tra@@ ge .
What was the key element of this that actually caused the ou@@ tra@@ ge , do you think ?
J@@ A : I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gr@@ oss disp@@ arity in force .
You have guys walking in a rela@@ xed way down the street , and then an Ap@@ ache helicopter sitting up at one kilome@@ ter fir@@ ing 30-@@ milli@@ meter can@@ n@@ on sh@@ ells on everyone — looking for any exc@@ use to do so — and killing people resc@@ u@@ ing the w@@ ounded .
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insur@@ g@@ ents because that &apos;s their full-@@ time job .
CA : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analy@@ st , Bra@@ d@@ ley Man@@ ning , arrested , and it &apos;s alle@@ ged that he conf@@ essed in a ch@@ at room to have lea@@ ked this video to you , along with 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 classi@@ fied U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y ca@@ bles .
I mean , did he ?
J@@ A : We have den@@ ied receiving those ca@@ bles .
He has been charged , about five days ago , with ob@@ taining 15@@ 0,000 ca@@ bles and rele@@ asing 50 .
Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the R@@ ey@@ k@@ j@@ avi@@ k U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y , but this is not necessarily connected .
I mean , I was a known visit@@ or of that emb@@ ass@@ y .
CA : I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y diplom@@ atic ca@@ bles ...
J@@ A : We would have released them . ( CA : You would ? ) J@@ A : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? ) J@@ A : Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-@@ rights ab@@ uses in those governments .
If you look at decl@@ assi@@ fied ca@@ bles , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little more broad@@ ly about this .
I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right to encourage lea@@ king of secret information ?
J@@ A : Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So information that organizations are spending economic effort into con@@ ce@@ aling , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to con@@ ce@@ al it .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
CA : But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where lea@@ king can actually have an un@@ intended consequence ?
J@@ A : Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
I mean , we have a harm imm@@ un@@ ization policy .
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal — personally identi@@ fying information in it .
But there are legi@@ timate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legi@@ timate secret — but we deal with whist@@ le@@ b@@ lowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-@@ motivated .
CA : So they are well-@@ motivated .
And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
That gives the impres@@ sion , has given the impres@@ sion , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are in@@ human people .
Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How d@@ are you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
J@@ A : Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
But remember , the people in Ba@@ gh@@ dad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan — they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
L@@ ight is good .
But do you see any ir@@ ony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create sec@@ rec@@ y around your sources ?
J@@ A : Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any Wiki@@ Le@@ aks dis@@ si@@ dents yet .
We don &apos;t have sources who are dis@@ si@@ dents on other sources .
Should they come forward , that would be a trick@@ y situation for us , but we &apos;re presu@@ ma@@ bly acting in such a way that people feel mor@@ ally comp@@ elled to continue our mission , not to scre@@ w it up .
CA : I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
You know , there might be a couple of views of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks and of Ju@@ lian .
You know , hero — people &apos;s hero — bringing this important light .
D@@ ang@@ erous trou@@ ble@@ maker .
Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
Who &apos;s got the dangerous trou@@ ble@@ maker view ?
J@@ A : Oh , come on . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a soft crowd , Ju@@ lian , a soft crowd .
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet lea@@ ked , but I think for TED you are .
I mean it &apos;s an intrigu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
What is this ?
J@@ A : So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
So late last year — in November last year — there was a series of well b@@ low@@ outs in Al@@ ban@@ ia , like the well b@@ low@@ out in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
And we got a report — a sort of engineering analysis into what happened — saying that , in fact , security gu@@ ards from some ri@@ val , various competing oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked trucks there and blown them up .
And part of the Al@@ ban@@ ian government was in this , etc . , etc .
And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of skep@@ tical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look , we &apos;re skep@@ tical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t ver@@ i@@ fy it . &quot; &quot; And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot; &quot; And we were like , &quot; &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft W@@ ord I@@ D .
Yeah .
( Applause ) That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
This is like one of our methods of identi@@ fying , of ver@@ i@@ fying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
CA : Yeah . Have you had information from inside B@@ P ?
J@@ A : Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are under@@ going a sort of serious fund@@ raising and engineering effort .
So our publi@@ cation rate over the past few months has been sort of mini@@ mi@@ zed while we &apos;re re-@@ engineering our back systems for the phenomen@@ al public interest that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quanti@@ ty of whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clos@@ ures of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information .
CA : So that &apos;s the key bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck , basically journ@@ alistic volunteers and / or the funding of journ@@ alistic sal@@ aries ?
J@@ A : Y@@ ep . Yeah , and tru@@ sted people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to re@@ structure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
CA : So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 3@@ 7 different schools .
Can that be right ?
J@@ A : Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cul@@ t , so the combination between the two ...
( Laughter ) CA : I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding par@@ an@@ o@@ ia .
J@@ A : What , the movie business ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : And you were also — I mean , you were also a hack@@ er at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
J@@ A : Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
I wrote a magazine , was pros@@ ecu@@ ted for it when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with hack@@ er .
I mean there &apos;s like — there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian ma@@ fi@@ a in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
CA : Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re ste@@ aling anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some inci@@ dent in your life that helped determine them ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure about the inci@@ dent .
But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nur@@ ture victims .
And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
CA : Cap@@ able , generous men do not create victims ; they nur@@ ture victims ?
J@@ A : Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a comb@@ ative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nur@@ ture , but some way — there is another way of nur@@ turing victims , which is to police perpe@@ tr@@ ators of crime .
And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
CA : So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in I@@ cel@@ and ?
You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was inj@@ un@@ c@@ ted from running the story .
Instead , they publi@@ ci@@ zed your side .
That made you very high-@@ profile in I@@ cel@@ and . What happened next ?
J@@ A : Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
I@@ cel@@ and went through this financial crisis .
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
And the national TV station was inj@@ un@@ c@@ ted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : inj@@ un@@ ction landed on the news desk , and the news read@@ er was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a f@@ ill@@ er , and we became very famous in I@@ cel@@ and , went to I@@ cel@@ and and spoke about this issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with I@@ cel@@ an@@ dic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legisl@@ ation for I@@ cel@@ and to sort of become an off@@ shore haven for the free press , with the stron@@ gest journ@@ alistic prot@@ ections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
I@@ cel@@ and &apos;s a Nor@@ dic country , so , like Nor@@ way , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
And just a month ago , this was passed by the I@@ cel@@ an@@ dic par@@ liament un@@ anim@@ ously .
CA : Wow .
( Applause ) Last question , Ju@@ lian .
When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Bro@@ ther ex@@ er@@ ting more control , more sec@@ rec@@ y , or us watching Big Bro@@ ther , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
J@@ A : I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressu@@ res to har@@ mon@@ ize freedom of speech legisl@@ ation and transparency legisl@@ ation around the world — within the E.@@ U@@ . , between China and the United States .
Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
CA : Well , it looks like I &apos;m refl@@ ecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Ju@@ lian , be careful , and all power to you .
J@@ A : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m a story@@ t@@ eller .
That &apos;s what I do in life — telling stories , writing no@@ vels — and today I would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some super@@ natural creatures called the d@@ j@@ inn@@ i .
But before I go there , please allow me to share with you glimp@@ ses of my personal story .
I will do so with the help of words , of course , but also a geome@@ trical shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
I was born in S@@ tr@@ as@@ b@@ our@@ g , France to Tur@@ k@@ ish parents .
Sh@@ ort@@ ly after , my parents got separated , and I came to Turkey with my mom .
From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
Now in the early 1970s , in An@@ k@@ ar@@ a , that was a bit unusual .
Our neighborhood was full of large families , where fathers were the heads of house@@ holds , so I grew up seeing my mother as a divor@@ ce@@ e in a pat@@ ri@@ archa@@ l environment .
In fact , I grew up obser@@ ving two different kinds of wom@@ an@@ hood .
On the one hand was my mother , a well-@@ educated , sec@@ ular , modern , we@@ ster@@ n@@ ized , Tur@@ k@@ ish woman .
On the other hand was my grandmother , who also took care of me and was more spiritual , less educated and definitely less rational .
This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and mel@@ ted lead into mysterious shapes to f@@ end off the evil eye .
Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe ac@@ ne on their faces or war@@ ts on their hands .
Each time , my grandmother would u@@ tter some words in Arabic , take a red apple and sta@@ b it with as many rose thor@@ ns as the number of war@@ ts she wanted to remove .
Then one by one , she would enc@@ ir@@ cle these thor@@ ns with dark ink .
A week later , the patient would come back for a fol@@ low-@@ up exam@@ ination .
Now , I &apos;m aware that I should not be saying such things in front of an audience of schol@@ ars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , I did not see anyone go back unhappy or un@@ heal@@ ed .
I asked her how she did this . Was it the power of pra@@ ying ?
In response she said , &quot; &quot; Yes , pra@@ ying is effective , but also be@@ ware of the power of circles . &quot; &quot; From her , I learned , amongst many other things , one very precious lesson — that if you want to destroy something in this life , be it an ac@@ ne , a ble@@ mi@@ sh or the human soul , all you need to do is to surr@@ ound it with thick walls .
It will dry up inside .
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle .
We all do .
We &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
But if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted , then we too run the risk of dr@@ ying up inside .
Our imagination might shr@@ ink ; our hearts might d@@ wind@@ le , and our human@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we stay for too long inside our cultural co@@ co@@ ons .
Our friends , neighbors , colleagues , family — if all the people in our inner circle rese@@ mble us , it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .
Now one other thing women like my grand@@ ma do in Turkey is to cover mir@@ rors with vel@@ v@@ et or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out .
It &apos;s an old Eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it &apos;s not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
I@@ ron@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the greatest dang@@ ers of today &apos;s glob@@ alized world .
And it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liber@@ als and conserva@@ tives , ag@@ nos@@ tics and beli@@ e@@ vers , the rich and the poor , East and West ali@@ ke .
We tend to form clusters based on simil@@ arity , and then we produce stereotyp@@ es about other clusters of people .
In my opinion , one way of transc@@ ending these cultural gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is through the art of storytelling .
St@@ ories cannot demo@@ lish fron@@ ti@@ ers , but they can p@@ unch holes in our mental walls .
And through those holes , we can get a glimpse of the other , and sometimes even like what we see .
I started writing fiction at the age of eight .
My mother came home one day with a tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise not@@ e@@ book and asked me if I &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
In re@@ tr@@ osp@@ ect , I think she was slightly worried about my san@@ ity .
I was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except I told this to imagin@@ ary friends around me , which was not so good .
I was an intro@@ ver@@ ted child , to the point of communicating with colored cra@@ y@@ ons and apo@@ logi@@ zing to objects when I bu@@ mped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day@@ -to-@@ day experiences and emotions .
What she didn &apos;t know was that I thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write about myself .
Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
And thus began my life-@@ long passion for writing fiction .
So from the very beginning , fiction for me was less of an auto@@ bio@@ grap@@ hical manife@@ station than a transc@@ end@@ ental journey into other lives , other possibilities .
And please bear with me : I &apos;ll draw a circle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around this same time .
My mother became a diplom@@ at .
So from this small , super@@ sti@@ tious , middle-@@ class neighborhood of my grandmother , I was zo@@ om@@ ed into this pos@@ h , international school &#91; in Mad@@ rid &#93; , where I was the only Tur@@ k .
It was here that I had my first encounter with what I call the &quot; &quot; represen@@ tative fore@@ ig@@ ner . &quot; &quot; In our classroom , there were children from all na@@ tion@@ alities , yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cos@@ m@@ op@@ ol@@ itan , e@@ gal@@ itarian classroom democracy .
Instead , it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen — not as an individual on his own , but as the represen@@ tative of something larger .
We were like a mini@@ ature United Nations , which was fun , except whenever something negative , with reg@@ ards to a nation or a religion , took place .
The child who represented it was mo@@ cked , ridicul@@ ed and bul@@ lied end@@ lessly .
And I should know , because during the time I atten@@ ded that school , a military ta@@ ke@@ over happened in my country , a gun@@ man of my na@@ tionality nearly killed the P@@ ope , and Turkey got zero points in &#91; the &#93; Euro@@ vision S@@ ong Con@@ test .
( Laughter ) I ski@@ pped school often and dre@@ amed of becoming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotyp@@ es there .
The other children asked me about the movie &quot; &quot; M@@ id@@ night Ex@@ press , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they in@@ qu@@ ired how many cigaret@@ tes a day I smo@@ ked , because they thought all Tur@@ ks were heavy smo@@ kers , and they wondered at what age I would start covering my hair .
I came to learn that these were the three main stereotyp@@ es about my country : politics , cigaret@@ tes and the ve@@ il .
After Spain , we went to Jord@@ an , Germany and An@@ k@@ ar@@ a again .
Every@@ where I went , I felt like my imagination was the only su@@ it@@ case I could take with me .
St@@ ories gave me a sense of center , continu@@ ity and co@@ her@@ ence , the three big C@@ s that I otherwise l@@ acked .
In my mid-@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , I moved to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city I ad@@ ore .
I lived in a very vibr@@ ant , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of my no@@ vels .
I was in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l when the earthquake hit in 199@@ 9 .
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , I saw something that stopped me in my tracks .
There was the local gro@@ c@@ er there — a gr@@ ump@@ y , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to mar@@ gin@@ als .
He was sitting next to a trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te with a long black wi@@ g and ma@@ scar@@ a running down her che@@ e@@ ks .
I watched the man open a pack of cigaret@@ tes with tre@@ mbling hands and offer one to her , and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today — a conservative gro@@ c@@ er and a crying trans@@ v@@ esti@@ te smoking together on the side@@ walk .
In the face of death and destruction , our m@@ und@@ ane differences evapor@@ ated , and we all became one even if for a few hours .
But I &apos;ve always believed that stories , too , have a similar effect on us .
I &apos;m not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake , but when we are reading a good novel , we leave our small , co@@ zy apart@@ ments behind , go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been bi@@ ased against .
Sh@@ ort@@ ly after , I went to a women &apos;s college in Boston , then Mic@@ hi@@ gan .
I experienced this , not so much as a geograp@@ hical shift , as a lin@@ gu@@ istic one .
I started writing fiction in English .
I &apos;m not an immigr@@ ant , refugee or ex@@ ile — they ask me why I do this — but the comm@@ ute between languages gives me the chance to re@@ create myself .
I love writing in Tur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very poe@@ tic and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and cere@@ br@@ al .
So I feel connected to each language in a different way .
For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acqu@@ ired language .
When you &apos;re a lat@@ ec@@ om@@ er to a language , what happens is you live there with a continuous and perpe@@ tual fru@@ stration .
As lat@@ ec@@ om@@ ers , we always want to say more , you know , crack better jo@@ kes , say better things , but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
And that gap is very in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ating .
But if we manage not to be frighten@@ ed by it , it &apos;s also stimul@@ ating .
And this is what I discovered in Boston — that fru@@ stration was very stimul@@ ating .
At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily pra@@ yers that I ur@@ g@@ ently get married so that I could set@@ tle down once and for all .
And because God loves her , I did get married .
( Laughter ) But instead of sett@@ ling down , I went to Ari@@ z@@ ona .
And since my husband is in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , I started comm@@ u@@ ting between Ari@@ z@@ ona and I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l — the two places on the surface of earth that couldn &apos;t be more different .
I guess one part of me has always been a nom@@ ad , physically and spirit@@ ually .
St@@ ories ac@@ company me , keeping my pieces and memories together , like an exist@@ ential glue .
Yet as much as I love stories , recently , I &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
And this is a subject that I would love to think about together .
When my first novel written in English came out in America , I heard an interesting re@@ mark from a liter@@ ary cri@@ tic .
&quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you had written it differently . &quot;
( Laughter ) I asked him what he meant by that .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , look at it . There &apos;s so many Spanish , American , Hi@@ sp@@ anic characters in it , but there &apos;s only one Tur@@ k@@ ish character and it &apos;s a man . &quot; &quot; Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than Tur@@ k@@ ish characters , but I understood what my cri@@ tic was looking for .
And I also understood that I would keep disap@@ pointing him .
He wanted to see the manife@@ station of my identity .
He was looking for a Tur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because I happened to be one .
We often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circul@@ ated , read and re@@ viewed .
Many auth@@ ors feel this pressure , but non-@@ Western auth@@ ors feel it more heavi@@ ly .
If you &apos;re a woman writer from the Muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of Muslim women and , prefer@@ ably , the unhappy stories of unhappy Muslim women .
You &apos;re expected to write in@@ forma@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and character@@ istic stories and leave the experimental and av@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de to your Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child in that school in Mad@@ rid is happening in the liter@@ ary world today .
W@@ rit@@ ers are not seen as creative individuals on their own , but as the represen@@ ta@@ tives of their respec@@ tive cultures : a few auth@@ ors from China , a few from Turkey , a few from Nigeria .
We &apos;re all thought to have something very distinc@@ tive , if not peculiar .
The writer and comm@@ u@@ ter James Bal@@ d@@ win gave an interview in 198@@ 4 in which he was repe@@ at@@ edly asked about his hom@@ os@@ ex@@ uality .
When the inter@@ viewer tried to pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hole him as a gay writer , Bal@@ d@@ win stopped and said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you see ? There &apos;s nothing in me that is not in everybody else , and nothing in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity politics tries to put labe@@ ls on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
There &apos;s a fu@@ z@@ zy category called mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural literature in which all auth@@ ors from outside the Western world are lu@@ mped together .
I never forget my first mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural reading , in Harvard Square about 10 years ago .
We were three writers , one from the Phili@@ pp@@ ines , one Tur@@ k@@ ish and one In@@ don@@ es@@ ian — like a joke , you know .
( Laughter ) And the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a liter@@ ary taste .
It was only because of our pas@@ sports .
M@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural writers are expected to tell real stories , not so much the imagin@@ ary .
A function is attribu@@ ted to fiction .
In this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fic@@ tional characters become the represen@@ ta@@ tives of something larger .
But I must quickly add that this tendency to see a story as more than a story does not sole@@ ly come from the West .
It comes from everywhere .
And I experienced this fir@@ s@@ th@@ and when I was put on trial in 2005 for the words my fic@@ tional characters ut@@ tered in a novel .
I had intended to write a construc@@ tive , multi-@@ lay@@ ered novel about an Ar@@ men@@ ian and a Tur@@ k@@ ish family through the eyes of women .
My mic@@ ro story became a m@@ acr@@ o issue when I was pros@@ ecu@@ ted .
Some people critici@@ zed , others p@@ raised me for writing about the Tur@@ ki@@ sh@@ -@@ Ar@@ men@@ ian conflict .
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
It was just a story .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not trying to be@@ little my work .
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
W@@ rit@@ ers are enti@@ tled to their political opinions , and there are good political no@@ vels out there , but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics .
Che@@ k@@ ho@@ v said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of pos@@ ing the question are two completely separate things .
And only the lat@@ ter is an artist &apos;s responsibility . &quot; &quot; I@@ denti@@ ty politics divi@@ des us . F@@ ic@@ tion connects .
One is interested in swe@@ eping gener@@ aliz@@ ations .
The other , in nu@@ ances .
One dra@@ ws boundaries .
The other recogn@@ iz@@ es no fron@@ ti@@ ers .
I@@ denti@@ ty politics is made of solid bri@@ cks .
F@@ ic@@ tion is flowing water .
In the O@@ t@@ tom@@ an times , there were it@@ in@@ er@@ ant story@@ t@@ ell@@ ers called &quot; &quot; me@@ dd@@ ah . &quot; &quot; They would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often improvi@@ sing .
With each new person in the story , the me@@ dd@@ ah would change his voice , im@@ person@@ ating that character .
Everybody could go and listen , you know — ordinary people , even the sul@@ tan , Muslims and non-@@ Muslims .
St@@ ories cut across all boundaries , like &quot; &quot; The T@@ ales of N@@ as@@ re@@ dd@@ in H@@ od@@ j@@ a , &quot; &quot; which were very popular throughout the Middle East , North Africa , the Bal@@ k@@ ans and Asia .
Today , stories continue to transc@@ end borders .
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk , they usually don &apos;t listen to each other , but a Palestinian read@@ er still reads a novel by a Jewish author , and vice vers@@ a , connecting and emp@@ ath@@ izing with the nar@@ r@@ ator .
Lit@@ er@@ ature has to take us beyond .
If it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
B@@ oo@@ ks have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mid child that I was — that I once was .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger of fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ izing them .
When the poet and my@@ stic , R@@ um@@ i , met his spiritual compan@@ ion , Sha@@ ms of T@@ ab@@ ri@@ z , one of the first things the lat@@ ter did was to t@@ oss R@@ um@@ i &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dis@@ solve .
The Su@@ f@@ is say , &quot; &quot; K@@ now@@ le@@ dge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot; &quot; The problem with today &apos;s cultural gh@@ et@@ to@@ s is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about each other , or so we think — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : it makes us eli@@ ti@@ st , distant and dis@@ connected .
There &apos;s a metaphor which I love : living like a drawing comp@@ ass .
As you know , one leg of the comp@@ ass is static , ro@@ oted in a place .
Me@@ an@@ while , the other leg dra@@ ws a wide circle , constantly moving .
Like that , my fiction as well .
One part of it is ro@@ oted in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l , with strong Tur@@ k@@ ish roots , but the other part tra@@ vels the world , connecting to different cultures .
In that sense , I like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
Now those of you who have been to I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l have probably seen T@@ op@@ k@@ ap@@ i Pal@@ ace , which was the resi@@ dence of O@@ t@@ tom@@ an sul@@ t@@ ans for more than 400 years .
In the pal@@ ace , just outside the quarters of the favorite con@@ cu@@ b@@ ines , there &apos;s an area called The Ga@@ ther@@ ing Pl@@ ace of the D@@ j@@ in@@ n .
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m intrigu@@ ed by this concept .
We usually distr@@ ust those areas that fall in between things .
We see them as the domain of super@@ natural creatures like the d@@ j@@ in@@ n , who are made of smo@@ k@@ eless fire and are the symbol of el@@ usi@@ ven@@ ess .
But my point is perhaps that el@@ usive space is what writers and artists need most .
When I write fiction I ch@@ er@@ ish el@@ usi@@ ven@@ ess and chan@@ ge@@ ability .
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I might write about a Muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , I might write about a hand@@ some , gay professor in Nor@@ way .
As long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
Au@@ d@@ re L@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to say , &apos; I think , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; &quot; She suggested , &quot; &quot; I feel , therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses today , the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; write what you know &quot; &quot; ?
Perhaps that &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
Imag@@ in@@ ative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is about .
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
We should get out of our cultural gh@@ et@@ to and go visit the next one and the next .
In the end , stories move like wh@@ ir@@ ling der@@ vi@@ shes , drawing circles beyond circles .
They connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
And I would like to finish with an old Su@@ f@@ i poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lo@@ vers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you .
( Applause )
My big idea is a very , very small idea that can un@@ lock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dor@@ m@@ ant inside us .
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) This is a room of ty@@ pe@@ -@@ A women . This is a room
of sle@@ ep@@ -@@ de@@ pri@@ ved women .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Tw@@ o-@@ and-@@ a-half years ago , I fa@@ in@@ ted from exha@@ us@@ tion .
I hit my head on my desk . I broke my che@@ e@@ k@@ bone , I got five sti@@ t@@ ches on my right eye .
And I began the journey of re@@ discovering the value of sleep .
And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more jo@@ y@@ ful life is getting enough sleep .
( Applause ) And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Because unfortunately for men , sleep de@@ pri@@ vation has become a vi@@ ri@@ l@@ ity symbol .
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bra@@ gged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
And I felt like saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt like saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) There is now a kind of sleep de@@ pri@@ vation one-@@ up@@ man@@ ship .
E@@ speci@@ ally here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; &quot; E@@ ight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of ten@@ n@@ is in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
So a high I.@@ Q@@ .
does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the ice@@ berg before it hits the Tit@@ anic .
And we &apos;ve had far too many ice@@ ber@@ gs hitting our Tit@@ an@@ ics .
In fact , I have a feeling that if Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers was Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers and S@@ ist@@ ers , they might still be around .
( Applause ) While all the brothers were busy just being hyper@@ -@@ connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the ice@@ berg , because she would have wo@@ ken up from a seven@@ -and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ - or eigh@@ t-@@ hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
So as we are facing all the multiple cri@@ ses in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gra@@ titude , eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ eness in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your eng@@ ines and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .
( Applause )
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder , schizophren@@ ia .
What is it about my brother &apos;s brain and his schizophren@@ ia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality , so they instead become del@@ usion ?
And I moved from my home state of Indi@@ ana to Boston , where I was working in the lab of Dr. Fr@@ anc@@ ine Ben@@ es , in the Harvard Department of P@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry .
And in the lab , we were asking the question , &quot; &quot; What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control , as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophren@@ ia , schiz@@ o@@ aff@@ ective or bi@@ polar disorder ? &quot; &quot; So we were essentially mapping the micro@@ circu@@ it@@ ry of the brain : which cells are communicating with which cells , with which chemicals , and then in what quanti@@ ties of those chemicals ?
But on the morning of December 10 , 199@@ 6 , I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own .
I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two he@@ mi@@ sp@@ her@@ es are completely separate from one another .
This is the front of the brain , the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down , and this is how it would be posi@@ tioned inside of my head .
For those of you who understand computers , our right he@@ mi@@ sphere functions like a parallel process@@ or , while our left he@@ mi@@ sphere functions like a seri@@ al process@@ or .
But other than that , the two he@@ mi@@ sp@@ her@@ es are completely separate .
Because they process information differently , each of our he@@ mi@@ sp@@ her@@ es think about different things , they care about different things , and , d@@ are I say , they have very different person@@ alities .
Ex@@ c@@ use me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy .
It &apos;s all about &quot; &quot; right here , right now . &quot; &quot; Our right he@@ mi@@ sphere , it thinks in pictures and it lear@@ ns kin@@ esthe@@ tically through the movement of our bodies .
In@@ formation , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explo@@ des into this enormous coll@@ age of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment sm@@ ells like and ta@@ st@@ es like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
I am an ener@@ g@@ y-@@ being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right he@@ mi@@ sphere .
And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
My left he@@ mi@@ sphere , our left he@@ mi@@ sphere , is a very different place .
Our left he@@ mi@@ sphere thinks lin@@ early and metho@@ dic@@ ally .
Our left he@@ mi@@ sphere is designed to take that enormous coll@@ age of the present moment and start picking out details , and more details about those details .
And our left he@@ mi@@ sphere thinks in language .
It &apos;s that ongoing brain ch@@ at@@ ter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .
It &apos;s that little voice that says to me , &quot; &quot; Hey , you &apos;ve got to remember to pick up ban@@ an@@ as on your way home .
I need them in the morning . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s that calcul@@ ating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my la@@ und@@ ry .
And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; &quot; OK , I &apos;ll just start my normal rou@@ tine . &quot; &quot; So I got up and I jumped onto my car@@ dio gli@@ der , which is a full-@@ body , full-@@ exercise machine .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s very peculiar . &quot; &quot; And I looked down at my body and I thought , &quot; &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a , I &apos;m a we@@ ir@@ d-@@ looking thing . &quot; &quot; And it was as though my consciousness had shif@@ ted away from my normal perception of reality , where I &apos;m the person on the machine having the experience , to some es@@ ot@@ er@@ ic space where I &apos;m witn@@ essing myself having this experience .
So I get off the machine , and I &apos;m walking across my living room floor , and I realize that everything inside of my body has s@@ lowed way down .
And I &apos;m standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the sho@@ wer , and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body .
You muscles , you rela@@ x . &quot; &quot; And then I lost my balance , and I &apos;m pro@@ pped up against the wall .
I can &apos;t define where I begin and where I end , because the atoms and the molecules of my arm bl@@ ended with the atoms and molecules of the wall .
And all I could detect was this energy — energy .
And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
So here I am in this space , and my job , and any stress related to my job — it was gone .
And I felt ligh@@ ter in my body .
And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any st@@ res@@ s@@ ors related to any of those — they were gone .
( Laughter ) Oh ! I felt eu@@ ph@@ or@@ ia — eu@@ ph@@ or@@ ia .
And again , my left he@@ mi@@ sphere comes online and it says , &quot; &quot; Hey ! You &apos;ve got to pay attention .
We &apos;ve got to get help . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get help . I &apos;ve got to focus . &quot; &quot; So I get out of the sho@@ wer and I mechan@@ ically dress and I &apos;m walking around my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got to get to work . Can I drive ? &quot; &quot; And in that moment , my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side .
Then I realized , &quot; &quot; Oh my gos@@ h ! I &apos;m having a stroke ! &quot; &quot; And the next thing my brain says to me is , Wow ! This is so cool !
How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And then it cros@@ ses my mind , &quot; &quot; But I &apos;m a very busy woman ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; I don &apos;t have time for a stroke ! &quot;
So I &apos;ve got to call help . I &apos;ve got to call work . &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t remember the number at work , so I remembered , in my office I had a business card with my number .
I take the business card , I put it right here , and I &apos;m mat@@ ching the shape of the squ@@ ig@@ gl@@ es on the card to the shape of the squ@@ ig@@ gl@@ es on the phone p@@ ad .
But then I would dri@@ ft back out into La La L@@ and , and not remember when I came back if I &apos;d already di@@ aled those numbers .
So I had to wi@@ eld my paralyzed arm like a stu@@ mp and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them , so that as I would come back to normal reality , I &apos;d be able to tell , &quot; &quot; Yes , I &apos;ve already di@@ aled that number . &quot; &quot; E@@ ven@@ tually , the whole number gets di@@ aled and I &apos;m listening to the phone , and my colleague pic@@ ks up the phone and he says to me , &quot; &quot; W@@ o@@ o wo@@ o wo@@ o wo@@ o . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I think to myself , &quot; Oh my gos@@ h , he sounds like a Gol@@ den Re@@ tri@@ ever ! &quot; ( Laughter )
And what comes out of my voice is , &quot; &quot; W@@ o@@ o wo@@ o wo@@ o wo@@ o wo@@ o . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; Oh my gos@@ h , I sound like a Gol@@ den Re@@ tri@@ ever . &quot; &quot; So I couldn &apos;t know — I didn &apos;t know that I couldn &apos;t speak or understand language until I tried .
And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life , or this was perhaps my moment of transition .
And my mind was now suspen@@ ded between two very opposite planes of reality .
And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be , what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives .
Or , I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left he@@ mi@@ sphere , where I become a single individual , a solid .
I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep in@@ ner@@ -@@ peace circu@@ it@@ ry of our right he@@ mi@@ sp@@ her@@ es , the more peace we will project into the world , and the more peaceful our planet will be .
