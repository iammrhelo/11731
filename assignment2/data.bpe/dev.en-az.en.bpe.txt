When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to B@@ BC Ne@@ ws on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; &quot; my father shou@@ ted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to esc@@ ort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in grocer@@ y bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
It was co@@ zy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives — the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be c@@ anc@@ eled for a week because Taliban were suspic@@ ious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and daughters were tre@@ as@@ ured .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total ma@@ ver@@ ick from a remote pro@@ v@@ ince of Afghanistan , he insi@@ sted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She reti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father — that &apos;s him — he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educa@@ ting his children .
During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot; &quot; Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fe@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ b@@ ury College .
( Applause ) When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to educate his daughters , was among the first to con@@ grat@@ ulate me .
He not only bra@@ gs about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l .
( Applause ) My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ dor for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educate women .
That &apos;s why I co@@ founded S@@ O@@ LA , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion grab@@ bing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position .
Like A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students .
L@@ ess than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ LA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a ro@@ ad@@ side bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone ran@@ g , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; &quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wish , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot; &quot; What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recogn@@ iz@@ es the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convinc@@ ing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Un@@ der the Taliban , girls who went to school nu@@ mb@@ ered in the hundreds — remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
( Applause ) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the frag@@ ility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ ops &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a prom@@ ising future and la@@ sting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bound@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ LA remind me of that .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We &apos;re going to go on a dive to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly posi@@ tively p@@ itch@@ -@@ black world .
And you see , some of the biolumin@@ escence they use to avoid being eaten , some they use to attract pre@@ y , but all of it , from an artistic point of view , is just posi@@ tively amazing .
And a lot of what goes on inside — There &apos;s a fish with g@@ lowing eyes , pul@@ s@@ ating eyes .
Some of the colors are designed to h@@ yp@@ no@@ tize , these lovely patterns .
And then this last one , one of my favor@@ ites , this pin@@ wheel design .
Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
That &apos;s the unknown world , and today we &apos;ve only explored about 3 percent of what &apos;s out there in the ocean .
Al@@ ready we &apos;ve found the world &apos;s highest mountains , the world &apos;s deepest val@@ le@@ ys , underwater la@@ kes , underwater water@@ falls — a lot of that we shared with you from the stage .
Here &apos;s an oc@@ top@@ us moving across the reef , finds a spot to set@@ tle down , cur@@ ls up and then dis@@ appears into the background .
Now , here &apos;s a male on the left and a female on the right , and the male has managed to split his color@@ ation so the female only always sees the kin@@ der , gent@@ ler squ@@ id in him .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a look at it again . W@@ atch the color@@ ation : white on the right , brown on the left .
He takes a step back , he &apos;s keeping off the other males by spl@@ itting his body , and comes up on the other side — B@@ in@@ go !
( Laughter ) C@@ ut@@ t@@ le@@ fish . I love cu@@ tt@@ le@@ fish .
Here we &apos;re going to see one b@@ acking into a cre@@ vice , and watch his t@@ ent@@ acles — he just pulls them in , makes them look just like al@@ ga@@ e .
Dis@@ appears right into the background .
His motion bl@@ ends right into the background — the moving rock trick .
Here &apos;s some al@@ ga@@ e in the fore@@ ground — and an oc@@ top@@ us .
Now , Ro@@ ger sp@@ oo@@ ked him , so he took off in a cloud of ink , and when he lands , the oc@@ top@@ us says , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been seen .
The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get . &quot; &quot; That big brown makes his ey@@ es@@ po@@ t very big .
So , he &apos;s blu@@ ff@@ ing . Let &apos;s do it backwards .
One , two , three .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Ki@@ m I@@ l-@@ Sun@@ g , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the ene@@ mies .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public exec@@ ution .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
So@@ on after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that to this day I can &apos;t er@@ ase from my memory .
Po@@ wer out@@ ages also became more and more frequ@@ ent , so everything around me was completely dark at night , except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
This is the Am@@ no@@ k River , which ser@@ ves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated to a horrible fate , back in North Korea .
One day , my worst night@@ m@@ are came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police , and brought to the police station for inter@@ ro@@ gation .
If anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated .
But I managed to control all the emotions inside me , and answer the questions .
After they finished ques@@ tioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report . She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
But many can be caught by the Chinese police , and re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
S@@ et@@ t@@ ling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different , due to 6@@ 7 years of division .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
So I started planning how to help them escape .
So , ir@@ on@@ ically , I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean border .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
As the Chinese officer approached my family , I impul@@ sively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chap@@ er@@ oning .
After I paid the fine and bri@@ be , my family was released in one month .
But soon after , my family was arrested and ja@@ iled again , in the capital of La@@ os .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail , just a short distance from the South Korean emb@@ ass@@ y .
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hes@@ it@@ ating , the man went to the A@@ T@@ M , and he paid the rest of the money for my family , and two other North Kore@@ ans to get out of jail .
I realized that this was a symbo@@ lic moment in my life .
Many North Kore@@ ans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succe@@ eding all over the world , including the TED stage .
This is a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten we designed in 2007 .
We made this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten to be a circle .
It &apos;s a kind of end@@ less circul@@ ation on top of the roof .
If you are a parent , you know that kids love to keep making circles .
This is how the roof@@ top looks .
And why did we design this ?
The princi@@ pal of this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want a hand@@ ra@@ il . &quot;
I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; But he insi@@ sted : &quot; &quot; How about having a net stic@@ king out from the edge of the roof ?
So that it can catch the children falling off ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s impossible . &quot; &quot; And of course , the government official said , &quot; Of course you have to have a hand@@ ra@@ il . &quot;
But we could keep that idea around the trees .
There are three trees p@@ opping through .
And we were allowed to call this ro@@ pe as a hand@@ ra@@ il .
But of course , ro@@ pe has nothing to do with them .
They fall into the net .
And you get more , and more , more .
( Laughter ) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree .
The boy on the branch , he loves the tree so he is eating the tree .
( Laughter ) And at the time of an event , they sit on the edge .
It looks so nice from underneath .
Mon@@ keys in the zo@@ o .
( Laughter ) Fe@@ eding time .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And we made the roof as low as possible , because we wanted to see children on top of the roof , not only underneath the roof .
And if the roof is too high , you see only the ceiling .
And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water t@@ aps .
You see with the flexible tubes , you want to sp@@ ray water to your friends , and the sho@@ wer , and the one in front is quite normal .
But if you look at this , the boy is not washing his bo@@ ots , he &apos;s putting water into his bo@@ ots .
( Laughter ) This kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten is completely open , most of the year .
And there is no boundary between inside and outside .
So it means basically this architecture is a roof .
And also there is no boundary between classrooms .
So there is no acou@@ stic barrier at all .
When you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
But in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , there is no reason they get nervous .
Because there is no boundary .
And the princi@@ pal says if the boy in the corner doesn &apos;t want to stay in the room , we let him go .
He will come back eventually , because it &apos;s a circle , it comes back .
( Laughter ) But the point is , in that kind of occa@@ sion , usually children try to hide somewhere .
But here , just they leave and come back .
It &apos;s a natural process .
And secon@@ dly , we consider noise very important .
You know that children sleep better in noise .
They don &apos;t sleep in a quiet space .
And in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , these children show amazing concentration in class .
And you know , our kind grew up in the jun@@ gle with noise .
They need noise .
And you know , you can talk to your friends in a no@@ is@@ y bar .
You are not supposed to be in silence .
And you know , these days we are trying to make everything under control .
You know , it &apos;s completely open .
And you should know that we can go ski@@ ing in -@@ 20 degrees in winter .
In summer you go swimming .
The sand is 50 degrees .
And also , you should know that you are water@@ proof .
You never melt in rain .
So , children are supposed to be outside .
So that is how we should treat them .
This is how they divide classrooms .
They are supposed to help teachers .
They don &apos;t .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t put him in .
A classroom .
And a wash@@ bas@@ in .
They talk to each other around the well .
And there are always some trees in the classroom .
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above .
( Laughter ) Mon@@ keys . ( Laughter )
And each classroom has at least one sky@@ light .
And this is where S@@ anta C@@ lau@@ s comes down at the time of Christmas .
This is the an@@ ne@@ x building , right next to that o@@ val@@ -@@ shaped kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
The building is only five meters tall with seven flo@@ ors .
And of course , the ceiling height is very low .
So you have to consider safety .
So , we put our children , a daughter and a son .
They tried to go in .
He hit his head .
He &apos;s okay . His skull is quite strong .
He is resili@@ ent . It &apos;s my son .
( Laughter ) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off .
And then we put other children .
The traffic j@@ am is awful in To@@ k@@ yo , as you know .
( Laughter ) The driver in front , she needs to learn how to drive .
Now these days , kids need a small d@@ os@@ age of danger .
And in this kind of occa@@ sion , they learn to help each other .
This is society . This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days .
Now , this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9 : 10 and 9 : 30 .
And the circum@@ ference of this building is 18@@ 3 meters .
So it &apos;s not exactly small at all .
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning .
But the surprise is yet to come .
The children in this kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten do 4,000 meters on average .
And these children have the highest athle@@ tic abilities among many kin@@ der@@ gar@@ tens .
The princi@@ pal says , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t train them . We leave them on top of the roof .
Just like sheep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) They keep running . ( Laughter )
My point is don &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too much , and they need to tu@@ mble sometimes .
They need to get some injury .
And that makes them learn how to live in this world .
I think architecture is capable of changing this world , and people &apos;s lives .
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children .
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
So I was trained to become a gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an , China in the 1970s .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all exp@@ en@@ ses paid .
But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; &quot; No . &quot; &quot; My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
After survi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tural Revolution , they fir@@ m@@ ly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-@@ paid job .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera sing@@ er .
That is me playing my imagin@@ ary piano .
An opera sing@@ er must start training young to learn ac@@ ro@@ ba@@ tics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
I even wrote to the school princi@@ pal and the host of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fair .
So I was determined to find another calling .
Nobody around to teach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I satis@@ fied my hunger for par@@ ental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ respon@@ dence in the Fa@@ mi@@ ly of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Con@@ f@@ uc@@ ian tradition requires obe@@ dience . &#91; &quot; &quot; Jane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; &quot; Che@@ aper by the Do@@ zen &quot; &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study ab@@ road after reading these .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ple@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o &quot; &quot; ( a@@ ka E@@ ch@@ o C@@ han ) &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons From Hi@@ story &quot; &quot; by N@@ an Hu@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S. in 199@@ 5 , so which books did I read here first ?
B@@ oo@@ ks ban@@ ned in China , of course .
&quot; &quot; The Good Earth &quot; &quot; is about Chinese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not convenient for propag@@ anda . G@@ ot it .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
But the fifth comman@@ d@@ ment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Hon@@ or , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obe@@ y . &quot; &quot; So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Con@@ f@@ uc@@ ian guil@@ t trap and to re@@ start my relationship with my parents .
En@@ counter@@ ing a new culture also started my habit of compar@@ ative reading .
It offers many insights .
For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
Com@@ par@@ ative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
There are even research fields such as compar@@ ative religion and compar@@ ative literature .
Com@@ pare and contrast gives schol@@ ars a more complete understanding of a topic .
So I thought , well , if compar@@ ative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So I started reading books in pairs .
So they can be about people — &#91; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ jam@@ in Frank@@ lin &quot; &quot; by Wal@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; John Ad@@ ams &quot; &quot; by David Mc@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; — who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
&#91; &quot; &quot; Per@@ son@@ al Hi@@ story &quot; &quot; by K@@ ath@@ ar@@ ine Gra@@ ham &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; The S@@ now@@ ball : W@@ arre@@ n Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and the Bus@@ iness of Life , &quot; &quot; by A@@ lice Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der &#93; I also compare the same stories in different gen@@ res — ( Laughter ) &#91; Ho@@ ly Bible : King James Ver@@ sion &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; L@@ am@@ b &quot; &quot; by Ch@@ ris@@ op@@ her Moore &#93; — or similar stories from different cultures , as Jos@@ ep@@ h C@@ amp@@ be@@ ll did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; &quot; The Po@@ wer of My@@ th &quot; &quot; by Jos@@ ep@@ h C@@ amp@@ be@@ ll &#93; For example , both the Chri@@ st and the Budd@@ ha went through three temp@@ tations .
For the Chri@@ st , the temp@@ tations are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Budd@@ ha , they are all psychological : l@@ ust , fear and social du@@ ty — interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; &quot; The W@@ ay of C@@ hu@@ ang T@@ z@@ u &quot; &quot; Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; &quot; Ta@@ o : The Wat@@ er@@ course W@@ ay &quot; &quot; Al@@ an Wat@@ ts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; &quot; happiness &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; fast joy . &quot; &quot; Hu@@ h !
&quot; &quot; Bri@@ de &quot; &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; &quot; new mother . &quot; &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
( Laughter ) B@@ oo@@ ks have given me a magic port@@ al to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lonely or power@@ less again .
Ha@@ ving a dream sh@@ at@@ tered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a sh@@ at@@ tered dream can do that for you .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
P@@ ic@@ ture this : It &apos;s Mon@@ day morning , you &apos;re at the office , you &apos;re sett@@ ling in for the day at work , and this guy that you sort of recognize from down the hall , walks right into your cu@@ bic@@ le and he ste@@ als your chair .
Do@@ esn &apos;t say a word — just ro@@ lls away with it .
Do@@ esn &apos;t give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that are out there .
Do@@ esn &apos;t acknowledge the fact that you might need your chair to get some work done today .
You wouldn &apos;t stand for it . You &apos;d make a st@@ ink .
You &apos;d follow that guy back to his cu@@ bic@@ le and you &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Why my chair ? &quot; &quot; Okay , so now it &apos;s Tu@@ es@@ day morning and you &apos;re at the office , and a meeting inv@@ itation pop@@ s up in your cal@@ end@@ ar .
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall , and the subject line refer@@ ences some project that you heard a little bit about .
And when this highly un@@ productive session is over , you go back to your desk , and you stand at your desk and you say , &quot; &quot; Boy , I wish I had those two hours back , like I wish I had my chair back . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Every day , we allow our co@@ workers , who are otherwise very , very nice people , to steal from us .
And I &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
I &apos;m talking about time . Your time .
In fact , I believe that we are in the middle of a global epidemic of a terrible new illness known as M@@ A@@ S : M@@ ind@@ less Ac@@ cept Sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome .
( Laughter ) The primary symp@@ tom of M@@ ind@@ less Ac@@ cept Sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome is just accep@@ ting a meeting inv@@ itation the minute it pop@@ s up in your cal@@ end@@ ar . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s an invol@@ un@@ tary re@@ fle@@ x — ding , click , bing — it &apos;s in your cal@@ end@@ ar , &quot; &quot; G@@ ot@@ ta go , I &apos;m already late for a meeting . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Me@@ et@@ ings are important , right ?
And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise .
And a well-@@ run meeting can yield really positive , ac@@ tion@@ able results .
But between globalization and per@@ v@@ asive information technology , the way that we work has really changed dramatically over the last few years .
And we &apos;re miserable . ( Laughter ) And we &apos;re miserable not because the other guy can &apos;t run a good meeting , it &apos;s because of M@@ A@@ S , our M@@ ind@@ less Ac@@ cept Sy@@ n@@ dr@@ ome , which is a self-@@ inf@@ lic@@ ted wound .
Actually , I have evidence to prove that M@@ A@@ S is a global epidemic .
Let me tell you why .
A couple of years ago , I put a video on You@@ tube , and in the video , I acted out every terrible conference call you &apos;ve ever been on .
It goes on for about five minutes , and it has all the things that we hate about really bad meetings .
There &apos;s the moder@@ ator who has no idea how to run the meeting .
There are the participants who have no idea why they &apos;re there .
And everybody leaves very angry .
It &apos;s kind of funny .
( Laughter ) Let &apos;s take a quick look .
( Video ) Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important propos@@ al .
As a group , we need to decide if — bloo@@ p bloo@@ p — Hi , who just joined ?
Hi , it &apos;s Joe . I &apos;m working from home today .
( Laughter ) Hi , Joe . Thanks for jo@@ ining us today , great .
I was just saying , we have a lot of people on the call we &apos;d like to get through , so let &apos;s ski@@ p the roll call and I &apos;m gonna dive right in .
As a group , we need to decide if — bloo@@ p bloo@@ p — ( Laughter ) Hi , who just joined ?
No ? I thought I heard a be@@ ep . ( Laughter ) S@@ ound familiar ?
Yeah , it sounds familiar to me , too .
A couple of weeks after I put that online , 5@@ 00,000 people in dozens of countries , I mean dozens of countries , watched this video .
And three years later , it &apos;s still getting thousands of views every month .
And if the numbers — there are a million views and it &apos;s being used by all these companies — aren &apos;t enough proof that we have a global problem with meetings , there are the many , many thousands of comments posted online after the video went up .
So I used to emb@@ ark on these imagin@@ ary jour@@ neys to find inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic objects from planet K@@ ryp@@ ton , which was a lot of fun , but didn &apos;t yield much result .
When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for super@@ powers , I decided instead to emb@@ ark on a journey of real science , to find a more useful truth .
I started my journey in California , with a U@@ C Ber@@ kel@@ ey 30-@@ year long@@ itu@@ din@@ al study that exam@@ ined the photos of students in an old year@@ book , and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life .
P@@ layers who didn &apos;t smile in their pictures lived an average of only 7@@ 2.@@ 9 years , where players with be@@ aming s@@ miles lived an average of almost 80 years .
( Laughter ) The good news is that we &apos;re actually born smil@@ ing .
When they &apos;re born , babies continue to smile — initially , mostly in their sleep .
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
S@@ mil@@ ing is one of the most basic , bio@@ logically uni@@ form expressions of all humans .
In studies conducted in P@@ ap@@ u@@ a New Gu@@ ine@@ a , Paul E@@ k@@ man , the world &apos;s most ren@@ owned researcher on facial expressions , found that even members of the F@@ ore tribe , who were completely dis@@ connected from Western culture , and also known for their unusual can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ism rituals , ( Laughter ) attribu@@ ted s@@ miles to descrip@@ tions of situations the same way you and I would .
A recent study at U@@ pp@@ sal@@ a University in Sweden found that it &apos;s very difficult to fro@@ wn when looking at someone who s@@ miles .
M@@ im@@ ic@@ king a smile and experiencing it physically helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real , so we can understand the emotional state of the smil@@ er .
In a recent mi@@ mic@@ king study at the University of Cl@@ er@@ mon@@ t-@@ Fer@@ r@@ and in France , subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pen@@ cil in their mouth to repres@@ s smil@@ ing muscles .
( Laughter ) In addition to the@@ or@@ izing on evolution in &quot; &quot; The O@@ ri@@ gin of Sp@@ ec@@ ies , &quot; &quot; Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory .
( Laughter ) In a related German study , researchers used f@@ MRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after inj@@ ecting Bot@@ o@@ x to sup@@ press smil@@ ing muscles .
The finding supported Darwin &apos;s theory , by showing that facial feedback modi@@ fies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain , in a way that helps us feel better when we smile .
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate .
( Laughter ) Wait — The same study found that smil@@ ing is as stimul@@ ating as receiving up to 16@@ ,000 pounds ster@@ ling in cash . ( Laughter )
A recent study at Pen@@ n State University found that when you smile , you don &apos;t only appear to be more li@@ kable and cour@@ te@@ ous , but you actually appear to be more compe@@ tent .
So whenever you want to look great and compe@@ tent , reduce your stress or improve your marriage , or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-@@ quality chocolate without in@@ curr@@ ing the cal@@ or@@ ic cost , or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old j@@ ack@@ et you hadn &apos;t wor@@ n for ages , or whenever you want to tap into a super@@ power that will help you and everyone around you live a longer , healthier , happier life , smile .
I &apos;m Michael S@@ her@@ mer , director of the S@@ ke@@ p@@ tics So@@ ci@@ ety , publi@@ sh@@ er of &quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ p@@ tic &quot; &quot; magazine .
We investi@@ gate claims of the par@@ an@@ or@@ mal , p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ science , fr@@ in@@ ge groups and cul@@ ts , and claims of all kinds between , science and p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ science and non-@@ science and j@@ unk science , v@@ oo@@ do@@ o science , patho@@ logical science , bad science , non-@@ science , and plain old non-@@ sense .
And unless you &apos;ve been on Mars recently , you know there &apos;s a lot of that out there .
Some people call us deb@@ un@@ kers , which is kind of a negative term .
But let &apos;s face it , there &apos;s a lot of b@@ unk .
We are like the bun@@ ko squ@@ ads of the police de@@ part@@ ments out there — well , we &apos;re sort of like the R@@ al@@ p@@ h N@@ ad@@ ers of bad ideas , ( Laughter ) trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas .
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
I brought this with me , this was given to us by N@@ BC D@@ at@@ eline to test .
It &apos;s produced by the Qu@@ ad@@ ro Cor@@ por@@ ation of West Vir@@ gin@@ ia .
It &apos;s called the Qu@@ ad@@ ro 2000 D@@ ow@@ ser R@@ od .
( Laughter ) This was being sold to high-@@ school ad@@ mini@@ str@@ ators for $ 9@@ 00 ap@@ i@@ ece .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Ra@@ dio Sh@@ ack anten@@ na attached to it .
You could dow@@ se for all sorts of things , but this particular one was built to dow@@ se for mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana in students &apos; loc@@ kers .
( Laughter ) So the way it works is you go down the hall@@ way , and you see if it til@@ ts toward a particular loc@@ ker , and then you open the loc@@ ker .
So it looks something like this .
I &apos;ll show you .
( Laughter ) Well , it has kind of a righ@@ t-@@ lean@@ ing bias .
Well , this is science , so we &apos;ll do a controlled experiment .
It &apos;ll go this way for sure .
( Laughter ) Sir , do you want to empty your pockets , please , si@@ r ? ( Laughter )
So the question was , can it actually find mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana in students &apos; loc@@ kers ?
And the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But in science , we have to keep track of the mis@@ ses , not just the hits .
And that &apos;s probably the key lesson to my short talk here : This is how psych@@ ics work , a@@ stro@@ lo@@ gers , tar@@ ot card readers and so on .
People remember the hits and forget the mis@@ ses .
In science , we keep the whole database , and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you &apos;d expect by chance .
In this case , we tested it .
We had two op@@ a@@ que boxes : one with govern@@ ment@@ -@@ approved T@@ HC mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana , and one with nothing .
And it got it 50 percent of the time — ( Laughter ) which is exactly what you &apos;d expect with a co@@ in-@@ flip model .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
&quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ p@@ tic &quot; &quot; is the quar@@ terly publi@@ cation . Each one has a particular theme .
This one is on the future of intelligence .
Are people getting smarter or du@@ mber ?
I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I &apos;m in , but in fact , people , it turns out , are getting smarter .
Three I@@ Q points per 10 years , going up .
S@@ ort of an interesting thing .
With science , don &apos;t think of skep@@ tici@@ sm as a thing , or science as a thing .
Are science and religion comp@@ ati@@ ble ?
It &apos;s like , are science and plu@@ mb@@ ing comp@@ ati@@ ble ?
They &apos;re just two different things .
Science is not a thing . It &apos;s a ver@@ b .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about things .
It &apos;s a way of looking for natural explan@@ ations for all phenomena .
I mean , what &apos;s more likely : that extr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al int@@ el@@ li@@ gen@@ ces or multi-@@ dimensional beings travel across vast distances of inter@@ st@@ ell@@ ar space to leave a crop circle in Far@@ mer Bob &apos;s field in P@@ uck@@ er@@ brush , K@@ ansas to promote skep@@ tic@@ .com , our web page ?
Or is it more likely that a read@@ er of &quot; &quot; S@@ ke@@ p@@ tic &quot; &quot; did this with Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ hop ?
And in all cases we have to ask — ( Laughter ) What &apos;s the more likely explanation ?
Before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it &apos;s not in this world .
What &apos;s more likely : that Ar@@ no@@ ld had extr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al help in his run for the govern@@ or@@ ship , or that the &quot; &quot; World We@@ e@@ k@@ ly Ne@@ ws &quot; &quot; makes stuff up ?
( Laughter ) The same theme is expressed nic@@ ely here in this S@@ id@@ ney Har@@ ris cartoon .
For those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; &quot; Then a miracle occurs .
I think you need to be more exp@@ licit here in step two . &quot; &quot; This single slide completely dis@@ man@@ tles the intelligent design arguments .
There &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
( Applause ) You can say a miracle occurs , it &apos;s just that it doesn &apos;t explain anything or offer anything .
There &apos;s nothing to test .
It &apos;s the end of the conversation for intelligent design crea@@ tion@@ ists .
And it &apos;s true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as lin@@ gu@@ istic place f@@ ill@@ ers — dark energy or dark matter , something like that — until we figure out what it is , we &apos;ll call it this .
It &apos;s the beginning of the ca@@ us@@ al chain for science .
For intelligent design crea@@ tion@@ ists , it &apos;s the end of the chain .
So again , we can ask this : what &apos;s more likely ?
Are U@@ F@@ Os alien spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , or percep@@ tual cognitive mistakes , or even fa@@ kes ?
This is a U@@ F@@ O shot from my house in Al@@ ta@@ den@@ a , California , looking down over P@@ as@@ ad@@ ena .
And if it looks a lot like a Bu@@ ick hu@@ b@@ cap , it &apos;s because it is .
You don &apos;t even need Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ hop or high-tech equipment , you don &apos;t need computers .
This was shot with a thro@@ wa@@ way K@@ od@@ ak In@@ sta@@ matic camera .
You just have somebody off on the side with a hu@@ b@@ cap ready to go .
Cam@@ era &apos;s ready — that &apos;s it .
( Laughter ) So , although it &apos;s possible that most of these things are fake or ill@@ usions or so on , and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles .
On a more serious note , in all of science we &apos;re looking for a balance between data and theory .
In the case of Gal@@ ile@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
First of all , there was no theory of planetary rings .
Second of all , his data was gra@@ iny and fu@@ z@@ zy , and he couldn &apos;t quite make out what he was looking at .
So he wrote that he had seen — &quot; I have observed that the fur@@ the@@ st planet has three bodies . &quot;
And this is what he ended up conclu@@ ding that he saw .
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only gra@@ iny data , you can &apos;t have a good theory .
It wasn &apos;t solved until 16@@ 5@@ 5 .
This is Christi@@ a@@ an Hu@@ y@@ gen@@ s &apos;s book that catal@@ o@@ gs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn .
It wasn &apos;t till Hu@@ y@@ gen@@ s had two things : He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system oper@@ ated , and he had better teles@@ copic , more fin@@ e-@@ grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster — according to Ke@@ pl@@ er &apos;s La@@ ws — than Saturn , then we catch up with it .
And we see the angles of the rings at different angles , there .
And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive bi@@ ases .
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things , on a simple level , and then I &apos;ll go to more serious ones .
Like , we have a tendency to see faces .
This is the face on Mars .
In 197@@ 6 , where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was mon@@ u@@ mental architecture made by Marti@@ ans .
Here &apos;s the clos@@ e-@@ up of it from 2001 .
If you squ@@ int , you can still see the face .
And when you &apos;re squ@@ in@@ ting , you &apos;re turning that from fin@@ e-@@ grain to co@@ ar@@ se@@ -@@ grain , so you &apos;re reducing the quality of your data .
And if I didn &apos;t tell you what to look for , you &apos;d still see the face , because we &apos;re programmed by evolution to see faces .
F@@ ac@@ es are important for us socially .
And of course , happy faces , faces of all kinds are easy to see .
You see the happy face on Mars , there .
( Laughter ) If astronomers were fro@@ gs , perhaps they &apos;d see K@@ er@@ mit the F@@ ro@@ g .
Do you see him there ? Little fro@@ g@@ gy legs .
Or if ge@@ ologists were elephants ?
Re@@ li@@ gi@@ ous ic@@ on@@ ography .
( Laughter ) Dis@@ covered by a T@@ en@@ nes@@ see ba@@ ker in 199@@ 6 .
He charged five bucks a head to come see the nu@@ n bu@@ n till he got a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ and-@@ des@@ ist from Mother Ter@@ es@@ a &apos;s lawyer .
Here &apos;s Our L@@ ady of Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ up@@ e and Our L@@ ady of Wat@@ son@@ ville , just down the street , or is it up the street from here ?
T@@ ree b@@ ark is particularly good because it &apos;s nice and gra@@ iny , bran@@ ch@@ y , black@@ -and-@@ white spl@@ ot@@ ch@@ y and you can get the patter@@ n-@@ seeking — humans are patter@@ n-@@ seeking animals .
Here &apos;s the Vir@@ gin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sa@@ o Pa@@ ul@@ o .
Here &apos;s when the Vir@@ gin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich — which I got to actually hold in a L@@ as V@@ e@@ gas cas@@ ino — of course , this being America .
( Laughter ) This cas@@ ino paid $ 2@@ 8@@ ,500 on e@@ Bay for the cheese sandwich . ( Laughter )
But who does it really look like ? The Vir@@ gin Mary ? ( Laughter )
It has that sort of p@@ uck@@ ered li@@ ps , 194@@ 0@@ s-@@ era look .
Vir@@ gin Mary in C@@ lear@@ water , Florida .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there .
The fai@@ th@@ ful come in their wheel@@ chairs and cru@@ t@@ ches , and so on .
We went down and investi@@ gated .
Just to give you a size , that &apos;s D@@ awk@@ ins , me and The Ama@@ zing R@@ and@@ i , next to this two , two and a half stor@@ y-@@ sized image .
All these cand@@ les , thousands of cand@@ les people had lit in tribu@@ te to this .
So we walked around the back@@ side , to see what was going on .
It turns out wherever there &apos;s a sp@@ rin@@ k@@ ler head and a palm tree , you get the effect .
Here &apos;s the Vir@@ gin Mary on the back@@ side , which they started to wi@@ pe off .
I guess you can only have one miracle per building .
( Laughter ) So is it really a miracle of Mary , or is it a miracle of Mar@@ ge ? ( Laughter )
And now I &apos;m going to finish up with another example of this , with audit@@ ory ill@@ usions .
There &apos;s this film , &quot; &quot; White No@@ ise , &quot; &quot; with Michael Ke@@ at@@ on , about the dead talking back to us .
By the way , the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal .
Any@@ body can do it , turns out .
It &apos;s getting the dead to talk back that &apos;s the really hard part .
( Laughter ) In this case , sup@@ pos@@ edly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena .
There &apos;s a Re@@ ver@@ se@@ Spe@@ ech@@ .com web page where I down@@ loaded this stuff .
This is the most famous one of all of these .
Here &apos;s the forward version of the very famous song .
( Music with ly@@ ri@@ cs ) If there &apos;s a bu@@ st@@ le in your he@@ d@@ ger@@ ow don &apos;t be al@@ armed now .
It &apos;s just a spring clean for the May Queen .
Yes , there are two paths you can go by , but in the long run , There &apos;s still time to change the road you &apos;re on .
( Music ends ) C@@ ouldn &apos;t you just listen to that all day ?
All right , here it is backwards , and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are sup@@ pos@@ edly in there .
( Music with un@@ int@@ el@@ li@@ gible ly@@ ri@@ cs ) ( L@@ y@@ ri@@ cs ) Sat@@ an !
( Un@@ int@@ el@@ li@@ gible ly@@ ri@@ cs continue ) What did you get ? Audience : Sat@@ an !
Sat@@ an . OK , at least we got &quot; &quot; Sat@@ an &quot; &quot; .
Now , I &apos;ll prime the audit@@ ory part of your brain to tell you what you &apos;re supposed to hear , and then hear it again .
( Music with ly@@ ri@@ cs ) ( Music ends ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) You can &apos;t miss it when I tell you what &apos;s there . ( Laughter )
I &apos;m going to just end with a positive , nice little story .
The S@@ ke@@ p@@ tics is a non@@ profit educational organization .
We &apos;re always looking for little good things that people do .
And in England , there &apos;s a pop sing@@ er .
One of the top popular sing@@ ers in England today , K@@ ati@@ e M@@ el@@ u@@ a .
And she wrote a beautiful song .
It was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; &quot; N@@ ine Mil@@ lion B@@ ic@@ y@@ cles in Beij@@ ing . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a love story — she &apos;s sort of the Nor@@ ah J@@ ones of the U@@ K — about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicy@@ cles , and so forth .
And she has this one pass@@ age here .
( Music ) ( L@@ y@@ ri@@ cs ) We are 12 billion ligh@@ t-@@ years from the edge That &apos;s a guess , No one can ever say it &apos;s true , But I know that I will always be with you .
Michael S@@ her@@ mer : Well , that &apos;s nice . At least she got it close .
In America it &apos;d be , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re 6,000 light years from the edge . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) But my friend , Sim@@ on S@@ in@@ gh , the particle physicist now turned science educa@@ tor , who wrote the book &quot; &quot; The Big Bang , &quot; &quot; and so on , uses every chance he gets to promote good science .
And so he wrote an op@@ -@@ ed piece in &quot; &quot; The Gu@@ ar@@ dian &quot; &quot; about K@@ ati@@ e &apos;s song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how far from the edge .
You know , it &apos;s 13@@ .@@ 7 billion light years , and it &apos;s not a guess .
We know within precise error bars how close it is .
So we can say , although not absolutely true , it &apos;s pretty close to being true .
And , to his credit , K@@ ati@@ e called him up after this op@@ -@@ ed piece came out , and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so embarras@@ sed . I was in the astron@@ omy club .
I should &apos;ve known better . &quot; &quot; And she re-@@ cut the song .
So I will end with the new version .
( Music with ly@@ ri@@ cs ) We are 13@@ .@@ 7 billion light years from the edge of the obser@@ vable universe .
That &apos;s a good estimate with well-@@ defined error bars .
And with the available information , I predict that I will always be with you .
( Laughter ) How cool is that ?
( Applause )
In the 1980s in the communi@@ st Eastern Germany , if you owned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
You had to regi@@ ster a sample sheet of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restri@@ ct freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufac@@ tu@@ rer and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a f@@ us@@ s about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
Like here , we have Mr. D@@ im@@ it@@ ry Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
And the mo@@ tives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ sa@@ st@@ s@@ in form T@@ art@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is Stephen Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ und@@ in .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w Anderson , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking tro@@ j@@ ans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with key@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Sec@@ re@@ t Ser@@ vice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the Swiss bank account of Mr. S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the lo@@ ose ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
They &apos;re motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laugh@@ s .
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ ony@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : criminals who do it for the money , hack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ ony@@ mous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate Au@@ th@@ ority from The Ne@@ ther@@ lands — or actually , it was .
It was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were h@@ acked into .
Somebody broke in and they h@@ acked it thor@@ ough@@ ly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government represen@@ ta@@ tives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pla@@ usi@@ ble that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .A.
They sell certi@@ fi@@ cates .
What do you do with certi@@ fi@@ cates ?
Well you need a certi@@ fi@@ cate if you have a website that has h@@ tt@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L encryp@@ ted services , services like G@@ mail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like Iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ worthy than the local services and they are encryp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .
Except they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign C@@ .A.
and issue ro@@ gue certi@@ fi@@ cates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
What about Arab Spr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
Well in Egypt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ oted the head@@ quarters of the Egypti@@ an secret police in April 2011 , and when they were lo@@ oting the building they found lots of papers .
Am@@ ong those papers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ tled &quot; &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot; &quot; And within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egypti@@ an government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting — and in very large scale — all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the Egypti@@ an government .
The company head@@ quarters are right here .
So Western governments are providing tot@@ al@@ itarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by German government officials to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will tap your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your passwords .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; &quot; And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
( Music ) ( Applause ) Thank you for being here .
And I say &quot; &quot; thank you for being here &quot; &quot; because I was silent for 17 years .
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington , D@@ .C. , on the 20th anni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth Day .
And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; My mother , out in the audience , she jumped up , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ j@@ ah , John@@ ny ’ s talking ! &quot;
( Laughter ) Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
My dad said to me , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one &quot; &quot; — I ’ ll explain that .
But I turned around because I didn ’ t recognize where my voice was coming from .
I hadn ’ t heard my voice in 17 years , so I turned around and I looked and I said , &quot; God , who &apos;s saying what I ’ m thinking ? &quot;
And then I realized it was me , you know , and I kind of laugh@@ ed .
And I could see my father : &quot; &quot; Yeah , he really is crazy . &quot; &quot; Well , I want to take you on this journey .
And the journey , I believe , is a metaphor for all of our jour@@ neys .
Even though this one is kind of unusual , I want you to think about your own journey .
My journey began in 197@@ 1 when I witnessed two oil tan@@ kers colli@@ de beneath the Gol@@ den G@@ ate , and a half a million gall@@ ons of oil sp@@ illed into the b@@ ay .
It dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up ri@@ ding and driving in motor@@ ized vehicles .
That ’ s a big thing in California .
And it was a big thing in my little community of Po@@ int R@@ eyes S@@ tation in In@@ ver@@ ness , California , because there were only about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in &apos; 7@@ 1 now .
And so when I came in and I started walking around , people — they just knew what was going on .
And people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; &quot; John , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; And I ’ d say , &quot; &quot; Well , I ’ m walking for the environment . &quot; &quot; And they said , &quot; &quot; No , you ’ re walking to make us look bad , right ?
You ’ re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; &quot; And maybe there was some truth to that , because I thought that if I started walking , everyone would follow .
Because of the oil , everybody talked about the pol@@ ll@@ ution .
And so I argu@@ ed with people about that , I argu@@ ed and I argu@@ ed .
I called my parents up .
I said , &quot; &quot; I ’ ve given up ri@@ ding and driving in cars . &quot; &quot; My dad said , &quot; &quot; Why didn ’ t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I didn ’ t know about the environment then .
They ’ re back in Phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a .
And so I told my mother , &quot; &quot; I ’ m happy though , I ’ m really happy . &quot; &quot; She said , &quot; &quot; If you were happy , son , you wouldn ’ t have to say it . &quot; &quot; M@@ others are like that .
And so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th birthday I decided , because I argu@@ ed so much and I talk so much , that I was going to stop speaking for just one day — one day — to give it a rest .
And so I did .
I got up in the morning and I didn ’ t say a word .
And I have to tell you , it was a very moving experience , because for the first time , I began listening — in a long time .
And what I heard , it kind of dist@@ ur@@ bed me .
Because what I used to do , when I thought I was listening , was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could — I knew what they were going to say , and so I stopped listening .
And in my mind , I just kind of rac@@ ed ahead and thought of what I was going to say back , while they were still fin@@ ishing up .
And then I would launch in .
Well , that just ended communication .
So on this first day I actually listened .
And it was very sad for me , because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning .
I was 27 . I thought I knew everything .
I didn ’ t .
And so I decided I ’ d better do this for another day , and another day , and another day until finally , I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more .
So for a year I said I would keep quiet , and then on my birthday I would reas@@ s@@ ess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again .
Well , that la@@ sted 17 years .
Now during that time — those 17 years — I walked and I played the ban@@ j@@ o and I painted and I wrote in my journal , and I tried to study the environment by reading books .
And I decided that I was going to go to school . So I did .
I walked up to A@@ sh@@ land , O@@ reg@@ on , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
It ’ s only 500 miles .
And I went into the Re@@ gi@@ stra@@ r ’ s office and — &quot; What , what , what ? &quot;
I had a newspaper cli@@ pping .
&quot; &quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
You don ’ t … ?
We have a special program for you . &quot; &quot; They did .
And in those two years , I graduated with my first degree — a b@@ ac@@ hel@@ or ’ s degree .
And my father came out , he was so proud .
He said , &quot; &quot; Listen , we ’ re really proud of you son , but what are you going to do with a b@@ ac@@ hel@@ or ’ s degree ?
You don ’ t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk — you ’ re going to have to do those things . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I hun@@ ched my shoulder , I picked my back@@ pack up again and I started walking .
I walked all the way up to P@@ ort To@@ w@@ n@@ send , Washington , where I built a woo@@ den boat , ro@@ de it across Pu@@ get S@@ ound and walked across Washington &#91; to &#93; I@@ da@@ h@@ o and down to Mis@@ sou@@ la , Mon@@ tan@@ a .
I had written the University of Mon@@ tan@@ a two years earlier and said I &apos;d like to go to school there .
I said I &apos;d be there in about two years .
( Laughter ) And I was there . I showed up in two years and they — I tell this story because they really helped me .
There are two stories in Mon@@ tan@@ a .
The first story is I didn ’ t have any money — that ’ s a sign I used a lot .
And they said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; &quot; The director of the program said , &quot; &quot; Come back tomorrow . &quot; &quot; He gave me 150 dollars , and he said , &quot; &quot; Re@@ gi@@ ster for one credit .
You ’ re going to go to South America , aren ’ t you ? &quot; &quot; And I said — Ri@@ vers and la@@ kes , the hydro@@ logical systems , South America .
So I did that .
He came back ; he said to me , &quot; &quot; OK John , now that you &apos;ve regi@@ ster@@ ed for that one credit , you can have a key to an office , you can mat@@ ricul@@ ate — you ’ re mat@@ ricul@@ ating , so you can use the library .
And what we ’ re going to do is , we ’ re going to have all of the prof@@ ess@@ ors allow you to go to class .
They ’ re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can regi@@ ster for that class and they ’ ll give you the grade . &quot; &quot; Wow , they don ’ t do that in graduate schools , I don ’ t think .
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me .
They saw that I was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
And during that time , I actually taught classes without speaking .
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class .
I explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that I was John Fr@@ anc@@ is , I was walking around the world , I didn ’ t talk and this was the last time this person ’ s going to be here interpre@@ ting for me .
All the students sat around and they went ...
( Laughter ) I could see they were looking for the sch@@ edu@@ le , to see when they could get out .
They had to take that class with me .
Two weeks later , everyone was trying to get into our class .
And I learned in that class — because I would do things like this ...
and they were all gathered around , going , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s he trying to say ? &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , I think he &apos;s talking about clear cutting . &quot; &quot; Yeah , clear cutting . &quot;
&quot; No , no , no , that &apos;s not clear cutting , that ’ s — he &apos;s using a hand@@ saw . &quot;
&quot; Well , you can ’ t clear@@ cut with a ... &quot;
&quot; Yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
&quot; No , I think he ’ s talking about sel@@ ective fore@@ stry . &quot;
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
I just b@@ acked out of that , you know , and I just kind of kept the fi@@ sts from flying .
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean , but I should have .
And so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren ’ t learning you probably weren ’ t teaching very well .
And so I went on .
My dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , I did the deal , and my father said , &quot; &quot; We ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot; &quot; You know what went on , he said , &quot; &quot; You ’ ve got to start ri@@ ding and driving and start talking .
What are you going to do with a master ’ s degree ? &quot; &quot; I hun@@ ched my shoulder , I got my back@@ pack and I went on to the University of W@@ is@@ con@@ s@@ in .
I spent two years there writing on oil sp@@ ills .
No one was interested in oil sp@@ ills .
But something happened — Ex@@ x@@ on Val@@ de@@ z .
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil sp@@ ills .
My dad came out again .
He said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how you do this , son — I mean , you don &apos;t ride in cars , you don ’ t talk .
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you ’ re not saying anything . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Well , I put on my back@@ pack again .
I put my ban@@ j@@ o on and I walked all the way to the East Coast , put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean — it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States .
And on Earth Day , 1990 — the 20th anni@@ vers@@ ary of Earth Day — that ’ s when I began to speak .
And that ’ s why I said , &quot; &quot; Thank you for being here . &quot; &quot; Because it &apos;s sort of like that tree in the forest falling ; and if there &apos;s no one there to hear , does it really make a sound ?
And I ’ m th@@ an@@ king you , and I &apos;m th@@ an@@ king my family because they had come to hear me speak .
And that ’ s communication .
And they also taught me about listening — that they listened to me .
And it ’ s one of those things that came out of the silence , the listening to each other .
Really , very important — we need to listen to each other .
Well , my journey kept going on .
My dad said , &quot; &quot; That ’ s one , &quot; &quot; and I still didn ’ t let that go .
I worked for the Co@@ ast@@ guard , was made a U.N. Goo@@ d@@ will A@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ dor .
I wrote regul@@ ations for the United States — I mean , I wrote oil sp@@ ill regul@@ ations .
20 years ago , if someone had said to me , &quot; John , do you really want to make a difference ? &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I want to make a difference . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; You just start walking east ; get out of your car and just start walking east . &quot; &quot; And as I walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; Yeah , and shut up , too . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You ’ re going to make a difference , bud@@ dy . &quot;
How could that be , how could that be ?
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
Well , my time at the Coast Gu@@ ard was a really good time .
And after that — I only worked one year — I said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s enough . One year &apos;s enough for me to do that . &quot; &quot; I got on a sa@@ il@@ boat and I sa@@ iled down to the C@@ ari@@ b@@ bean , and walked through all of the islands , and to V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ ela .
And you know , I forgot the most important thing , which is why I started talking , which I have to tell you .
I started talking because I had studied environment .
I ’ d studied environment at this formal level , but there was this in@@ formal level .
And the in@@ formal level — I learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other .
Because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
And so that ’ s the message that I had .
And I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to have to spread that message . &quot; &quot; And I got in my sa@@ il@@ boat , sa@@ iled all the way through the C@@ ari@@ b@@ bean — it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ boat , I kind of worked on that boat — got to V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ ela and I started walking .
This is the last part of this story , because it ’ s how I got here , because I still didn &apos;t ride in motor@@ ized vehicles .
I was walking through E@@ l D@@ or@@ a@@ do — it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or inf@@ am@@ ous prison — in V@@ ene@@ z@@ u@@ ela , and I don ’ t know what pos@@ s@@ essed me , because this was not like me .
There I am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ ap@@ ort@@ e , pas@@ ap@@ ort@@ e , &quot; &quot; and with an M@@ 16 pointed at me .
And I looked at him and I said , &quot; &quot; P@@ as@@ sport , hu@@ h ?
I don &apos;t need to show you my pas@@ sport . It ’ s in the back of my pack .
I &apos;m Dr. Fr@@ anc@@ is ; I &apos;m a U.N. A@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ dor and I &apos;m walking around the world . &quot; &quot; And I started walking off .
What pos@@ s@@ essed me to say this thing ?
The road turned into the jun@@ gle .
I didn ’ t get shot .
And I got to — I start saying , &quot; &quot; F@@ ree at last — thank God Al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I ’ m free at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What was that about , &quot; &quot; I ’ m saying . What was that about ?
It took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , I had become a prisoner .
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape .
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motor@@ ized vehicles .
Now how could that be ?
Because when I started , it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motor@@ ized vehicles .
But the thing that was different was that every birthday , I asked myself about silence , but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. A@@ mb@@ as@@ sa@@ dor .
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me , and that I was going to have to change .
You know , we can do it .
I was going to have to change .
And I was afraid to change , because I was so used to the guy who only just walked .
I was so used to that person that I didn ’ t want to stop .
I didn ’ t know who I would be if I changed .
But I know I needed to .
I know I needed to change , because it would be the only way that I could be here today .
And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we ’ ve gotten to , but there ’ s another place for us to go .
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we ’ ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
And so , I want to encourage you to go to that next place , to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in , as comfortable as it may be , because we have to do something now .
We have to change now .
As our former V@@ ice President said , we have to become activists .
So if my voice can touch you , if my actions can touch you , if my being here can touch you , please let it be .
And I know that all of you have touched me while I ’ ve been here .
So , let ’ s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we ’ ve shown each other right here at TED , and take this out into the world .
Because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is O@@ ak Street , that &apos;s El@@ m Street .
This is 2@@ 6@@ th , that &apos;s 2@@ 7@@ th . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
Stre@@ ets have names ; blocks are just the un@@ named spaces in between streets . &quot; &quot; He leaves , a little confused and disap@@ pointed .
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s B@@ lock 17 and this is B@@ lock 16 . &quot; &quot; And you say , &quot; &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot; &quot; And they say , &quot; &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
B@@ lo@@ cks have names .
Just look at Google M@@ aps here . There &apos;s B@@ lock 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the un@@ named spaces in between the blocks .
And you say then , &quot; &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Well , easy , this is Di@@ stri@@ ct E@@ ight .
There &apos;s B@@ lock 17 , house number one . &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot; &quot; He says , &quot; &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot; &quot; So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
But in West African music , the &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
So , you can hear it not just in the phr@@ asing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also accurate .
( Laughter ) There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
